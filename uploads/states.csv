Kopsky's organization is a member of Protect AR Rights. (Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Two Arkansas civic action groups will kick off a town hall tour Tuesday in Little Rock to promote a direct democracy ballot initiative their coalition hopes to put on the 2026 ballot, according to a news release.
The event, to be held at First United Methodist Church of Little Rock at 6 p.m., will feature a panel from the Arkansas Public Policy Panel and Citizens First Congress to answer questions about the ballot measures.
Three other town halls are planned — Fort Smith on Sept. 23, Conway on Oct. 14 and Clinton on Nov. 4.
The coalition is looking to roll back 13 laws targeting Arkansas’ direct democracy process that passed during the 2025 legislative session. The laws generally imposed more requirements on ballot committees trying to put issues to voters at the ballot box.
While proponents of the legislation have said the changes are necessary to safeguard the direct democracy process, Protect AR Rights and other organizations opposed to the laws say they are overly restrictive and interfere with citizens’ rights.
Those news laws have already posed obstacles to those wishing to roll them back — specifically Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits the attorney general from certifying a ballot title if it is above an eighth grade reading level. Protect AR Rights — one of two organizations with approved ballot titles relating to the direct democracy laws — had its title certified in July after two previous rejections.
As opposed to lawmaking by elected officials, the direct democracy process allows Arkansas citizens to propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. It also allows citizens to attempt to repeal legislation by the same process. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Protect AR Rights’ proposed ballot measure would repeal several changes made during the session by explicitly prohibiting Arkansas legislators from amending or repealing a constitutional amendment approved by voters, requiring voters to be notified if their petition signature will be disqualified and given an opportunity to correct any problems, and requiring signatures to be gathered from at least 15 counties instead of 50.
In order for an organization to put its proposed legislation or constitutional amendment to voters, it must have its ballot title certified by the attorney general, who determines whether the title meets the requirements stipulated in the state constitution and state law. Once the title is certified, ballot committees must gather a certain number of signatures in order for the measure to appear on the ballot.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kopsky-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-15 20:56:48.252916

On Monday, the National Weather Service issued a flood warning for Juneau’s Mendenhall Valley after river and lake measurements showed signs of another major release of water from Suicide Basin, an ice-locked lake typically contained by the Mendenhall Glacier.
As of Monday afternoon, the flood was expected to crest between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Tuesday morning, just below 12 feet.
If that holds true, it would be less severe than the record inundation that took place in August or the destructive floods that soaked hundreds of homes last year.
Nicole Ferrin, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Juneau said on Monday afternoon, “As of right now, we’re looking at a crest sometime Tuesday morning, between 11 and 12 feet.”
That would be enough to put water into some low-lying homes near the Mendenhall River, but most other nearby homes are protected by temporary flood barriers erected last winter.
The flood in August topped out at a record-breaking 16.65 feet, below the top of the flood barriers.
“In an abundance of caution, we are recommending that folks in the View Drive area evacuate their homes this evening or just spend the night somewhere else again,” said Ryan O’Shaughnessy, the emergency programs manager for the City and Borough of Juneau, referring to the lowest-lying homes near the river. 
“These floods are dynamic. They take a lot of material and change the shape of the river and lake at each event, and our No. 1 priority is always going to be the protection of life and public safety. We really encourage people to not take any chances and folks in that area, please consider spending the night somewhere else,” he said.
The city does not plan to set up an emergency shelter, and it did not send widespread text alerts to all cellphones in the area, as it did in August.
“We do not believe that there is the same risk to life and safety,” O’Shaughnessy said.
This latest flood continues a pattern that has taken place since 2011: A large summer flood is followed by one or more smaller fall floods.
Last year, after the summer flood inundated parts of the Mendenhall Valley, a flood in October crested just below 11 feet.
This month’s flood is “pretty similar” to what happened last year, but recent heavy rain is expected to contribute to higher water.
Forecasters will update their flood predictions late Monday, Ferrin said. A website hosted by the National Weather Service has the latest information.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCF7634-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 20:56:48.252916

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — What would have been Oklahoma City’s first public Montessori school is now defunct.
The Oklahoma City Board of Education voted unanimously Monday to rescind its charter contract with Oklahoma Public Montessori Initiative. The rescission is a mutual agreement with the charter school, which failed to complete the necessary steps to open as planned for the 2025-26 academic year.
The Oklahoma City board agreed to authorize the school’s founding contract in November 2023, despite Oklahoma City Public Schools administrators deeming the charter application as “insufficient in a number of areas.”
The charter school would have educated children in pre-K through fourth grade in far northwest Oklahoma City with the Montessori method of education, which is known for student-led, hands-on learning.
The board first considered the possibility of revoking its authorization of the charter school in June when it sent a notice of potential breach of contract. At the time, district staff and school board members expressed alarm at the lack of progress toward opening.
By that time, most of the school’s founding board members had left, according to a district report. The school had not secured a facility, and all of its expenditures were paused on May 2.
After the Oklahoma City board issued its warning, district administrators continued discussions with the school “about what’s best for both entities and what’s best for our students,” said Tony Childers, the district’s general counsel.
“As part of that conversation, the charter school agreed that, really, at this point it’d be best for us to just mutually rescind that agreement,” Childers said. “There wouldn’t be any action necessary in terms of the revocation. We just believed that would be best for the students, for us at this point to cut our ties.”

Nothing in the agreement forbids the school’s founders from reapplying for charter authorization in the future, Childers confirmed.
The head of the charter school’s board, Rico Smith, did not immediately return a request for comment after the rescission vote Monday evening. Bill Hickman, an attorney working with the school, declined to comment.
Although Oklahoma Public Montessori Initiative is no more, other public Montessori programs are opening in the city.
A different Montessori charter school and early childhood center is preparing to open its doors in the 2026-27 academic year. P3 Urban Montessori will enroll 90 students age 3 through kindergarten in the 73111 ZIP code in northeast Oklahoma City.
The Oklahoma City board rejected an application to authorize P3 in the same 2023 meeting that it approved Oklahoma Public Montessori Initiative.

P3’s founders, including Millwood Public Schools Superintendent Cecilia Robinson-Woods and her sister Rosalyn Robinson, later obtained a charter contract with the Statewide Charter School Board.
The Oklahoma City district also started offering Montessori-inspired education this school year. 
After hearing community interest in a Montessori program, Horace Mann Pre-K Center opened two classrooms with that style of instruction, said Stephanie Hinton, the district’s executive director of early childhood. 
Several Montessori private schools operate in the area around Horace Mann, located at Northwest 46th Street and North Western Avenue, and similar programs in Tulsa Public Schools have been popular, she said.
Two teachers at Horace Mann built up the program and completed specialized Montessori training over the summer, along with an assistant principal and the district’s early childhood coordinator, Hinton said.
“I have a feeling it won’t be our only Montessori-inspired program,” she said. “We’re just not quite sure where that expansion is going to lead to just yet.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Supreme Court has denied the Legislature’s petition to block a district court judge’s decision that tossed out the state’s 2021 congressional boundaries and ordered a process to draw a new one.
“For the reasons explained below, we deny Legislative Defendants’ petition,” the Utah Supreme Court wrote in a decision issued Monday. 
“Their arguments focus largely on the district court’s remedial process, but they have not appealed from the order putting that process in place,” the order said, adding that instead legislative attorneys challenged 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s denial of their motion to pause the court’s injunction that voided the 2021 congressional map. 
“However, their complaints about the remedial process do not demonstrate that the court’s denial of the stay order is legally wrong or that the court otherwise abused its Discretion,” the Utah Supreme Court opinion says. “Without that, they have not shown why they should receive the extraordinary relief they seek here.”
Anti-gerrymandering plaintiffs cite ‘irony’ in Utah lawmakers’ appeal to Utah Supreme Court

Mark Gaber, an attorney with the Campaign Legal Center which is representing the plaintiffs in the anti-gerrymandering lawsuit, celebrated the ruling in a post on X Monday evening. 
“One step closer to a fair congressional map for 2026!” Gaber wrote. 
Better Boundaries’ executive director Elizabeth Rasmussen issued a statement applauding the decision.  
“Further delay would be in direct opposition to the principles of the Utah Constitution. We’re thrilled this process will move forward on the previously agreed-upon timeline, putting fair congressional maps in place by November 10th,” Rasmussen said. “Utahns will now see the standards they voted for put into practice. That means fewer splits of cities and counties, compact and connected districts, preservation of neighborhoods and communities, and a ban on maps designed to give unfair advantage to politicians or parties.”
While Rasmussen acknowledged legislative defendants’ larger appeal is still pending in court, Monday’s “decision keeps the process moving and affirms the principle that voters, not politicians, choose their representatives.”
Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a joint statement that “a rushed timeline is not the best approach for determining congressional districts nor for setting public policy.”
“Despite this, the Legislature will move forward to the best of its ability,” Schultz and Adams said. “A committee has been formed, the court’s timeline will be followed and Utahns can provide input on the legislative map at redistricting.utah.gov starting Sept. 25.”
Monday’s decision is the latest development in a complex, yearslong lawsuit that has challenged Utah’s redistricting process. Plaintiffs — the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, and several Salt Lake County voters — have alleged that the state’s current congressional boundaries were blatant gerrymandering after lawmakers unconstitutionally repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ 2018 ballot initiative that sought to create an independent redistricting commission. 
Last month, Gibson agreed with the latter claim — that the 2021 Utah Legislature violated the Utah Constitution when it passed SB200, a law that turned that independent redistricting commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ultimately ignore, which is what they did when the GOP-controlled Legislature enacted the 2021 congressional map. 
GOP legislative leaders begrudgingly say they’ll redraw Utah’s congressional map, as court ordered

Gibson ruled that the 2021 map was the result of an unconstitutional process, and ordered it to be “remedied” in time for the 2026 election. 
While the Legislature’s attorneys have continued fighting the ruling in court, Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders have begrudgingly said they will comply with Gibson’s ruling and will convene the Legislature to vote on a new map. 
Meanwhile, both parties in the redistricting lawsuit have agreed on a timeline for the court-ordered process to enact a new map before Nov. 10, which the lieutenant governor’s office has said is the final deadline for a new map so county clerks have time to finalize their voting precincts in time for January, when 2026 candidates can begin filing to run. 
The timeline is as follows, according to court documents: 

Sept. 25: The Utah Legislature will publish its new proposed map. 
Sept. 26 to Oct. 5: Lawmakers will hold a public comment period to take input on the map.
Oct. 6: The Legislature will take a final vote on the map and submit it to the court for consideration. Plaintiffs will also have the same deadline to submit any proposed maps to the judge. 
Oct. 17: The deadline for both parties to file briefs, expert reports, and other materials in support or opposition to map submissions, if necessary. 
Oct. 23 to Oct. 24: The court will hold an evidentiary hearing, if necessary. 
Oct. 28: The deadline for parties to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with the court, if necessary. 
Nov. 10: The latest possible date for the court to select a final map, according to the lieutenant governor’s office. 

Earlier this month, as legislative defendants’ petition made its way through the Utah Supreme Court, Gibson filed an amendment to her previous, Aug. 25 ruling that officially adopted the timeline while also removing the “order” that required the Legislature to “design and enact” a new congressional map in 30 days. 
Utah Supreme Court will consider lawmakers’ appeal against drawing new congressional map

“That ‘order’ failed to recognize the separation of powers between our courts and our legislature and unintentionally failed to respect the Legislature’s authority to determine how to address the Court’s order enjoining H.B. 2004,” Gibson wrote. “This Court overstepped its authority by ordering the Legislature to enact a new congressional plan.”
However, that doesn’t stop the court-ordered process from playing out to draw a new map, which Gibson ruled was the byproduct of an unconstitutional process. While her ruling allows the Legislature to decide whether to submit a map or not, the court still retains jurisdiction over selecting a new map to be used in the 2026 election — whether it’s submitted by lawmakers or by the lawsuit’s plaintiffs. 
Monday’s ruling isn’t the first time the Utah Supreme Court has sided with plaintiffs in the anti-gerrymandering lawsuit. 
Last summer, all five justices on the court issued a unanimous opinion sending the case back to district court, ruling that Gibson had erred when she previously dismissed the claim that the Legislature violated the constitution when it repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ ballot initiative. That ruling also made clear that the Utah Legislature did not have unfettered power to repeal and replace all types of voter initiatives, but rather must show a “compelling government interest” in order to change “government reform” initiatives.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Planned Parenthood of Montana said it will work with patients who use Medicaid in the state to ensure they can continue to receive health care.
President and CEO Martha Fuller said Monday the organization is focused on keeping its four health centers open despite an estimated reimbursement funding gap of nearly $1 million.
“We are going to have to rely on our communities to step up, and we’ll be focused heavily on fundraising and gaining community support so we can continue to keep those doors open and see those folks,” Fuller said.
The statements from Planned Parenthood of Montana come after a court order last week blocked more than 1.1 million patients from using Medicaid at Planned Parenthood health centers to pay for routine services not related to abortion.
Those centers, including four in Montana, provide care such as family planning, STI testing and treatments, cancer screenings, birth control, breast exams, and other services.
Federal law already blocks Medicaid funding from going toward abortion, albeit with exceptions.
The “big, beautiful” budget bill this year prevented Medicaid funds from covering other care at organizations that provide abortions and receive more than $800,000 in reimbursements in a year — or Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood sued in federal district court in Massachusetts over the provision.
Thursday, a three-judge panel from the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court decision to temporarily block that part of the law.
The order means the law can take effect while the case continues.
The brief order did not offer an explanation but said the defendants, the the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, “met their burden to show their entitlement” to stop the previous court decisions.
In a statement, Fuller said the ruling amounts to a decision to “defund” Planned Parenthood as the case plays out.
Planned Parenthood said at least 200 of its health centers are at risk of closure across the country as a result of the order. In Montana, the organization operates in Lewis and Clark, Cascade, Missoula and Yellowstone counties.
In an interview with the Daily Montanan, Fuller said Planned Parenthood of Montana is doing everything it can to keep its health centers open in the state.
“That is our No. 1 priority,” Fuller said.
Fuller said health centers are working with patients to find out if they qualify for discounted services through Title X, a federal family planning grant program, or if there is another Medicaid provider they could see.
“They’re really hard conversations, and they’re happening now every day in our health centers,” Fuller said.
She said Title X does not cover some services, including abortion care or gender-affirming care, for patients who are transgender.
Planned Parenthood of Montana said it has been part of the health care system in Montana for more than 56 years.
Roughly one third of the 10,000 patients who receive care at Planned Parenthood centers in Montana use Medicaid.
Planned Parenthood health centers already have talked with patients who are concerned about the lack of Medicaid coverage for services, Fuller said.
That’s because since the federal bill was signed, Planned Parenthood has seen one day, and then later one week, where it wasn’t able to bill Medicaid as the lawsuit unfolded.
“This time, we’re going to be in this situation for a longer period,” Fuller said.
She said Montana already has vast areas that don’t have access to family planning, abortion care, gender-affirming care, or even primary care services.
But the health centers don’t turn people away, she said, and some have had relationships with providers for five years, sometimes 20 years.
“This fight is not over — we will work with every patient to get them the affordable care they need and continue to push for everyone’s freedom to get high-quality care at the trusted provider of their choice — including at Planned Parenthood health centers,” Fuller said in a statement. “No matter what, personal medical decisions should be between a patient and their provider.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1312832687.jpg,,,2025-09-15 20:56:48.252916

Lighthiser v. Trump
The Daily Montanan will be following the hearings this week in federal court in Missoula. To catch our stories, subscribe to the Treasure State Update, our weekday newsletter, here.
Read about the lawsuit here, and about Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen’s desire to dismiss it here.


Their victory in Held v. Montana, later upheld by the state Supreme Court, resounded across the country, showing that young people have a stake in the issue of climate change, advocates say. Yet, state policies to address the causes of climate change in Montana — home to large coal, oil, and natural gas deposits — haven’t changed in the wake of the case.
This week, some of those plaintiffs are scheduled to appear in federal court to request that U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen block a series of President Donald Trump’s executive orders on energy issues. They argue the orders violate their Fifth Amendment rights and will cause nearly 200,000 additional deaths over the next 25 years and lead to more heart, respiratory, and other health problems. They are joined by other plaintiffs ages 7 to 24 from California, Florida, Hawaii, and Oregon, and are backed by the climate-focused nonprofit Our Children’s Trust.
“Trump’s fossil fuel orders are a death sentence for my generation,” Eva Lighthiser, a 19-year-old resident of Livingston wrote in the complaint filed on May 29. “I am not suing because I want to, I am suing because I have to. My health, my future and my right to speak the truth are all on the line.”
She added that a warming climate has led to an increase in summer wildfire smoke and contributed to the flooding of the Yellowstone River (a warmer atmosphere holds more precipitation). At the heart of the case, Lighthiser v. Trump, is the claim that young people are being denied their Fifth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution — life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness — because of the health effects of fossil fuel development and climate change. And they say the Montana Supreme Court’s decision in December to uphold their right to a clean and healthful environment buttresses their claim.

Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a Republican, along with 18 other states and Guam, a U.S. territory, have sided with the Trump administration, filing a motion supporting the government’s request to dismiss the case. They argue the plaintiffs do not have standing to file the lawsuit, and that there is no constitutional right to a specific energy policy. “The state of Montana has an interest in this case because it will directly impact the business done in the energy sector within its borders,” Knudsen argued in his motion.
A hearing on the motion to dismiss, as well as the plaintiffs’ call for a stay of the executive orders, is scheduled this week in federal court in Missoula.
Olivia Vesovich, 21, one of the plaintiffs, who is in her senior year at the University of Montana in Missoula, told KFF Health News she struggles with severe spring pollen allergies, which research shows are exacerbated by climate warming and will likely worsen.
“My eyes were swollen shut every single day, every single night,” Vesovich said. “When I wake up in the morning, I couldn’t open my eyes for 10 minutes. It’s not fun at all, and it’s exacerbated by climate change and by the fossil fuel industry.”
She also has exercise-induced asthma as well as feelings of suffocation from the smoke-filled skies during wildfire season — the intensity and frequency of which are magnified by climate change. And Trump’s executive orders are already being implemented and causing harm, Vesovich said.
“We are making an argument that Olivia’s state constitutional right to a safe climate system should also be protected under the federal Fifth Amendment as part of her liberty right,” said Andrea Rodgers, a senior attorney for Our Children’s Trust.
Our Children’s Trust was also behind the climate change case Juliana v. the United States, filed in 2015 by 21 young plaintiffs who argued their rights had been violated. In 2024, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the federal district court to dismiss the case, ruling that the courts were not the appropriate venue for climate policy.
They believe the victory in Held v. Montana gives American youth more standing this time. If they prevail, the result would be more far-reaching than the Montana case, creating a national precedent.

The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare Trump’s three related executive orders — “Unleashing American Energy,” “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” and “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” — unconstitutional and to block their implementation. They also claim that Trump has overstepped his authority by attempting to undo laws such as the Clean Air Act. A coalition of 14 states’ attorneys general has also filed a lawsuit against the order that declares an energy emergency.
Trump came into office in January primed to support traditional energy sources and to back off efforts to usher in an era of renewable energy, which he claims are not viable. He has also issued orders rolling back environmental regulations. “We are driving a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down the cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S., and more,” Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a March news release.
In July, the EPA proposed repealing its 2009 “endangerment finding” that concluded climate-warming gases “endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.”
The finding established that greenhouse gases are a pollutant and create adverse effects, such as extreme weather and risks to human health and ecosystems. And it created a foundation to regulate automobiles and the energy sector to address climate change.
Zeldin said that eliminating the rule would save Americans “$1 trillion or more in hidden taxes.”
Unleashing fossil fuels will come with costs, as well. The health effects of a warming world are thoroughly established in scientific literature, said Kristie Ebi, a University of Washington professor of global health and an expert in the health risks of climate variability. Mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and malaria are spreading, and flooding, droughts, and wildfire, exacerbated by climate change, pose threats. And research has shown an increase in deaths.
“There’s a long list of adverse health outcomes” from a warming world, she said. “The data are clear.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3666-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-15 19:57:32.605163

Officials are considering a total for the deal that could reach nearly $400 million, sources said.

State Comptroller Sean Scanlon and Lamont’s chief of staff Matthew Brokman were among those in attendance, as well as UConn Health CEO Andrew Agwunobi and UConn Health Board Chair John Driscoll. 
Rob Blanchard, Lamont’s spokesperson, said in a statement, “Although discussions are ongoing, it’s premature to discuss final bids or plans around those partnerships.” He added that the governor wants to support UConn Health’s academic and research programs, while ensuring its sustainability.
Representatives for UConn Health could not be immediately reached for comment. Leadership with Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals deferred to UConn Health for comment. A representative for Waterbury Hospital didn’t provide comment in time for publication Monday.
UConn Health Center, which houses UConn’s medical and dental schools as well as John Dempsey Hospital, has been struggling financially for years, though much of that problem involves fringe benefit and wage costs — driven largely by state government and not by the university itself. 
The health center receives about 13% of its funding from the state budget. The bulk of the rest comes from revenue generated by John Dempsey Hospital.
A report released last year, commissioned by the governor and completed by investment banking firm Cain Brothers, found that the health center had too small of a footprint to compete with other academic medical centers in the current market. The health center generated cash flow losses averaging $140 million per year between 2020 and 2023, the consultants wrote.
The report proposed two solutions: either sell John Dempsey Hospital or engage in a partnership with another health system. 
Scanlon said Monday that the potential deal now being considered could bring financial stability to the state health center and benefit the communities surrounding Waterbury, Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals.
“The potential partnerships that are being explored are about two things: strengthening UConn’s long-term fiscal health and making sure that different communities in Connecticut have access to public health and health care,” Scanlon said. 
Waterbury Hospital is one of three facilities in Connecticut owned by bankrupt hospital operator Prospect Medical Holdings. The formerly private equity-backed Prospect, which also owned hospitals in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and California, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January. 
Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals — Waterbury, Rockville General and Manchester Memorial — have faced longstanding financial and operational problems, including a cyberattack in August 2023. 
“There needed to be a public health solution,” Scanlon said in reference to Waterbury Hospital. “And that is what this is.” (Rockville General and Manchester Memorial aren’t part of the proposed acquisition by UConn Health.)
As part of the proposed deal, the state would not only have to purchase Waterbury Hospital but also the land, buildings and equipment from a real estate investment trust, sources said. Prospect acquired Waterbury Hospital in 2016 and then sold those assets to the REIT in 2018.
Connecticut claims Prospect owes it more than $67 million in health provider taxes, also known as hospital user fees, which hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers must pay to the state every year based on their revenues. It has filed a claim in Prospect’s bankruptcy proceeding to recoup the money. Sources said the tax issue is not part of the proposed hospital deal.
On Monday, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, confirmed the nature of the discussions and said the state is considering borrowing money — bonding — to pay for the hospitals. The state’s goal, Ritter said, is to prevent the hospitals from being acquired by private equity interests. 
Ritter added that he had “specific concerns” about how the state would pay for the hospitals. “UConn Health is not in a position to be taking on more debt so my question is, ‘Who is going to pay for it?’” Ritter said. 
But he indicated he wasn’t opposed to using bonded funds to make the acquisition. “I think if we feel that it’s important to have strong hospitals and to keep these hospitals from being purchased by another private equity company then it’s fine for the state to bond it,” Ritter said.
Ritter said the other issue is whether the state would have to exceed its constitutional spending cap to make the purchases. He also said that question may need to be put to lawmakers in a special session.
The deal would need to be approved by the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees, which holds its next regular meeting on Wednesday. A source said the possible deal will be discussed at that meeting.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) With a little over two weeks before New Mexico lawmakers will convene in Santa Fe for a special legislative session to respond to anticipated federal spending cuts, Republican leaders are calling on the governor to consult with them on the agenda and consider a host of other issues they’d like to address instead.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued a news release earlier this month announcing the Oct. 1 start date of the session along with a few actions the Legislature would likely consider to make up for federal cuts to rural hospitals, Medicaid, food stamps and public broadcasting. It also said she was in “discussions” with the Legislature to address behavioral health and criminal justice issues. 
But Republican leaders in the House and Senate said in a letter Monday that they have not been consulted on any of the specifics about the session, and that Democrats’ fears of federal cuts are unwarranted this early. 
“Republican legislators should be given the same courtesy and opportunity to thoroughly review the fiscal impact and programmatic requirements associated with these proposals,” according to the letter. “This review is particularly necessitated because your public statements have, unfortunately, left the impression that New Mexicans will immediately lose Medicaid and SNAP benefits. Needless to say, nothing could be further from the truth.”

The letter goes on to state changes in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed July 4 are “highly complex” and won’t go into effect for more than a year or longer. 
The letter’s authors said the Legislature should direct more immediate consideration to other issues in the state, including, crime, the state’s child welfare department, medical malpractice reform  and homelessness, according to the letter.
They urged her to issue a proclamation for the session that enables lawmakers to consider all of those topics. 
“The people of New Mexico are convinced these are the real emergencies facing our state and we ask for your leadership in helping provide the Legislature with the opportunity to work in a bipartisan basis to adopt long overdue solutions to these most pressing problems,” according to the letter.  
Jodi McGinnis-Porter, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, told Source New Mexico on Monday afternoon that her office “just got the letter” and so did not have an immediate response.

She is shown with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham during the policy's announcement on Sept. 8, 2025. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)In order to provide free child care to all families in New Mexico, the state will need to amend three rules that govern child care assistance benefits, facility licensing and independent caregivers.
New Mexico’s Early Childhood Education and Care Department will hold an in-person and Zoom hearing on the proposed changes on Oct. 9 and take written public comment through that day as well. The swift rulemaking follows Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s announcement last week that the state will provide universal free child care starting Nov. 1.

The department said in a Sept. 10 announcement that the proposed changes include eliminating income eligibility requirements for all families; making child care hours for families no longer tied to work hours or class schedules; making grandparents raising their grandchildren and CARA families eligible, whether or not they are working or attending school; presumptive eligibility for immediate assistance for three months while families gather the required documentation; and extended eligibility when additional children join households.
The Early Ed Coalition, a group of 15 organizations representing early childhood educators and advocates, on Sept. 10 praised the governor’s announcement of universal child care as a historic win resulting from years of organizing by their member organizations and others.
“By removing income limits and copays, the ECECD is removing a significant barrier for many families in accessing high-quality child care,” the Early Ed Coalition said in a statement. “This, in turn, will enable parents to work, pursue education, or start new careers without the burden of exorbitant child care costs.”
The coalition includes OLÉ NM, Partnership for Community Action, NM Voices for Children, Ngage NM, Save the Children Action Network, CommonSpirit St. Joseph’s Children, NM Asian Family Center, Southwest Women’s Law Center, NM Immigrant Law Center, NM Center on Law and Poverty, El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos, Semilla Action, NM Dream Team, Somos un Pueblo Unido and the Center for Civic Policy.

Other proposed changes include: provider rate increases; requiring providers to participate in the department’s education, training and certification database; requiring providers to comply with all state and federal laws regarding children with disabilities; and no longer requiring registered homes to participate in the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program.
The formal rulemaking notice in English and Spanish, along with copies of the three proposed rules, can be found here.
The Early Ed Coalition statement said while they’re “thrilled” about the progress made, there is more work to be done.
“While there are still barriers to access, particularly for immigrant and refugee families and those in rural and tribal communities, this announcement brings us closer to universality, and we will continue working to ensure that every child and family in New Mexico is supported,” they said.

Regulators are investigating a spill at a different oil well site in Mountrail County, North Dakota. (Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A pipeline leak in northwest North Dakota has spilled an estimated 20,000 barrels, or 840,000 gallons, of crude oil and produced water onto agricultural land, the Department of Environmental Quality said Monday. 
The spill about 4 miles northwest of Stanley in Mountrail County involved emulsion, a mixture of crude oil and produced water that emerges from a well before they are separated, the department said. Produced water, also known as saltwater or brine, is a waste byproduct of oil production. 
The contamination flowed for 250 yards before it was contained by the construction of a clay berm, according to the incident report. 
It is unknown how long the leak went undetected by Hess Corp., which owns the pipeline. Bill Suess, manager of the Department of Environmental Quality’s spill investigation program, said  the company first became aware of a potential problem Sept. 2 when they “started getting an indication their numbers weren’t right” – 10 days before the spill was discovered and reported.
“They went in and did some tests. The tests came back negative,” said Suess. “And then on the 12th they found the dead vegetation.”
Hess discovered and reported the spill on Friday, according to the incident report. 
The cause of the spill has not been identified beyond “equipment failure” and remains under investigation, according to Suess.
The leak occurred from a 6-inch carbon steel pipeline called a “flow line,” used to transport the oil, natural gas and produced water from a well to a treater unit where the products are  separated. Regulators are still investigating the extent of the spill underground, including possible groundwater impacts, Suess said. 
There is no risk to drinking water, Suess said. The department said no water resources have been impacted at this time. 
“We don’t know yet how deep the impacts go,” said Suess. 
Cleanup is expected to last until at least mid-November, according to the incident report. That’s an “optimistic” estimate from Hess, Suess said. 
“This is a big one,” Suess said. 
A Hess representative said the flow line has been isolated and the surface impact was contained to a field between two oil well pads. Hess notified the Department of Environmental Quality and mobilized a third-party environmental contractor, the representative said.
“Safety and the protection of people and the environment are our top priorities,” the Hess representative said in a statement.

Nevada filed a final Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) proposal to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the governor’s office announced Monday.
Nevada had been one of the earliest states to file its final plan, a $416 million version of which had won approval from the Biden administration in January. In June, the Trump administration rescinded approval of Nevada’s plan, along the plans from Louisiana and Delaware, which had also received early approval. At the same time, the Trump administration issued new guidance for spending the federal funding, ordering states to focus more on satellite providers and less on fiber optics, and to spend less overall.
The final plan submitted for NTIA approval will “connect every unserved and underserved location in the state using the most effective mix of technologies, including fiber-optic, hybrid-fiber-coax, licensed fixed wireless, and satellite broadband, ensuring no community is left behind,” the statement from the governor’s office said. 
The funding approval request announced Monday follows $275 million in federal funding that had already been approved for earlier phases of the overall effort to get high-speed broadband to Nevadans without access.
Federal funding for all phases of the effort to build out broadband in Nevada was provided by two pieces of landmark Biden-era legislation, the American Rescue Plan Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

FEMA has not issued that notice for the Shelter and Services Program. FEMA programs provide food, shelterGAO wrote in the 22-page report the delay in the Emergency Food and Shelter Program notice of funding opportunity “constitutes an impermissible withholding and a violation of the ICA.”   The Trump administration’s actions regarding the Shelter and Services Program “establish the intent to impermissibly defer or preclude the obligation of budget authority,” according to the report. The Emergency Food and Shelter Program “supplements and expands ongoing work of local nonprofit and governmental social service organizations to provide shelter, food and supportive services to individuals and families who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, hunger and/or homelessness,” according to FEMA’s website. The Shelter and Services Program is designed to provide temporary housing to relieve overcrowding in federal immigration facilities. Congressional powersGAO also sought to reinforce the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution in the report, explaining that Congress approves laws and that once the president signs those laws, it’s up to that branch of government to implement them. “This process does not grant the President the authority to pass his own laws or to ignore or amend a law duly enacted by Congress. Instead, the President must ‘faithfully execute’ the law as Congress enacts it,” the GAO report states. “It follows from this that Executive Orders cannot function to repeal or undo legislation.”Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement the latest GAO report “is another stark reminder of a fact we have known for months: President Trump is breaking the law in order to prevent communities across the country from receiving resources they have been promised, including critical funding to address homelessness. “The same guy who says he wants to get people off the streets is blocking funding for communities to tackle homelessness.

It’s an interesting fact that while North Carolina’s population continues to steadily increase, enrollment in public schools is trending in the opposite direction. Part of the explanation for this is to be found in demographic shifts, but as Newsline learned in a recent conversation with veteran education policy analyst Kris Nordstrom of the North Carolina Justice Center, there are other factors involved as well – things like the state legislature’s ongoing expansion of private school options and its failure to adequately fund traditional public schools.
Nordstrom has authored a new report on this subject – it’s entitled “Navigating Declining Enrollment: How smarter state policies can help schools thrive” – and in it, he details some of the policy changes that could help slow or reverse the trend, as well as steps state and local officials could take to lessen the negative impacts when they’re forced to close schools.

(Photo by Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg Creative-Getty Images)Summit Carbon Solutions, the company proposing to build more than 1,000 miles of carbon sequestration pipeline through Iowa, announced Monday a community and landownership partnership program and updated commitments.
The partnership focuses on safety precautions, operational transparency and increased benefits to landowners and counties where the pipeline route is slated to be built. 
The letters were sent to county supervisors and county emergency managers Monday, but a Summit representative said they should be sent to all Iowa landowners over the next week and a half. 
“These commitments are more than words on paper—they are a promise to operate safely, openly, and in a way that brings meaningful benefits to the people and places that make this project possible,” the letter, signed by Summit’s new CEO Joe Griffin, said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter outlines seven commitments to landowners and counties, as well as an explanation of how the project adheres to and “often exceeds” federal pipeline safety standards set by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA. 
Safety commitments 
As part of its approach to safety, Summit said it would: establish a constantly staffed control room, maintain an emergency manual, coordinate emergency response plans with local crews, ensure the proper tools and equipment are ready when needed, provide CO2 specific training for responders, ensure immediate notification in the event of an incident and offer a public awareness program at least annually. 
Landowners opposed to the pipeline have noted safety as a primary concern, especially when noting the outcomes of a CO2 pipeline rupture in Satartia, Mississippi several years ago. The Mississippi incident left impacted residents stranded as the excess carbon dioxide in the air immobilized vehicles. 
Additionally, Summit said it would offer annual grants to communities so they can purchase safety and response equipment, and operate a real-time notification system. 
“We’re fully committed to making this project work the right way going forward,” the letter said. “We also realize our significant investment will only be successful if it’s built on genuine partnership, and we know that success depends on working side-by-side with communities and landowners along our route.” 
Emergency response and communication were also part of the seven commitments Summit listed as part of the community partnership program. 
In a bullet labeled “Emergency Response and Preparedness” Summit said it would offer an initial donation of $50,000 to each county emergency management team where the pipeline crosses, plus an additional $1,000 for each mile of pipeline in the county. These funds, which the letter said will be available at least 180 days prior to the start of operations, will help facilitate the training, equipment and notification systems noted previously. 
The second commitment point in the letter concerns public awareness and communications. Here Summit commits to maintaining an updated project website prior to construction and to providing public awareness updates at least annually during construction and operation of the pipeline. 
Commitments to landowners
Summit directed a number of commitments at landowners, who should receive the letters in the mail. 
Some landowners have voiced concerns, and sued, over the surveying process required for Summit to plan its route and assess a property through which the pipeline would travel. In the letter, Summit said it would give landowners at least 72 hours notice, unless there is a different statutory regulation, and offer landowners a one-time $500 payment for project surveys. 
Summit also committed to “avoid the use of eminent domain except as a last resort.” This follows commitments to negotiate in good faith, and to engage in discussions “aimed at reaching mutual agreement.” 
Summit also sent landowners a hotline number they can call in the event they encounter “individuals who do not represent this project with honesty and integrity.”
Landowners can also choose between fair market compensation as either a lump sum, or annual payment, or they can choose a payment option “linked to all financial distributions to Summit’s current owners.” 
“This allows landowners to share in the project’s success in a way similar to investors, but without actually owning part of the company,” the letter explained. 
Regardless of which reimbursement option they choose, landowners with a voluntary easement will receive an annual stakeholder payment at a rate of at least $0.25 per foot of pipeline on their property. The rate will increase as Summit acquires higher percentages of voluntary easements along the project footprint in the state. If 100% of voluntary easements are reached, the stakeholder payment rate will be $0.50 per foot per year. 
“This way, every landowner benefits more when we achieve this milestone together, reflecting our belief that shared commitment should result in shared success,” the letter said. 
Counties along the pipeline route will be eligible for an annual grant of $0.125 per foot of Summit pipeline in the county. These grants go directly to the counties and can be spent on things like emergency response, agriculture and ethanol production, trainings or healthy families and communities. According to the letter, the grants and landowner stakeholder payments will persist annually through the lifetime of the pipeline project. 
The county grant rate will also increase as voluntary easements are reached throughout the county, with a cap at $0.25 per foot if voluntary easements are established for 100% of the path through the county.
Summit also committed to prioritize union and local laborers for project construction and to prequalify contractors based on safety and insurance coverage. 
The letter said it would commit to building “strong, respectful, and lasting relationships” with tribal nations along the route, which also passes through parts of Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. 
According to the company, the community and landowner partnership agreement is rolling out in Iowa first. 
Finally, Summit said it was committed to water stewardship and transparency throughout the project. In this section of the letter, Summit said it commits to “innovative” design and operation of its system to “enhance” water efficiency. 
“We commit to partnering with each ethanol facility to ensure water is sourced, permitted, efficiently used, and discharged responsibly, with a focus on minimization, recycling, and reuse where appropriate,” Summit said in the letter, which was signed by leadership from more than a dozen partnering ethanol plants.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appointed U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman alongside four other GOP members and three Democrats on Thursday, according to the Congressional record. 
Hageman’s appointment is notable as she defeated Wyoming’s former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, who broke from the Republican party in voting to impeach President Donald Trump for his role in the insurrection. 
Cheney also served as vice chair of the original Jan. 6 committee, which interviewed over a thousand people, held a series of televised hearings and reviewed over a million documents before publishing an 814-page report in 2022. Her decision to participate in the panel — she ultimately was one of its most high-profile members — angered many Republicans in Wyoming and elsewhere. Trump even traveled to Casper for a rally focused on supporting Hageman in her 2022 race against Cheney.
Ultimately, the committee found enough evidence to convict Trump and recommended several charges to the Department of Justice. A grand jury indicted Trump in 2023, but charges were dismissed in November after Trump won the presidential election. 
Earlier this month, the House voted to officially establish the new committee via a resolution. 
“The resolution authorizes and directs the select subcommittee to conduct a full and complete investigation and study and issue a final report of the events surrounding January 6, 2021,” the resolution states. 
The resolution authorizes its chair, Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk, “to receive information available to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; to extend certain periods for questioning witnesses; and to use depositions, subpoenas, and interrogatories to collect information.”
Loudermilk told Politico there was “more politics than there was truth” in the original report. House Democrats have argued the new panel is a distraction. 
Maryland Democratic Rep. Jayme Raskin, who served on the original committee, will act as an ex officio member of the new panel.
Raskin said the new committee will provide the opportunity “to examine the constantly growing criminal records of all the hundreds of violent felons, cop-beaters and white nationalists who Donald Trump pardoned and released onto our streets in his first day in office,” in a press release. 
About 140 Capitol Police officers were injured on Jan. 6, making it one of the most violent days for law enforcement in recent American history. A western Wyoming man was convicted in July 2024 of assaulting officers during the Jan. 6 riot.
Hageman, for her part, has downplayed Jan. 6 and sought to relieve Trump of any blame for the attacks. 
Last year, for example, she co-sponsored a resolution “expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that former President Trump did not engage in insurrection or rebellion against, nor give aid or comfort to the enemies of the United States.”
She also signed an amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse a lower court’s use of a certain statute in deciding the prison sentences for Jan. 6 rioters. 
The committee’s final report must be completed by the end of 2026.

(Photo provided by Washington State Courts)When G. Helen Whitener arrived in this country at age 16 from Trinidad and Tobago, she did so in a wheelchair. 
The right side of Whitener’s body had become paralyzed. She learned it was from a hereditary degenerative back condition that has followed her for the rest of her life.
But with treatment, Whitener, appointed to the Washington state Supreme Court in 2020, hid her disability for years. She felt she already dealt with enough being a Black immigrant woman who was a member of the LGBTQ+ community.
“Just adding that additional one, disability, I knew it would literally prohibit me from being all that I can be,” Whitener said in an interview Friday. 
She would use a cane, but play it off as a minor injury when asked. She only opened up about her condition after joining the Pierce County Superior Court after years as a prosecutor and defense attorney. 
Whitener was assigned to a courtroom with steps, and she stumbled. When she disclosed her disability, she learned only one courtroom was considered accessible.
This experience led Whitener, now 60, to help lead the Supreme Court’s Disability Justice Task Force. The task force’s work recently culminated in a more than 600-page study on conditions for people with disabilities in Washington’s legal system. The report found “widespread physical, programmatic, and cultural barriers that hindered in-person and virtual court engagement.”
Last week, the findings were presented to the Supreme Court in a daylong symposium. 
Chief Justice Debra Stephens noted this was the first study of its kind in the nation. 
“We strive as a judiciary to deliver equal justice, but we can’t deliver anything unless we receive,” Stephens said. “We are here to receive, to listen and learn, because achieving justice starts with better understanding, from the perspective of people who work within our systems,  the barriers that they face.”
To Whitener, the symposium “meant everything to me with my ascension to this court.”
The findings
The task force grew out of conversations between Whitener and Robert Lichtenberg, who has since retired from the state’s Administrative Office of the Courts. 
But as Whitener developed the task force, a long-awaited reconstructive back surgery stemming from her disability put her out of work for months in 2023. Whitener only took up driving again this year. And she now has fitted chairs she can use at the Temple of Justice that allow her to sit for long periods despite her disability.
The task force’s work moves beyond courts complying with federal requirements in the Americans with Disabilities Act. Instead, Whitener said, it’s about “accepting people with disabilities, meeting them where they are at instead of having them to tell us what they need.”
In the study, conducted by KMG Consulting, court employees reported a lack of accessibility training. Court users with disabilities reported wide dissatisfaction for reasons that go beyond physical accessibility. This includes inaccessible paperwork, technological issues and poor treatment from court staff. 
Court staff and administrators also don’t understand their requirements under the state court system’s General Rule 33, which governs access for people with disabilities. And people with disabilities largely don’t know how to request accommodations under the rule. 
Buildings and evacuation routes are often unsafe for people with disabilities, the study found. One example that stuck out to Whitener was a courthouse where an emergency exit is a fire escape with an air conditioner in front of it.
Recommendations from the Florida-based consulting group include recurring implicit bias training for judges, a consistent request process for accommodations and a pilot program to provide navigators in courts to help people with disabilities.
Whitener’s co-chair on the task force, King County Superior Court Judge David Whedbee, is a paraplegic after a rock climbing accident. 
“Disability justice must remain a permanent part of how we define access, equity and justice moving forward,” Whedbee said in the symposium. “This work is not finished, it is only just beginning and it will take all of us.”

Whitener wants a commission focused on this issue, similar to minority and justice and language access commissions. She also plans on proposing changes to General Rule 33.
The goal for Whitener is to build a legal system where future generations don’t have to hide.
“It’s not about special treatment,” she said. “It is about being able to be your authentic self.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Justice-G.-Helen-Whitener-1024x701.jpg,,,2025-09-15 18:56:54.330340

The petition, filed on Monday, requests route and pipe-size modifications to add an ethanol plant to the route and to “amend the conditions regarding North Dakota and South Dakota.”
In the IUC’s approval of the CO2 pipeline permit through Iowa, it noted Summit could not begin construction until it had received route and storage permission from North Dakota — where the pipeline is slated to deposit the sequestered carbon in an underground rock formation — and route permission from South Dakota.

South Dakota enacted a law earlier this year to stop the use of eminent domain on carbon sequestration pipelines, and has denied Summit’s permit requests twice. Summit’s permits were approved in North Dakota, but have been tied up in litigation.
In the petition to the IUC, Summit said its request to change the language was not meant to change the “protections against a ‘pipeline to nowhere.'” Summit said this change would reflect that “additional options for storage and pathways to storage are developing and may provide a better solution.”
Summit asked that the state-specific language be removed from the order to instead read:
“Summit Carbon Solutions, LLC, shall not commence construction on any segment of pipe in Iowa until it has secured access to one or more sequestration sites and permits or agreements to allow it to reach such storage … and has filed proof of such approvals with the Commission.”
The other requested changes, according to the petition, would account for ease of building the pipeline around railroads and roads, and to facilitate connections to sequestration sites that have since been added to the project.

(Gov. Tom Wolf/Flickr)Eugene DePasquale, a former member of the state House and two-term state auditor general, was elected to lead Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party for the next year. He will serve out the remainder of state Sen. Sharif Street’s term.
Democratic state committee members gathered in Lancaster for their fall meeting earlier this month to hold the special election. Street served as the party chair since 2022, but announced he would step down to focus on his campaign for Congress.
DePasquale is now at the helm after the Democratic Party suffered losses up and down the ballot in the commonwealth in 2024, including his own defeat in the race for state attorney general, and as Republicans continue to narrow the voter registration gap in the Keystone State.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
He spoke with the Pennsylvania Capital-Star about the challenges he sees facing the state’s Democratic Party, his opinion on Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman’s job performance, and what steps need to be taken to win back voters who have left the party. 
This interview was lightly edited for length and clarity.
Capital-Star: Why did you decide to run for chair of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party?
DePasquale: I think we’ve all got to do our part to step up and help.
I mean, I think that there’s a lot of challenges in our country.
I know as a Democratic Party, I think there’s a lot of things we could be doing better. 
I think I’ve got a background to help that, and I know I’ve got something to offer the public at large, and certainly the Democratic Party.
So, I decided to run, and certainly other party leaders, the governor included, asked me to consider this, and I was happy to do it.
Capital-Star: So, you were elected in a special election to complete state Sen. Sharif Street’s term as party chair. So that term will end next year. Are you planning on seeking a full term as party chair?
DePasquale:  I am. 
Capital-Star: Republicans secured big victories in Pennsylvania in 2024, as you know, with President Donald Trump winning the state’s 19 electoral votes, flipping the Senate seat red with Dave McCormick’s victory over Bob Casey, flipping two congressional seats and winning all the statewide row offices.
You traveled the state last year, and you talked to voters on the campaign trail in your run for attorney general. What do you think happened in 2024?
DePasquale: I think it is very clear that there was a large segment of the electorate that felt that the Democratic Party had lost touch with their concerns, particularly on economic issues. 
There are people that have voted for Democrats in the past that did not vote for us in 2024.
That certainly is going to be a priority for me as party leader moving forward, to try to help win those back.
But that, to me, is clearly what happened.
Capital-Star: How would you describe the current state of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party?
DePasquale: I think Chairman Street did a great job.
I think there were some other headwinds that were beyond his control, namely inflation and some of the issues with President Biden deciding to drop out. Some of the circumstances there that were obviously a challenge for us as a party at the ballot box in 2024, but under his watch, we elected a Democratic governor and flipped the House Democratic.
So, there were some successes under his tenure, but we certainly have our challenges moving forward as what was exposed in the 2024 election.
Capital-Star: So what do you view as the biggest challenges currently facing the Pennsylvania Democratic Party?
DePasquale: It’s making sure we win those voters back.
Capital-Star: And how do you win those voters back?
DePasquale: Listening to them and putting real, concrete ideas on the table to address their concerns, and those are mostly pocketbook, economic issues.
And as we see now, there is an opening because the Trump administration has failed them.
When you look at inflation still being a problem and this tariff chaos, when you look at the package that was passed by all Republicans in D.C. that is now going to be ripping health care and food security out of the hands of millions of vulnerable Pennsylvanians, and when you see a tax code now that further favors the ultra rich and corporations at the expense of average everyday Americans, I think people are now frustrated with President Trump and feel let down, but we’ve got to show that we hear them as well, and we’re going to address their concerns if we’re put back into power.
Capital-Star: Although Democrats still hold a voter registration advantage in Pennsylvania, Republicans have significantly cut into that in recent years. What do you think has happened that has led to the Democratic Party’s massive voter registration advantage being significantly narrowed?
DePasquale: So, there’s a couple things.
First of all, it’s very clear that the party didn’t have enough emphasis on actually registering people as Democrats. That’s number one.
Number two, it’s clear that a very big chunk of Pennsylvanians, and you’re seeing this issue across the country, have lost faith with both parties, which leads to the third point, the largest voting share increase in the state, is actually not affiliated.
So, I know the Republicans have put more emphasis on this than we have.
Under my leadership, we’re going to change that.
But there’s also, for lack of a better phrase, a brand issue, that we’ve got to show the people that are frustrated with both parties that we’re the ones fighting for them.
Capital-Star: It’s an interesting point you bring up how unaffiliated voters have been gaining momentum in the state. Like you said, the numbers show that there are more people registering unaffiliated or independent.
On that note, over the summer, a King’s Bench petition was filed to the state Supreme Court in an effort to have open primary elections in Pennsylvania.
Do you think Pennsylvania should have open primary elections? And if there were open primaries, what kind of impact do you think that would have on elections in the state?
DePasquale: Look, this is not an official statement, on behalf of the party, but for myself, when I was a legislator, I introduced an open primary bill.
So, I have long believed this.
I believe in empowering more voters.
Now, again, that’s not an official party position, but that’s something I support.
And I do think that if you allow non-affiliated voters to vote in the primary, it would force candidates in both parties to speak to a broader swath of the electorate.
Capital-Star: Another task that you have as the state party chair is fundraising. Can you talk about what kind of emphasis you’re going to have on that as state party chair, and what do you think, you could be doing differently in that space, as opposed to the previous administration?
DePasquale: Well, I don’t want to get into what the previous administration did.
I know Sharif had some challenges running for Congress and doing this at the same time, but I do know we’ve had a good first week out of the shoot.
But, look all the things you want to do, television ads, mailers, name the list, hire staff, organize regions: that stuff all costs money.
You got to raise money to do it.
So, I’ve got to do my job to outreach the people that are committed to the party, show them a plan and then get them to invest in it.
And like I said, the first week, we’ve had some pretty good success.
Capital-Star: I asked a similar question to Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Greg Rothman, when I interviewed him earlier this year. So, I want to ask you essentially the same thing: Do you think the governing approach for Democrats in Pennsylvania should be towards a purple state, or should they treat Pennsylvania as a blue state?
DePasquale: Well, I think you should always do what you believe is right and then make the case to the public as to why it’s right.
Capital-Star: You sort of touched on this earlier in the interview, but what are the issues that you believe Democrats should address to earn back the trust of voters that maybe have left the party in recent years?
DePasquale: We’ve got to do a better job of listening.
Then we’ve got to do a better job of putting ideas on the table to address their concerns, and then you got to deliver once you’re given power again.
Capital-Star: I was watching the Phillies game last night (Wednesday night) and noticed an ad promoting the three Supreme Court justices, who were elected as Democrats in 2015, and they’re seeking retention in 2025. What kind of investment is the party making for those 2025 retention races, and how important are those judicial races?
DePasquale: That is the top priority of the party between now and November, priority, full stop.
There are other local races that certainly matter, and the judicial election statewide certainly matter, but the top priority is all of it: retention, Supreme Court, Commonwealth Court, Superior Court.
Capital-Star: What kind of investment is the state party going to make, do you think, in those races?
DePasquale: We will spend what we raise to make sure that happens.
Capital-Star: Then after November, of course, 2026 is around the corner. I know as party chair, your goal is to compete in every corner of the commonwealth. But what do you view as the top priorities in next year’s elections? What are the particular races that you think are must wins, or the highest priorities that you would view as the biggest victory, should you flip some seats as well? What are those races?
DePasquale: Certainly re-electing the governor and the lieutenant governor, holding the state House, hoping to flip the state Senate, and then competing in all the congressional districts.
But particularly, we know that there we’re going to be a battleground in at least four or five of them, and if we win the majority of those, we are going to be the reason why Democrats control the U.S. House of Representatives.
Capital-Star: Can you expand upon which specific congressional seats? You mentioned those four or five?
DePasquale: You’ve got the Philadelphia suburbs, you’ve got PA-10 (Republican incumbent Scott Perry’s district). You’ve got the Lehigh Valley, Northeast Pennsylvania, and certainly retaining all of our Democratic incumbents, as well.
Capital-Star: You already mentioned Gov. Josh Shapiro is seeking a second term as governor. What do you think the message should be from his campaign next year?
DePasquale: Well, I think he’s had a great record.
I think Pennsylvania has moved forward under his leadership.
I think from whether it was the I-95 collapse to greater investments in education, I think he’s made it easier and simpler for people to own businesses in Pennsylvania, tax relief for seniors. There’s been real tax relief. I believe those are all going to be on the campaign trail pushing forward. I think he will win and win in convincing fashion.
Capital-Star: Somewhat shifting gears here, but this is still a relevant conversation that, actually, I asked Governor Shapiro about at a press conference about a month ago. Some states, blue and red, are currently in the process of redrawing their congressional maps before the 2026 election. Do you think Pennsylvania should consider drawing new congressional boundaries before the next midterm election?
DePasquale: I mean, one of the things about being a divided state with the Republicans in the Senate, the Democrats in the House, I just don’t see that being even remotely close to realistic.
Capital-Star: I noticed U.S. Senator John Fetterman announced that he was supporting your bid for party chair.
However, I think it’s fair to say U.S. Senator John Fetterman has caused controversy within the Democratic Party since the beginning of Trump’s second term for a few positions he’s taken, with some in the party, including Cumberland County Democratic Party Chairman Matt Roan calling on him to resign. What have you made of Senator John Fetterman’s job performance?
DePasquale: Look, I believe the senator is fighting for what he believes in and what he campaigned on, and he’s a loyal Democrat, and he’s offered to help support the party, and we appreciate that, and I’m hopeful to continue that working relationship moving forward.
Capital-Star: We’ve seen in recent months, poll after poll at the national level signals that the Democratic Party’s approval rating is the lowest it’s been in decades. Why do you think the Democratic Party is unpopular nationwide? This is not a Pennsylvania-centric issue, but what do you think the party as a whole, nationwide, outside of your role, needs to do to win those voters back? And why is that happening?
DePasquale: Part of it was a loss of focus on us talking about economic issues.
The second part is, I think that stems from actual registered Democrats being frustrated… not seeing the party fighting back enough against the extremism of the Trump administration.
I think you’ve got to do both, not only push back against President Trump, especially on the economy and these oversteps of his authority, but also make sure you’re reconnecting with voters.
We’ve got to do both.
Capital-Star: What are the long term goals for Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party that you would like to accomplish while you’re at the helm?
DePasquale: I want to make sure that we have a Democratic Party that’s fighting for all of Pennsylvania, and that we are winning more elections and making sure that Pennsylvania is a better place to live, work and raise a family.
That’s the ultimate goal of what the Democratic Party is and what the goal of winning elections needs to be.

Roberts, R-Burlington, is calling for the firing of a university employee in Louisville. (Photo provided by Rep. T.J. Roberts)A Kentucky Republican lawmaker is criticizing a University of Louisville employee for a Facebook post she made after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was gunned down last week while speaking at a college in Utah. 
State Rep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, voiced the criticism in response to a post on X by LibsofTikTok, a right-wing social media account that has millions of followers and has targeted numerous online commenters for what it says are disrespectful and objectionable statements in the wake of Kirk’s death.
Kirk, 31, died Wednesday after he was shot at an event at Utah Valley University. A suspect is in custody. 
According to a screenshot in Roberts’ post, Alex Muckler, the assistant director of admissions for UofL’s Brandeis School of Law, shared a 2023 quote from Kirk about gun violence deaths being “worth it” to protect Second Amendment rights. Muckler introduced her Facebook post by writing,“Presented without comment.”
UofL spokesperson John Karman told the Lantern in an email that the university is reviewing  the comments and added that Muckler is not on leave from her position. Muckler declined to comment for this story. 
“We have received feedback from both elected officials and members of the community,” Karman said. 
Roberts said Muckler’s post took Kirk’s original comments out of context and that they were presented “while his body is still warm.” 
“This comment in itself is an effort to minimize an assassination that took place on American soil,” Roberts said. 
“I think Muckler should be terminated from employment,” Roberts said. “I don’t think that people in our institutions that can determine whether you are admitted or not to your education for your career, should be in that position if they’re celebrating the murder of someone that thousands of UofL students look up to — and that’s both sides by the way.” 
Roberts’ original X post about Muckler was in response to a post from LibsofTikTok about a University of Kentucky employee. 
Another Republican lawmaker, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, of Smithfield, replied on X to Roberts’ post that Muckler “needs to be fired immediately.” 
LibsofTikTok shared a post by Bradley Van Hook, a UK employee who is now on leave for a comment he made on a WKYT article about Kirk’s death. Van Hook had paraphrased a quote from attorney Clarence Darrow, who died in 1938, writing, “I have never wished a man dead, but I have read some obituaries with great satisfaction.” LibsofTikTok initially misidentified Van Hook as an employee of Eastern Kentucky University. 
UK spokesperson Jay Blanton said  that Van Hook, who manages the university’s key shop, is on administrative leave with pay, pending an investigation.
“The statement attributed to him — no matter who made it and what their affiliation is — does not reflect who we are as a community. It is cruel. It is insensitive and it is wrong,” Blanton said in a statement. “I should also add that whenever we receive a complaint about alleged or potential employee misconduct, we conduct a review or investigation. That is our protocol. We are proceeding in accordance with that process.”

Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, was a polarizing figure who regularly travelled to universities to host viewpoint debates with college students. He hosted such events at UK in recent years. Turning Point USA also maintains a searchable “watch list” of professors it accuses of pushing “leftist propaganda” in the classroom.
Workers across the country have been fired or placed on leave because of public remarks about Kirk following his death. Asked about concerns for protected speech under the First Amendment, Roberts said “you have the right to criticize officials, to criticize public figures, to enter into the marketplace of ideas — and that’s exactly what Charlie Kirk did, and he was killed for it.”
Roberts said he wasn’t interested in hearing from the other side of the political aisle about suppression of free speech.  
“I don’t want to hear a word from the actual advocates of cancel culture when it comes to be that employers are not willing to put up with the celebration of assassination and the celebration of violence,” Roberts added. “I think that is a total bait-and-switch, because they’re insisting upon a right that they never guaranteed to the other side.”

Trump said his efforts in the district – using the National Guard – would be replicated in cities across the country.In the Oval Office, flanked by Tennessee’s GOP Gov. Bill Lee and the state’s Republican U.S. senators, Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn, the president signed a presidential memoranda to establish a “Memphis Safe Task Force” to address violent crime using federal law enforcement and agencies. “We're sending in the big force,” Trump said. Multiple federal agenciesIn addition to the National Guard, the task force will include the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. It’s unclear how many Guard members or members of federal law enforcement will be sent. “This task force will be a replica of our extraordinarily successful efforts here, and you'll see it's a lot of the same thing,” Trump said of using the National Guard in the district. It’s the first time Trump has sent the National Guard into a red state, after seizing control of the California National Guard from the state’s governor — a Democrat — for deployment in Los Angeles, and then sending Guard members to the district, another Democratic stronghold. While homicide rates remain high in Memphis compared to the nation, murders overall from 2023 to 2024 have decreased by 14%, according to the most recent data from the Memphis Shelby Crime Commission.The Memphis mayor's office could not immediately be reached for comment. Trump added that St. Louis, Missouri, could also see similar action. Other citiesThe dispatch of the National Guard to Tennessee comes after Trump has threatened to send troops to other cities including New Orleans; Portland, Oregon; and Chicago. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker pushed back and the president had backed off his threat, though he mentioned the city again on Monday. Governors have control over their state National Guard except in rare circumstances where the president can seize control. Pritzker has repeatedly rejected the idea of sending the National Guard into Chicago.“If we don’t have the governor's help we’re doing it without him,” Trump said of Pritzker. With Memphis, Lee welcomed the intervention and thanked Trump for directing federal resources to the city. “We are very hopeful and excited about the prospect of moving that city forward,” Lee said.",,,,2025-09-15 18:56:54.330340

Cattle are at little risk of death with proper care, and the herd has been quarantined, officials said. 
Nebraska State Veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley asked the state’s cattle producers to monitor their biosecurity protocols and contact a vet if they notice any symptoms. Dairy cattle experiencing signs of the virus should be reported to NDA at 402-471-2351 or the USDA at 866-536-7593.
The state warned farmers to watch for decreases in hunger and milk production, along with clear nasal discharge, tacky or loose feces, dehydration, fever and lethargic behavior.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said the threat to human health from infected animals remains low, but has said infections are possible from direct contact.

Residents say the tower violates their local zoning rules and would harm the scenic view from state-protected Tinmouth Channel, among other concerns.

Near the serene, scenic landscape along Route 140 and the state-protected Tinmouth Channel wetland, a Massachusetts-based company wants to erect a 160-foot radio tower, drawing local pushback. 
Public comments have poured in to the Public Utility Commission from Tinmouth residents opposing the project proposed by Industrial Tower and Wireless. The comments say the project would violate local zoning and Tinmouth’s town plan, negatively impact wildlife habitat and would interfere with the scenic views, among other qualms. There were no statements of support for the project submitted to the commission before the deadline last Tuesday. 
Tinmouth residents, along with Industrial Tower and Wireless, now await further process determinations by the Public Utility Commission on whether to hold an evidentiary hearing and eventually to approve or deny Industrial Tower and Wireless’ request. 
When Industrial Tower and Wireless proposed the tower in February, Tinmouth Town Clerk Fallar said she told the company to not go forward with the project on the behalf of the town.
“We don’t want this here,” Fallar said. “It doesn’t comply.”
Fallar said the company initially proposed to place the tower in a protected zone solely designated for agriculture and forestry. Industrial Tower and Wireless then moved the planned site across the town’s zoning line in a conservation district where towers are allowed a conditional use, Fallar said. 
But, Fallar said, the current Industrial Tower and Wireless proposal does not meet the conditions for use, as telecommunications towers cannot be built higher than 130 feet, or 20 feet above the average tree height. A 160-foot spire with mounted antennas would stand far above what is allowed by the local zoning regulations, she said. 
Kevin Delaney, a vice president for Industrial Tower and Wireless, wrote in prefiled testimony dated Aug 8 that the project will allow the company’s customers “living in, working in or passing through the Tinmouth area” to use the company network, “something that is impossible at present.” The project would enhance remote work access and be available for colocation of telecommunications technology by other providers, Delaney wrote.

“As such, the project will promote a balanced, diverse economic base, with a focus on locally owned businesses, including home-based ones,” Delaney wrote. “This type of project also brings with it the opportunity to attract the major wireless communications carriers to the area to improve upon their wireless communications networks.”
Burlington attorney for Industrial Tower and Wireless, Cooper Hayes, declined to comment on the ongoing matter. 
Both the local select board and planning commission unanimously voted against supporting the radio tower, Fallar said. On behalf of the town, Fallar submitted an intervention to the Public Utility Commission to become a party to Industrial Tower and Wireless’ Aug. 8 application for a certificate of public good. On Sept. 9, Fallar asked on behalf of the town that the Public Utility Commission deny the request or schedule an evidentiary hearing on the tower company’s request if an initial denial is not possible. 
“We are disappointed that ITW is choosing to ignore the clear written community standards and recommendation to deny this tower which is required by statute to be given substantial deference,” Fallar wrote. “The proposed tower in this location will not promote the general good of the state.”

In March, the Rutland Regional Planning Commission also voiced concern to the Public Utility Commission due the project violating the town plan and the potential impact on the natural resources of the Tinmouth Channel, a state-protected wetland area, according to a letter signed by Board of Commissioners Chair Erika Berner and submitted by Executive Director Devon Neary. 
“Ensuring this project does not adversely affect such an environmentally sensitive area is critical,” Berner wrote. “Local planning efforts are essential to land use decisions, and the Commission believes that the Town’s determination should be given significant weight.”
Annette Smith, executive director of the nonprofit Vermonters for a Clean Environment, said requests for radio and cell towers have cropped up across the state in recent years, including in Manchester, Chelsea and Hardwick, and Vermonters’ resistance to cell towers goes back decades. A proposed radio tower by Industrial Tower and Wireless in Enosburg has been caught up in contentious debate and litigation for several years.

Smith is concerned that once the aesthetics of a site is degraded with a tower “that opens the door to more degradation — you can’t say it’s free of industrial development.”
Smith, of nearby Danby, said she helps local communities navigate the Public Utility Commission’s opaque public participation process and fight radio and cell towers from “cluttering up the landscape.”
Cris Carabeau, a Tinmouth resident who lives near the proposed project, also filed an intervention and request for a hearing to the Public Utility Commission. Cris and her husband Larry, who serves on the local planning commission, said the scenic view of the Tinmouth mountain valley across from their farm has brought joy over the years, and they are worried about the impact of the tower on their property value. 
Carabeau added that the town has sufficient communication signals for law enforcement and emergency services, so she does not think the tower will ultimately serve the public good.
Adam Guettel, another neighbor to the proposed project, voiced concerns over the health impacts of wireless telecommunications technology if the Industrial Tower and Wireless colocates a cell antenna on the radio tower. Guettel said he intervened in the Public Utility Commission so that residents have more access to the decision-making process.
“I feel betrayed that this should be going on so quickly and without our intervention,” Guettel said “We have to slow the process down.”
The “top two issues” Smith hears from residents are the negative impacts on property values and concerns that cell towers cause cancer or other detrimental health effects, yet those are not concerns that the Public Utility Commission considers in their determinations. 
There is not strong evidence that radiofrequency waves cause negative health outcomes, according to the American Cancer Society. But the group also acknowledges that more research is needed to understand long term impacts of new cell technology. 
According to the prefiled testimony of professional engineer and project manager Louis Hodgetts, employed by DuBois & King, the project also expands the range for emergency service calls, and would not have adverse impacts on the conservation area and conforms with the local town plan.

While recognizing the presence of rare species like the long-headed thimbleweed and calcareous red maple, Hodgetts wrote, “the area of proposed disturbance generally lacks high-quality or irreplaceable natural communities.”
Tinmouth Tree Warden, forester and fire department worker David Birdsall said the town does not need additional radio or cell tower services. He is worried about the impact to the view and harm to the rare, threatened and endangered species within the Tinmouth Channel. 
The Tinmouth Channel, a state wildlife management area, contains a large deer wintering area, habitat for migratory birds and the northern long-eared bat, a wetland complex and the state’s biggest open intermediate fen, Birdsall wrote in his comments to the Public Utility Commission.
“There’s very few places in Vermont that are this exquisite,” Birdsall said. “It’s ridiculous to think about putting something like this this close to that gem.”

(Photos of Neronha and Shekarchi by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current; photo of Foulkes by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current; McKee campaign video still)Nearly one year out from the state’s gubernatorial primary, most voters haven’t decided who they will vote for, according to a new University of Rhode Island survey published Monday. 
The third annual Rhode Island Survey Initiative administered by YouGov took the temperature of 500 adults on housing, health care, the Washington Bridge, media consumption and politics. The margin of error was 6.1%
In a hypothetical, four-way primary between Gov. Dan McKee — the only declared candidate at the time of the August survey — and potential challengers Helena Buonanno Foulkes, Attorney General Peter Neronha, and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, McKee maintained a 3.5% lead over no. 2 Neronha.
The most prevalent answer from those surveyed, however? “Not sure” was the response from four in 10 of the 362 registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters who answered the question. 
“The way I read this is that we’re a long way out from the primary, especially in the minds of Rhode Islanders,” Ashlea Rundlett, associate political science professor and director of URI’s master’s program in international relations, said in an interview on Monday. “At the time, they hadn’t really started campaigns.”
That changed Sept. 9, when Foulkes, a former CVS executive who lost to McKee by three percentage points in the 2022 Democratic primary, kicked off her campaign with a splashy event at Roger Williams Park Casino in Providence. 
Rundlett acknowledged that the results of the URI survey, conducted from Aug. 1 to Aug. 18, might look very different if the same question was posed again now that Foulkes has entered the race and McKee has begun campaigning more publicly.
“I expect that even if we were to run this poll next week or the week after, it would change,” she said.
Trading jabs 
Hours before Foulkes made her pitch to a crowd of supporters, McKee’s campaign released a digital ad attacking Foulkes for her role in the opioid crisis. A 2024 federal lawsuit against CVS Health accuses the pharmacy giant of knowingly filling fake prescriptions for opioids over a 10-year period, faulting executives — though not explicitly Foulkes — for putting profits over people’s safety.
Christina Freundlich, a spokesperson for McKee’s campaign, took another indirect jab at Foulkes in her response to the survey results Monday. 
“While Washington Republicans further restrict access to quality health care, Rhode Islanders can’t afford a governor who turned a blind eye to illegal opioid sales to lead the state,’ Freundlich said. “Rhode Island needs a governor like Dan McKee who will fight for a stronger health care system instead of someone who profited off the opioid crisis.”
Freundlich did not identify Foulkes by name.
Foulkes trailed McKee by four percentage points in the survey with 14.3% also just behind Neronha, who received 15% support.
“Helena is working to earn every vote,” Jon Romano, a campaign spokesperson, said in an email. That’s why she’s holding community gatherings in all 39 cities and towns to hear directly from Rhode Islanders about their concerns and ideas.”
While she is identified as “former CVS executive,” in the URI survey, Rundlett also said she did not think the ties to the controversial company hurt Foulkes’ performance in the survey. McKee’s campaign had not yet released its attack ad at the time of the poll.
Rundlett said poll writers had “extensive discussions,” about what title to give Foulkes, the only non-sitting officeholder, and only woman, among the bunch of potential names on the ballot.
“Ultimately, we ended up choosing what we saw most frequently in the media,” she said of Foulkes’ title. “I also felt like it was a title that said what someone accomplished, versus ‘former candidate,’ which doesn’t say much about who they are or where they come from.”
Neronha did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on his inclusion in the poll, or second-place level of support. In an interview last week, the term-limited AG said he was still contemplating a run, but had not made a decision. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi received the smallest level of support among survey takers — just over 7% — despite being the top fundraiser in the state. The Warwick Democrat did not address his potential candidacy Monday, instead touting the state legislation passed under his leadership.
“The poll confirms that Rhode Islanders care deeply about the accessibility and affordability of housing and health care, two issues which the General Assembly has focused on since I have been Speaker,” Shekarchi said in an emailed response. “There is much work to be done, and I remain steadfast in my belief that we can continue to address these challenges by bringing people together.”
To Rundlett, the race remains open, with all four potential competitors falling within the 6.9% margin of error for the survey question.
“I don’t think it says a ton about who has an advantage,” she said of the results. 
Finding disfavor 
Especially because McKee struggles to win over the electorate generally.
Roughly 37% of those surveyed disapprove of the way the governor is handing the top leadership role, down 26 percentage points from the public sentiment when the question was asked a year ago. But, that’s in part because this year’s survey gave participants the option to answer “not sure,” whereas the 2024 survey forced them to choose between approve and disapprove, Rundlett said.
McKee’s 29% approval rating this year is in line with results of a pair of polls released in July — one national and one by the Pell Center at Salve Regina University — both showing one-quarter of voters looked favorably on the governor’s job performance.
The new URI poll also indirectly links McKee’s struggles in the public eye to the ongoing Washington Bridge crisis — more than six in 10 named McKee as one of the people “highly” or “somewhat responsible” for the crisis. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation, and its director, Peter Alviti Jr., faced more blame, named by 77% of survey participants.
Foulkes in her campaign kickoff said the expensive and delayed Washington Bridge rebuild was a “glaring example” of McKee’s broader inability to effectively lead, contrasting the five-year replacement timeline with her giving birth to four children in four-and-a-half years.
Freundlich declined to answer questions on the survey results regarding the governor’s approval rating.

Speaking in Orlando, Ingoglia said the general fund budget for Orange County had increased by more than $559 million — a nearly 54% boost — in that time, as he continues to make the case along with Gov. Ron DeSantis that local government spending is out of control and is the reason why Floridians deserve property tax relief.
“Your local government here is taking the money and spending it and expanding government, creating new programs that probably shouldn’t be paid with your tax dollars, expanding already existing programs that are paid by your tax dollars, and just wasting it willy-nilly,” he said.
Orange County’s current budget sits at $8.2 billion.
County Mayor Jerry Demings fired back, complaining Ingoglia got basic facts wrong and neglected to consider the costs of accommodating the area’s huge tourism numbers. Also, that the CFO didn’t account for higher law enforcement salaries in Orange County.
“What I’m saying here is that the CFO ought to get his own house in order first, before he starts looking at someone else’s house,” Demings said.
Since DeSantis appointed him as CFO in July, Ingoglia has spearheaded a team of state auditors who have visited more than a dozen city and county governments to look for what they claim is waste, fraud, and abuse.
This DOGE tour comes as both men are on a full-fledged campaign to give Floridians a chance to vote to substantially reduce or eliminate taxes for homesteaded properties in a 2026 ballot measure. (Ingoglia would also be a likely candidate for CFO on that same statewide ballot).
Ingoglia and DeSantis are attempting to preempt criticism by local government officials that reducing property taxes would severely harm basic government services that they pay for, such as police, fire, parks and recreation, libraries, and public health.
Local government officials in other parts of the state have defended their increased budgets in recent years, citing inflation and rising population.
Ingoglia disparaged part of that argument on Monday, saying that Orange County’s population has only increased by 79,000 people in the past five years. And he said that in those same five years the county had hired 661 new employees.
The CFO said his DOGE team found $190 million in excessive spending during the audit period. He said auditors looked back to Orange County’s 2019-2020 fiscal year budget and increased it every year to account for inflation and population growth. They added two additional “buffers” of 5% and 10% to accommodate for the fact that government doesn’t run as efficiently as the private sector.
“When you factor in all of that, Orange County’s budget should be almost $200 million less than it is right now,” he said, adding that that broke down to about $148 per taxpayer.
He said the county could “easily” reduce the tax rate in Orange County by 0.86 mills and offer “real property tax relief.”
The CFO didn’t list any particular programs that would qualify under his definition of wasteful spending. DOGE auditors made requests to Orange County officials for information related to interactions and assistance to programs that serve Black, Carribean, and LGBTQ communities, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
And when DOGE auditors went to St. Petersburg last month, they posed numerous inquiries about DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion), resiliency, and climate change and specific purchases of electric vehicles.
‘Fiscally responsible”?
Part of the promise by Ingoglia and DeSantis is complete elimination of property taxes on homesteaded properties.
However, that likely constitutional amendment would not constitute a full revocation of property taxes, according to a key state legislator.
“We don’t see that as fiscally responsible,” state Rep. Toby Overdorf (R-Stuart) told WFLX television last week. Overdorf is co-chair of the select committee created by House Speaker Daniel Perez to study property tax relief.
Every piece of information was “quadruple-checked and verified” by the Florida Department of Revenue, Ingoglia said. “All they’re trying to do is keep the gravy train of your dollars flowing into their coffers so they can continue expanding government. Don’t buy it.”
During an Orlando press conference last month, Ingoglia accused Orange County officials of failing to cooperate with requests — that some employees provided incomplete, scripted answers in interviews and may have withheld or edited documents. Ingoglia said he planned to issue subpoenas to Orange County employees and may bring in digital forensic investigators.
Demings responded that all his employees had “fully cooperated” with Florida DOGE.
Ingoglia said on Monday that the issue of overspending in Orange County was so big that he predicted that “a lot” of local officials would be voted out of office, and then took a dig at Mayor Demings’ ambitions.
“You have a mayor now who’s deciding that he wants to run for governor,” he said. “This type of spending should be disqualifying.”
Orange County responds
Late on Monday afternoon, Demings, a Democrat, responded to Ingoglia’s comments in a press conference, sounding very much like a potential 2026 gubernatorial candidate. He said the CFO had made allegations “that factually just were not true” and that he had used some “fuzzy math” in making his calculations.
YouTube video screenshot of Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings in Orlando on September 15, 2025.
Regarding the basic numbers, Demings said the county’s population had increased by 125,488, not 79,000, citing the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research as his source. He said general revenue had increase by $474 million over the past five years, not $559 million as Ingoglia had alleged.
Much of that had to do with inflation, Demings insisted, raising the costs for a myriad of items, including what the state charges counties for public pensions and benefits. And he stressed that Orlando is the No. 1 tourist destination in North America, with more than 75 million tourists and an economic impact of more than $94 billion last year, according to Visit Orlando.
“That means that in addition to permanent residents, we must provide services for an additional 206,000 people every day within our community,” he said. “There is no other local government in Florida with that type of impact on services.”
Demings acknowledged that the county had hired 661 individuals over the past five years, but said that more than half of them (333) were public safety officials, and said that unlike the state, the county was paying them a competitive wage.
“As a former law enforcement officer, a former sheriff, a former chief of police, a former public safety director, what I can tell you is this: it is well known amongst those of us who truly have served in those capacities, that the corrections and prison guards don’t make what they should make in the state of Florida,” he said. “It is well known that the troopers are some of the lowest paid law enforcement officers in the state of Florida.”
Demings attacked state Republicans for failing to address the problems of high property insuranceand health costs, plus the lack of affordable housing in Florida.
He said that if the state sincerely cared about the county’s budget, “they would sit down and talk to us like decent folk would do, rather than issue subpoenas. They could have simply had a conversation with us. No, they wanted to be heavy-handed. They wanted to perform before the cameras. That’s what the residents of Florida are sick and tired of. They want people in office who are going to take care of the people of this state.”
Demings was asked by a reporter after his 14-minute press conference whether his response means that he had officially announced that he was running for governor.
“If I had announced that I was officially running for governor, I would have had a big announcement. That hadn’t happened yet, okay?” he said. “I’m not saying that I’m not going to run. Given these things that’s been happening, I just might do that.”

,California,2025-09-15 22:05:59+00:00,CalMatters,More California high school seniors applied for college financial aid this year than last,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/09/financial-aid-california-2/,"About 340,000 California students completed a financial aid application, up about 11% over last year.","In summary
About 340,000 California students completed a financial aid application, up about 11% over last year.


Nearly three-quarters of California public high school seniors applied for federal financial aid this year, soaring past last year’s figures by 11 percent and giving further indication that California’s efforts to get more students to apply for federal grants are paying off. 
This time last year about 307,000 high school seniors completed a financial aid application. This year, that number is around 340,000. The California Student Aid Commission that oversees college aid in the state released the information today. In 2023 a slightly higher share of seniors completed aid applications — about 74% to this year’s 72.7%. In 2024, the figure was 64%.
“We must take a moment to reflect and celebrate this achievement for California’s future,” said Daisy Gonzales, the commission’s executive director and who formerly led the state’s community college system, said in a statement. “With more high school seniors applying for financial aid, we can expect our higher education segments to serve more students.” A spokesperson for the commission, Shelveen Ratnam, said Gonzales and other commission executives were unavailable for an interview today.  
A 2021 state law required high schools to ensure their seniors complete financial aid applications. Neglecting to complete the application denies students the ability to receive $22,000 or more in state and federal financial aid in their first year of college. Last year the commission conducted market analysis to understand why parents and students do not apply for aid. Among the answers: families were skeptical that aid can actually be free.California is expected to spend about $2.9 billion on student financial aid in 2025-26, a major reason why more than half of California residents do not pay any tuition to attend the state’s public universities.
Immigration worries aren’t suppressing applications
Data that the commission shared with CalMatters also shows that more students whose parents don’t have lawful immigration status applied for federal financial aid than last year. Somewhat surprisingly, this year’s figures surpass those from 2023. 
The revelation for now rebuffs worries that the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown would prompt more college students to leave federal money on the table to try to protect their parents. 
About 64,700 high school seniors from so-called mixed-status families completed a Federal Application for Financial Aid, or FAFSA, in 2023 by the Sept. 2 deadline. In 2024, the figure dropped to just under 60,000. This year, it jumped to over 69,000.
The commission’s numbers capture the number of students who applied for state and federal financial aid in the spring to attend four-year universities and students who applied by Sept. 2 to be eligible for aid to attend community colleges. The decline in 2024 is attributed to major technology issues with a revamped FAFSA that blocked tens of thousands of students whose parents lacked Social Security numbers from completing the aid application. 
Unlike federal aid applications, California’s own Dream Act application does not share user data with federal agencies. The vast majority of students complete the FAFSA, though in recent years the commission has suggested to students in mixed status households that it may be safer to apply for just state aid. Other nonprofits focused on college access gave similar advice. “We cannot speculate as to why each student from a mixed-status family did or did not complete a FASFA,” Gonzales wrote in an email. But in her conversations with families in the San Diego area, she said the adults told her that giving their kids a better life was why they came to the U.S. Meanwhile, “families acknowledged the fact that they may be already sharing their data with the federal government,” she added, such as when they file taxes or adjust their immigration status.Roughly 3.3 million Californians live in mixed-status households, including 1 in 5 children under 18, according to 2021 data from Equity Research Institute, a USC research group.The California Dream Act Application gives students access to state tuition waivers and several thousand dollars in other grants, but FAFSA is the only way for students to also receive federal student loans and the Pell grant, which can provide more than $7,000 a year to low-income students. 
The student aid commission and its financial aid support partners hosted more than 1,200 workshops on completing financial aid applications this year and trained over 16,000 professionals to help students apply for the aid.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/101024_San-Diego-State_AH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-15 18:56:54.330340

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Death row inmate Steven Bixby may be obstinate and have atypical beliefs about the law, but he can still face execution, a judge decided.
Circuit Court Judge R. Scott Sprouse’s 24-page order, dated Friday, opens the door for Bixby to receive a death warrant, which would be the seventh issued since the state resumed executions in September 2024. Bixby’s attorneys could appeal the decision, potentially prolonging the process.
Another death row inmate, Gary Terry, appealed a Lexington County judge’s July decision that he was not intellectually disabled, which cleared the way for him to receive a death warrant as well unless a higher court intervenes. His appeal to the state Supreme Court is pending.
Delusions or political opinions? SC judge to decide if inmate is competent for execution

During a two-day hearing last month, Bixby told Sprouse he believes he is innocent of gunning down Abbeville County Deputy Danny Wilson and Constable Donnie Ouzts outside his parents’ house in 2003. Every court that has convicted him or upheld his sentence has violated the law, the 58-year-old said during an 11-minute address. Under Bixby’s reading of the Constitution, the only offense for which a person can be sentenced to death is treason, he said.
Bixby has “strong religious beliefs” that cause him to find “religious significance that others may not find correlated,” Sprouse wrote in his order.
Although psychiatrists laid out clear, strong beliefs that Bixby holds, none of the four experts who testified during his hearing last month “opine that these beliefs, whether on law or religion, rise to the level of delusion or render him incapable of understanding reality,” he wrote.
For instance, Bixby finds messages in numbers he believes hold special significance, and he has said an angel was present at the scene of his crime, his attorneys said. Bixby’s legal and religious beliefs sometimes intersect, such as in handwritten court filings in which he claimed judges who denied his appeals were controlled by Satan.
Because of his thoughts on the law, Bixby has been unable to effectively communicate with his team of attorneys, which is one of the two prongs that inmates must meet to be considered competent under state Supreme Court precedent, his attorneys argued.
Many of Bixby’s beliefs align with those of so-called constitutionalists, who believe the Constitution is the only valid law, and sovereign citizens, who denounce the government altogether, experts said.
Bixby hasn’t identified himself as belonging to any particular political group.
Besides, a person’s way of thinking about the law or religion, however atypical, can’t render them incompetent, Sprouse wrote.
Attorneys say inmate who killed 2 officers in 2003 shootout can’t be legally executed

“Neither the obstinance nor the desire for confirming arguments is relevant” in determining whether Bixby is competent, Sprouse wrote.
Psychiatrists hired by Bixby’s defense team, the attorney general’s office, the court and the Department of Corrections agreed that Bixby had narcissistic personality disorder, a mental condition that causes a person to believe themselves to be the center of the universe. He also had post-traumatic stress disorder, psychiatrists agreed.
Bixby angered easily and was often stubborn and difficult to work with, psychiatrists testified. But he was also able to understand when his anger was misplaced or work through it well enough to cooperate despite holding a grudge, Sprouse wrote.
For instance, Bixby once apologized to prison staff for accusing them of keeping him from talking to his attorney after learning his attorney was having a problem with the phone system, a Department of Corrections psychiatrist testified.
These sorts of cases “certainly demonstrate his ability to understand the circumstances of his reality, assess new information, exercise choice, and rationally communicate with others,” Sprouse wrote of Bixby.
“His beliefs may predispose, or even greatly predispose, him to anti-government thoughts — but does not form an unreasonable, unshakeable belief that interferes with choice,” Sprouse continued.
Death row inmate is not intellectually disabled, SC judge rules, clearing way for execution

Nothing in the law required Bixby to do what his attorneys suggested, Sprouse wrote. Even if Bixby doesn’t agree with the way the law works or legal decisions in his case, he understands the facts of his case, the reason he was sentenced to death and the finality of execution, Sprouse wrote. A basic understanding of the crime and its punishment is required for an inmate to be put to death.
Bixby is able to “rationally communicate whenever and with whomever he wishes,” and any conflict he has with his attorneys “is simply his obstinance regarding what the correct application of constitutional law should be, and his desire that the pursued arguments reflect those beliefs,” Sprouse wrote.
Despite disagreeing with his attorneys’ claim that he was incompetent, Bixby agreed to move forward with the argument, which showed his ability to communicate with his attorneys, even if he was a difficult client at times, Sprouse wrote.
“At most, it would appear that (Bixby) simply chooses at times not to agree and/or cooperate when his beliefs about constitutional rights or religion are directly challenged, and his personality disorders make such disagreement more difficult to manage,” Sprouse wrote.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4237-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 18:56:54.330340

UVM Health Network, the parent company of the state’s largest hospital, is “physically and spiritually distant” from its mission and from Vermonters’ needs, said the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, in Burlington on May 31, 2024.  File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
The state’s main health care regulator approved budgets for all 14 of Vermont’s community hospitals during two hearings convened last week. The Green Mountain Care Board forced a reduction of almost $95 million to the revenue that hospitals can receive next year from commercial insurers, with the large majority cut from the budget of the University of Vermont Medical Center, the state’s largest hospital, based in the Burlington area.
The care board annually reviews the hospitals’ budgets for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The process gives the board a way to place caps on what the hospitals can charge commercial insurers for services and how much revenue they can bring in as a result of those charges.
This year, the board approved the proposed budgets from eight of the state’s hospitals without any changes. UVM Medical Center’s allowed charges to commercial insurers were cut by roughly $88.5 million — from a proposed $1.16 billion net revenue from commercial insurers to the approved $1.07 billion. 
UVM Medical Center’s initial budget proposal already included a significant rate reduction of 7.9%. That percentage reduction took into account the requirements of new legislation as well as a care board enforcement action, which required lowered future costs to commercial insurers to compensate for the hospital receiving more revenue than the care board approved for fiscal year 2023. However, without those adjustments, the hospital’s request was for a 2.4% increase in commercial revenue. The board’s approved commercial revenue cap amounts to a 6.4% cut in general and a total of 16.7% decrease when the impact of the enforcement and new legislation is included. 
Relatively minor cuts were sustained by the other two Vermont members of the University of Vermont Health Network: Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin and Porter Hospital in Middlebury. The board also cut the budgets submitted by Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, Copley Hospital in Morrisville and Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington more substantially as a percentage of their size.
While the total dollar amount of budget reductions came in lower than what was cut during the same process last year, the review comes as curbing hospital and commercial insurance prices has become a matter of intense focus by the Legislature and the administration of Gov. Phil Scott. As a result of those efforts, which included a cap on hospital charges for outpatient injectable drugs, hospitals were already projecting smaller cost increases than in recent years.
Recently, the state’s Department of Financial Regulation, an appointed independent liaison and Scott himself have pushed to bring health care costs in line with what’s affordable for Vermonters.  
“The fact is, like in education, well-intentioned policies Vermonters were promised would make things better and more affordable are not working as intended, and many have become counterproductive,” Gov. Scott wrote in a Sept. 4 press release. “The status quo has allowed unacceptable amounts of administrative cost growth, unbearable pricing strategies, and perverse financial incentives and executive bonuses paid for by skyrocketing premiums,” he went on. 
The letter served as a signal to some longtime observers that this year’s decisions might have even more riding on them. 
“I’ve never seen anything remotely that incisive, quite frankly,” Sam Peisch, a policy analyst at the health care advocate’s office, said in an interview with VTDigger.

Focus on UVM Health Network
The board spent most of its discussion on Friday narrowing in on the imbalance in costs between UVM Medical Center, which provides direct patient care, and its parent company. The UVM Health Network owns two other Vermont hospitals — Central Vermont Medical Center and Porter Medical Center — and three in eastern New York state.
Board chair Owen Foster did not mince words at Friday’s meeting. 
“University of Vermont Health Network does not provide health care,” Foster said. “It’s essentially an expensive and ineffective layer of overpriced and unnecessary corporate bureaucracy that has proven itself both physically and spiritually distant and unconnected from the mission of our flagship academic medical center and the needs of Vermonters.” 
Foster outlined what he called the “corporate shell game” of cash flow from the medical center to the network and the network’s three New York hospitals. That cost shift results in the medical center’s profit margins and cash reserves appearing smaller than they should be, he said. 
During Friday’s hearing, Foster became particularly animated when citing the service cuts UVM Health Network made last year: He explained that while the network shuttered dialysis programs and clinics in the Mad River Valley, it also moved $10 million from UVM Medical Center to its New York hospitals.
Under the network’s management, Vermont’s hospitals have seen “unrelenting expense growth far exceeding inflationary metrics,” Foster said, while the quality of care has deteriorated and the gap between executive compensation and the network’s lowest-paid workers has widened.
Foster cited “excessive charges” for life-saving medications and medical imaging, and a waitlist of more than 3,000 patients for a colonoscopy, all while the network invests in its lobbying and external-relations arm. He worried about the impact of losing services like birthing centers or primary care clinics all across the state while individuals, families and insurers all struggle to keep up with the high cost of health care. 
The budget the care board approved purposely left no margin for the UVM Medical Center to add to its reserves, citing the fact that the hospital’s reserves go to the health network. Allocating more reserves to the medical center would go against the careboard’s mission, Foster said, “given [the Network’s] use of Vermont money to cover its inability to sustainably operate New York hospitals that it owns,” Foster said.  
Earlier in the week, Foster floated a proposed budget condition that would restrict the flow of funds from UVM Medical Center to the health network or to its New York hospitals. However, the health network’s general counsel Eric Miller filed a letter stating that the care board’s attempt to do so went beyond its mandate and violated the Constitution:
 “Seeking to regulate that interaction, at the eleventh hour of the budget-setting process, without taking any testimony, providing any opportunity for hearing, or setting any standards on the topic would be arbitrary and capricious and lead to unintended consequences that will inhibit hospitals and insurers from working together to reform the way health care is reimbursed,” Miller wrote. 
During the public comment period at Friday’s hearing, Stephen Leffler, UVM Medical Center’s president, responded to the board’s frustration with the structure of the health network saying, “I agree with many comments about how we have to be better and work better with you, but I do caution not to throw everything about the Network away.” 
He cited the good he sees coming from the network, like the flow of patients across both sides of the border with one electronic medical record system so that scans and tests done in one state can be used by a specialist in the other. Also, the relationship allows for the network to increase specialty services in different regions while also lightening the overall load on UVMMC, Leffler said.
The UVM Medical Center’s board of trustees is committed to making improvements to quality and meeting the care board’s budget requirements, said the hospital trustee chair Jesse Bridges, during Friday’s public comment period. “Our volunteer boards are working hard to do their best to make sure that we are pulling and pushing in the right direction,” Bridges added.
The care board also approved a budget condition that it says gives the hospital flexibility to lower prices for outpatient care as part of negotiation with insurers. 
Following the board decisions, UVM Health Network spokesperson Annie Mackin expressed the group’s desire to move forward with what the care board handed down. 
In a statement, she wrote: “University of Vermont Health Network is proud to provide health care to more than a million people in Vermont and northern New York. We have committed to collaborating as a strong partner in reducing expenses, limiting growth of hospital costs, and providing high-quality, sustainable care to the communities we serve.” 
She said that the network will review the written budget orders when they are published on Sept. 30.  “Much work remains, and we and our partners will need to continue taking steps to improve affordability not just in this budget cycle, but in the months and years ahead,” she added. 
In his Friday comments, Foster expressed gratitude for the providers and work of the hospitals themselves, despite high costs: “University of Vermont Medical Center’s problem is not with the care board or Vermont’s inability to give it money. It’s with its own corporate parent that has drained its assets and forced it to pay for an unnecessary layer of corporate bureaucracy. The Health Network has proven to be an irresponsible steward of Vermont’s limited health care dollars,” he said.

Spencer Cox talks to media after conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University in Orem on Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah and the rest of the nation continue to contend with the gruesome killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk in front of thousands of people at Utah Valley University last week, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox emphasized unity in a message for the state’s college students. 
“You can build a culture where we embrace differences without letting hate divide us, where hope is stronger than cynicism, and where forgiveness breaks the cycle of violence,” Cox said in a recorded video message that was circulated to university campuses on Monday. 
“My friends and Utahns, this is our moment,” he said. “The question is, do we escalate? Or do we walk down the better path? My prayer is that you will choose humanity, connection and love. And I believe with all my heart that you will.” 


Cox, a Republican, has made several appearances on national television in the days since Kirk’s shooting, which he has called a “political assassination.” He’s given multiple impassioned speeches — including one on Friday, when officials announced the suspected shooter, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, had been taken into custody — calling the shooting a “watershed (moment) in American history.” 
“The question is,” Cox said on Friday, “what kind of watershed? And that chapter remains to be written. Is this the end of a dark chapter in our history, or the beginning of a darker chapter in our history?” 
During appearances on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and on CNN over the weekend, Cox repeatedly pointed to an escalation of political violence in the U.S. in recent years — and he urged Americans to not wait for a political leader, whether it’s a president or a governor, to “lead us out of this,” but instead take individual actions to build bridges in their communities. 
He also repeatedly warned of the dangers of social media, which he called a “cancer on our society.”
‘Our nation is broken,’ Utah Gov. Cox says of Charlie Kirk assassination

“I can’t emphasize enough the damage that social media and the internet is doing to all of us. Those dopamine hits, these companies — trillion-dollar market caps, the most powerful companies in the history of the world — have figured out how to hack our brains, get us addicted to outrage … and get us to hate each other,” Cox said on “Meet the Press.”
Cox said he’s watched it happen “in real time” in the wake of Kirk’s killing, and “in every corner of our society.” 
“The conflict entrepreneurs are taking advantage of us. And we are losing agency,” Cox said. “We have to take that back. We have to turn it off. We have to get back to the community, caring about our neighbors, the things that make America great.”
It’s not the first time Cox has tried to encourage civility in politics — or has gone after social media companies. 
When he served as chair of the National Governor’s Association, Cox championed a “Disagree Better” campaign meant to discourage hyperpolarization and hate. And Cox has been a vocal supporter of Utah legislative efforts to regulate teen use of social media. Utah state leaders have also filed four lawsuits against major social media companies, including Meta, TikTok and Snapchat, over how addictive algorithms interact with minors.

State and local officials have not yet revealed more details about Kirk’s suspected shooter’s motives, but Cox pointed to shell casing engravings that indicated anti-fascist messages and vulgar internet memes. He also said, according to accounts from friends and family, that Robinson seemed to have been “radicalized.” 
“Clearly there was a lot of gaming going on. Friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep,” Cox said on “Meet the Press,” adding that the bullet casing inscriptions seem to show “the meme-ification that is happening in our society today.” 
Cox, in his message to Utah’s college students on Monday, acknowledged that the past week has been “incredibly tough.” 
“Right now, it may feel like rage is the only language in our politics, but you have the power to choose differently,” Cox said. “Every person you meet is more than a party, or more than a label, more than a post online. Everyone deserves dignity and respect.” 
That means, Cox said, “talking to people you disagree with, listening even when it’s hard, and forgiving, even when it feels impossible.”

“Campuses like yours must be a place of the free exchange of ideas,” he said. “It’s critical to our American experiment.” 
The governor challenged students to “spend less time online, where outrage has become so normal, and more time in the real world.” 
“Put down your phone. Read something that lifts your spirit. Go outside. Laugh with your friends. Serve your neighbors,” he said. “Remember, what happens online is not real life.” 
Cox also urged anyone who is skeptical whether “this can actually make a difference,” to “look around.”
“When tragedy struck this past week, there weren’t riots or destruction. There were vigils, prayers, and people coming together,” he said. “That’s the Utah way. Your generation can carry that forward.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)State and federal lawmakers have turned their eyes toward Iowa’s institutions of higher education as the fallout from right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk’s death continues, with Iowa university employees allegedly joining others online speaking about the incident in a positive light.
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, and Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, signed a letter directed to the Iowa Board of Regents this weekend calling for the immediate firing of employees who they said “publicly celebrated his killing online.”
“Each instance of social media posts with cheers, taunting, and vile glee is more disturbing than the last,” the letter stated. “Such behavior is sickening – no American’s death should be celebrated, especially by those charged with the honorable duty of educating Iowa’s youth.”

Kirk was shot last week while holding a public speaking event at Utah Valley University through his organization, Turning Point USA.
Collins identified the social media posts mentioned in the letter as coming from two Iowa State University employees, though the Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to independently verify the posts.
One of the posters stated they are “pretty sure we’re all okay with political violence,” but did not mention Kirk or the shooting. The other pointed out comments previously made by Kirk as to the trade-off of gun deaths and 2nd Amendment rights, saying in their post he “got what was coming” and they are “happy he’s rotting in hell now.”
The comments referenced in the post come from a speech by Kirk in 2023, according to a Newsweek article from the time, during which he said he believes some gun deaths annually are worth having the 2nd Amendment — calling it the “cost” of getting to own guns and “protect our other God-given rights.”
ISU spokesperson Angie Hunt said in an email the university doesn’t have any comment on the employees, posts or possible investigation.
Iowa Board of Regents President Sherry Bates released multiple statements in the wake of the killing, the first reaffirming the board’s belief in free speech and that “no one should feel unsafe when sharing their views.” She stated in her second statement, released Sept. 12, that the board was aware of posts from university students and employees on Kirk, and his death “should not be celebrated.”
“These posts and others like them are offensive, insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the Board of Regents or its universities,” Bates said in her statement on social media posts. “The comments are inconsistent with the Board’s values to create a civil and respectful environment at our public universities.”


Regents president highlights campus intellectual freedom centers
Bates also mentioned in her first statement, released Sept. 11, how efforts to form “civic and intellectual freedom centers” on public university campuses show the board’s commitment to keeping Iowa’s public colleges safe and respectful of “open dialogue.”
“These centers will provide scholarship and discussion regarding our great nation and the Constitutional principles on which it was founded,” Bates said in her statement. “Differing opinions will be heard, but threats and violence are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.”
The board is set to approve the membership of an advisory council to the University of Iowa’s center for intellectual freedom at its meeting this week, with the center currently in formation after state law required it.
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks said in a post on X that the UI should name its new center after Kirk, which would honor who she described as “a true defender of free speech and open debate.”


However, Collins’s and Evans’s letter stated such statements are not enough to fix what they’ve identified as wrong on Iowa college campuses.
The social media posts referenced by Collins are proof of how far higher education has strayed from its base mission, the letter stated, and universities are no longer “the epicenter of civil debate and respectful discourse, the very pillar of Charlie Kirk’s ethos.”
“Boilerplate press releases will not solve the culture problem on our college campuses – only decisive action with a clear red line,” the letter stated. “Today, we are calling for any university employees who celebrated the death of their fellow American to be terminated immediately.”
Board of Regents spokesperson Josh Lehman said in an email he has nothing to add from the statements made by Bates last week, in response to questions sent by the Iowa Capital Dispatch about the social media posts and whether they have been verified by the board.
The board will go into closed session Wednesday morning, Lehman said in his email — a late addition to the Sept. 17-18 meeting agenda.
According to the closed session notice, the board will discuss items relating to student and employee records and “evaluate the professional competency of an individual whose appointment, hiring, performance or discharge is being considered as necessary to prevent needless and irreparable injury to that individual’s reputation.” They will also discuss topics involving current or imminent litigation, according to the notice.
Universities in Mississippi and South Carolina have already suspended or fired employees for making online comments about Kirk’s death, including Clemson University and the University of Mississippi.
PEN America, the U.S. branch of an international nonprofit dedicated to protecting free expression, released a statement expressing alarm at faculty and staff losing their jobs across the U.S. for posting about Kirk, from Florida to Tennessee and more.
PEN America Program Director for Campus Free Speech Kristen Shahverdian said in the release “knee-jerk dismissals” of faculty and staff for online comments “raises concerns about institutions responding to political pressure and social media outrage” rather than reviewing cases with due process and with the same standards.
“Faculty in particular have broad leeway to speak on issues of the day, a necessary protection for academic freedom and scholarship. However, when administrators fire faculty over social media commentary—whether that speech is offensive or topical—they set a precedent that will be used to silence scholars and students across the spectrum,” Shahverdian said in the release.  “These firings reverberate beyond the campus walls, creating a culture of fear across society at large.  Universities should rebuke violent rhetoric and condemn offensive speech, but they should not impose blanket firings on protected speech.”

The FAIR Plan faces accusations of denying smoke-damage claims and more. Can California lawmakers keep the insurer of last resort accountable?


In the closing days of the legislative year, California lawmakers sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a bill that is meant to toughen scrutiny of the state’s embattled fire insurer of last result by insisting that two of their leaders join its governing committee.
Assembly Bill 234 would put the state’s two top lawmakers — currently Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas — on the governing committee of the FAIR Plan, the insurer that’s mandated by law to sell policies to homeowners who can’t get them from other insurance companies. But the lawmakers or their representatives would be non-voting members of the committee, raising concerns about the bill’s effectiveness.
The FAIR Plan, which is an alliance of insurers that do business in the state, has grown to more than 610,000 policies as of June, a 154% increase since September 2021. It has become one of the largest insurers in California as other insurance companies have canceled or stopped issuing new policies here, citing growing wildfire risk. The plan is run by its member insurers — not the state. Its governing committee consists of mostly insurance representatives, though the governor appoints some non-voting members.
Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara asked the governor to sign the bill, saying in a letter dated Saturday that it “will help further needed transparency of this insurance safety net while supporting legislative policymakers’ oversight efforts.”
The bill, which the Assembly sent to the governor on Saturday, would be effective immediately and comes at a time of numerous challenges for the FAIR Plan:

It faces lawsuits from homeowners who say they have been denied coverage for their smoke-damage claims from the Los Angeles County fires in January. Hilary McLean, spokesperson for the FAIR Plan, said the plan would not comment on ongoing litigation.
In July, the state’s Insurance Department filed legal action (not a lawsuit) against the plan, accusing it of denying more than 200 smoke-damage claims and saying the department’s multiyear investigation found hundreds of violations of consumer-protection laws. The FAIR Plan has responded to the department’s Order to Show Cause by requesting a hearing before a state administrative body. McLean said the plan has been working with the department over the past year to “update and clarify its policy language around smoke damage, so the language reflects the manner in which these claims are being adjusted.”
Earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the FAIR Plan of violating court orders related to covering smoke damage and urging it to start approving smoke-damage claims “expeditiously.” McLean said the plan “appreciates Gov. Newsom’s concerns about handling claims quickly and fairly. We are committed to ensuring that every policyholder is treated with compassion, respect and in full accordance with California law.” She said the plan will submit a response to the governor this week.

McLean said the plan does not have a position on the governing-committee legislation.
The smoke-damage complaints come on top of numerous other issues FAIR Plan policyholders and insurance professionals have raised. As CalMatters reported last year and earlier this year, those include poor customer service, payment delays and slow response times, which the plan attributed to growing pains.
Lara supported the bill, saying in a submitted argument that “the FAIR Plan…must work harder to be more accountable to the public.”
The Consumer Federation of California opposed the bill, criticizing it for not having enough teeth. 
“Is it a bad thing? Probably not,” Robert Herrell, executive director of the nonprofit group, told CalMatters. “But if anybody thinks that putting two non-voting members on the committee is going to be meaningful, they’re deluding themselves.” 
Herrell, a former deputy insurance commissioner under former Commissioner Dave Jones, said the FAIR Plan governing committee — which is mostly made up of the insurance industry — will still have the ability to conduct business behind closed doors.
Joel Laucher, who also worked under Jones and is now a program specialist at consumer advocacy group United Policyholders, used to go to the FAIR Plan’s governing committee meetings as chief deputy commissioner of rate regulation. He said at several meetings, he would have to wait while the committee’s executives went into closed sessions.
“They stated that their executive sessions were privileged, confidential and not open to the department,” Laucher said. 
But he said it could still be useful to have state lawmakers on the committee who could learn more about the workings of the FAIR Plan. “Having direct experience as a legislator might provide them with some understanding and information they might need to initiate broader authority over the FAIR Plan,” he said.
During the vote on Friday, Democratic Sen. Anna Caballero of Merced said the roles of the two lawmakers or their representatives would “mirror that of the governor’s four existing non-voting appointees.”  
Paying claims over time
The Legislature also passed AB 226, which will allow the FAIR Plan to get bond financing through the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. The bill aims to ensure the plan, which has warned about its continued ability to pay claims, will be able to spread out financing its claims payments over time. 
Assemblymember David Alvarez, the Democrat from Chula Vista who co-authored the bill, told CalMatters that funding for the FAIR Plan was a priority for the Legislature.  
“If the FAIR Plan became insolvent, our (insurance) crisis would become a disaster,” said Sen. Roger Niello, the Republican from Roseville who’s vice chair of the Senate insurance committee. 
Automatic payments
Lastly, lawmakers sent AB 290 to the governor’s desk. The bill requires the FAIR Plan to establish a system for its policyholders to make automatic payments. The FAIR Plan originally opposed the bill but now has no position on it, McLean said. The plan will have to create the system to give policyholders the automatic-payment option by April 1, 2026, but policyholders cannot be canceled or not renewed if they don’t enroll in it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-15 17:56:46.537810

The plaintiffs also contend the Oklahoma State Department of Education and the state Board of Education failed to uphold state laws and regulations, including the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act, when approving the new standards in February. 
Half of the board’s sitting members said they were unaware the version of the standards they approved contained significant differences from the original draft the Education Department released in December. Key differences include disputed claims that there were “discrepancies” in 2020 presidential election results and that the origin of COVID-19 was a Chinese lab.
The Education Department waited weeks after the vote to publicly share the version of the standards with the new content included. Neither the board’s meeting agenda nor state agency staff acknowledged the changes before the vote.
Academic standards are a lengthy list of topics that Oklahoma public schools must teach to students at certain grade levels.
The plaintiffs contend the new social studies standards would violate students’ religious liberties by requiring schools to teach from the Bible.
Under the new standards, elementary students have to learn Bible stories and Jesus’ teachings “that influenced the American colonists, founders and culture.” In fifth and eighth grades, students must be taught the Judeo-Christian values that influenced America’s founders.
Attorneys from the national organization Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the local Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice are representing the plaintiffs.
“Public school classrooms may not be used to endorse religious doctrine — no matter what the religion is or how many people follow it,” said Brent Rowland, Oklahoma Appleseed’s legal director. “Blocking these standards means Oklahoma students can learn history and civics in a way that respects every family’s beliefs while inspiring them to think critically, ask questions, and engage as informed members of our democracy. This ruling moves us toward the open, rigorous, and inclusive public education our students deserve.”
The state Department of Education did not immediately comment on the Court ruling 
Justices James Winchester, James Edmondson, Douglas Combs, Noma Gurich and Richard Darby concurred in the decision.
Chief Justice Dustin Rowe and Justice John Kane IV dissented. Two justices, Dana Kuehn and Travis Jett, recused.
Kane issued a single quote in dissent, stating he would prefer the case first go through a trial court.
Rowe wrote a full dissenting opinion, stating a trial court rather than the Supreme Court is meant to review the allegations of an Open Meeting Act violation.
“The 2025-2026 school year is well underway with the 2025 Standards in effect in school districts across the state,” Rowe wrote. “To issue an injunction at this point — months after the alleged Open Meeting Act violation and after the 2025-2026 academic has commenced-would be contrary to our legal precedent and disruptive to school curriculum statewide.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Rural hospitals are less likely to offer obstetric services after they’ve been acquired by a larger health system, leading to mixed outcomes for mothers and babies, according to new research.
It’s part of an accelerating trend that’s reshaped how Americans get health care: Larger health systems gobble up smaller facilities in a bid for financial stability.
“The hospital industry has undergone tremendous transformation over the past few decades, with nearly 1,600 mergers between 1998 and 2021,” said Martin Gaynor, a coauthor of the study and emeritus professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon, in a statement.
Those large-scale changes to the health system can affect costs, quality and access to care, he said.
Over the past five years, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies or announced they’ll stop in 2025, according to the most recent data from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform. Less than half of rural hospitals still offer labor and delivery services.
Gaynor and a team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon, Northwestern University and the University of Georgia examined how hospital mergers have affected access to obstetric care in rural areas, and the quality of that care. They found that rural hospitals were part of more than 450 mergers from 2006-2019.
Once those rural hospitals were acquired by larger systems, they were 30% less likely to still offer labor and delivery services five years later. Many of the shuttered obstetric departments were the sole local source of obstetric care.
That loss translated to fewer resources — such as practicing OB-GYNs — in the county where the acquired hospital was located, researchers found.
The number of births in those counties didn’t change; families just had to go elsewhere for care.
Less access to nearby care could explain those counties’ small increases in health problems among women during or after pregnancy and child birth, and higher rates of smoking among pregnant women, researchers said.
On the flip side, they found that some patients went to higher-quality facilities farther away. And in rural hospitals that didn’t close their obstetric departments following a merger, the quality of care tended to rise.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

In recent years, officials in dozens of states have championed laws to increase oversight of mergers and other health care dealmaking.
In the wake of devastating hospital closures tied to corporate financial maneuvering, some states have strengthened their antitrust laws.
Last year alone, 22 states enacted at least 34 laws related to health system consolidation and competition, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, an advisory think tank for lawmakers. Other states, meanwhile, have paved the way for health mergers in a bid to save failing rural hospitals.
At least 35 states now require hospitals, health systems, providers and private equity firms to notify a state official of proposed mergers or other contracts.
Earlier this month, California lawmakers passed a bill to expand the state’s authority in overseeing mergers and acquisitions in health care. It’s headed to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, though Newsom vetoed a similar measure last year.
At the federal level, President Donald Trump’s administration has not signaled an interest in increasing antitrust oversight. But Trump’s recent tax and spending law did include $50 billion in funding over the next decade aimed at helping states strengthen rural health care. Massive cuts to Medicaid also in the law could have devastating impacts on rural hospitals struggling to stay afloat, however.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services this week announced that states have until Nov. 5 to apply for rural health funding. States must show that they’ll use the federal dollars in a way that aligns with certain CMS goals, including helping improve access to care and strengthening retention of health care workers.

School officials from Stowe and Morristown said a merger is the best possible scenario for what they called a likelihood of district consolidation under H.454.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in News & Citizen on Sept. 11, 2025.
Seven years after their state-arranged marriage and four years after the voter-approved divorce, the Stowe and Elmore-Morristown school boards have unanimously passed resolutions recommending another merger.
After school board meetings on Monday and Tuesday, Lamoille South Supervisory Union Superintendent Ryan Heraty, who oversees schools in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore, submitted the resolutions to the Vermont Legislature’s School District Redistricting Task Force, which has been tasked with drafting new school district boundaries under H.454, a bill that tees up sweeping education reform for the state.

“If the redistricting task force requires a merger of the Stowe School District, we support a joint district with the Elmore-Morristown Unified Union School District (EMUU),” reads the resolution.
School officials from Stowe and Morristown said a merger is the best possible scenario for what they called a likelihood of district consolidation under H.454. While they’d prefer keeping individual districts, the officials said a lack of representation on the redistricting task force might lead to a greater consolidation of the greater Lamoille County school system, which includes three supervisory unions with more than 20 schools spread out over roughly 400 square miles. According to Heraty, that would be disastrous.
H.454, which passed in June, established a new student-weighted formula for state education funding and a process for drawing larger school districts across Vermont. The initiatives go together, according to Heraty, a PhD candidate in education leadership and policy who has been outspoken about the bill’s potentially negative effects on rural schools.
“They need to draw new districts to make their formula work,” Heraty said.
The redistricting task force has until December to draft new districts, at which point it will present them to the Legislature. The group met on Wednesday in Waterbury, after press deadline, and discussed two potential models for district consolidation, one based on counties and another based on regional technical education centers, according to agenda items. In this case, Green Mountain Technology and Career Center also serves schools in the Lamoille North and Orleans Southwest supervisory unions.
At this week’s meetings, Stowe and Morristown-Elmore school board members and Heraty spoke against those types of districts. Under the state’s proposed funding formula, Stowe and Morristown-Elmore work well together, they said, but folding them into a bigger district will have a negative impact on students, teachers, administration and taxpayers.
‘It’s like when you get married’
The Stowe and Elmore-Morristown districts are well-positioned for a merger, Heraty said. The boards and administration have already navigated one before and many of the same players are still around, and the schools, which are relatively connected geographically, share sports teams and transportation routes. But most importantly for some school officials, Stowe and Elmore-Morristown are solvent, and they don’t want to incur new debt.
“Nobody is talking about debt right now, but it’s a huge factor,” Heraty said,
It’s not like the schools in Stowe and Morristown don’t need work — Stowe voters rejected a $39 million bond in 2023. Instead of bond votes, the districts have opted to chip away at capital projects with smaller investments from the reserve fund year after year, Heraty said.
The Lamoille North Supervisory Union has taken a different approach. Over the past decade or so, the district has taken on five bonds totaling more $18 million for school projects, including $10 million for Hyde Park Elementary School. The oldest bond retires in June 2027 and the youngest June 2048.
“It’s a puzzle lawmakers haven’t solved,” Heraty said. “As soon as they start saying to taxpayers, ‘You’re going to have to encumber debt you didn’t vote for,’ people are going to revolt.”
Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, a redistricting task force member and former Vermont Secretary of Education, said the debt implications vary based on how the districts shape up.
“It’s like when you get married, you marry someone with all their blessings and faults,” Holcombe said. “Everybody brings something to the table.”
According to the resolutions, the combined district would also balance under the state’s new student-weighted funding formula. For example, Stowe alone would lose millions, Heraty said, but combining with Morristown-Elmore — and creating a district with a demographically diverse population and a relatively large student body and property grand list — would generate enough funding to cover expenses.
Jed Lipsky, I-Stowe, who voted against H.454, said the proposed merger is the best possible scenario, given the legislation coming down the pike.
“There’s going to be a lot of change statewide,” Lipsky said. “Hopefully ours will be minimal, but it would be a great first step to have Lamoille South restructured as it had been.”
Déjà vu?
On Tuesday night, the Elmore-Morristown school board passed the resolution unanimously after a four-minute conversation, but the Stowe vote was drawn out over two meetings.
During the initial conversation for Stowe last week, the proposed resolution took board member Andrew Kohn by surprise, and he requested more time to review it. Board member Ryan Bennett was also absent from that meeting.
“I’m afraid of the public’s view of this,” Kohn said. “I’d be very uncomfortable reversing a 3-2 majority vote from two years ago that separated the districts without having public input on whether they want to join again.”
In 2018, the Stowe and Elmore-Morristown school districts were forced to merge under Act 46, which passed three years earlier, but local representatives and school leaders fought tooth and nail to overturn the merger. The effort was reaffirmed by a 1,068-464 vote to separate in 2021.
To some voters, this week’s recommendation to merge again may represent a flip-flop from 2021, but Stowe school board chair Tiffany Donza said the board is merely responding to the state’s changing education policies over the last two and a half decades.
Donza supported the separation in 2021. At the time, Stowe was pursuing a $39 million bond for renovations to the middle and high school, and she didn’t feel it was fair to burden Morristown-Elmore taxpayers with that expense. Had Donza known the bond would fail, she said she might have felt differently about the separation. She noted that Stowe’s property tax rate shot up after the separation due to Act 127, which landed around the same time.
Unlike with Act 46, Donza said the fight with H.454 isn’t exclusive to maintaining individual districts. Act 60 in 1997 was about funding, Act 46 was about a governance structure and H.454 is about both, she said.
“That’s the biggest part people need to understand,” Donza said. “The new funding formula is going to get overlaid on districts, and if they left us alone it will be a form of punishment, intentional punishment, because we won’t have the money to operate our schools.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee announced Monday afternoon his administration will give the cash-strapped Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) over half a million dollars, but it won’t go toward the agency’s operational costs.
Instead, $510,000 has been earmarked for three projects meant to help the state’s public bus agency meet Rhode Island’s lofty climate goals.
The funding is part of a larger $1.5 million fiscal 2026 spending plan approved by the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4) at its meeting Monday afternoon.
“The approval of this funding represents continued investment in Rhode Island’s progress toward a climate-resilient future,” McKee said.
And crucial to that task, the governor said, is in exploring lower cost transit options as outlined in the “budget framework” he reached with the agency to avoid bus driver layoffs under a now abandoned plan originally proposed July 24 to address a $10 million budget deficit. 
RIPTA was considering cutting or reducing 58 routes but instead will reduce service by cutting some buses, reducing schedule spans, decreasing frequency, and getting rid of segments on 46 different lines.
In return, McKee is filling RIPTA’s deficit with $3 million in federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality funds the agency will have to pay back later. 
The $510,000 is for three specific programs: on-demand transit services, a “vanpool” subsidy program, and a new effort to promote public transportation to visitors traveling to Rhode Island.
The bulk of RIPTA’s share of the financial package — $440,000 — will go toward trips that can be booked in advance in Newport, Middletown, Narragansett, South Kingstown and Woonsocket.
Another $15,000 is earmarked toward continuing RIPTA’s “vanpool” services, which allows a group of commuters to lease a shared vehicle through Enterprise Rent-A-Car and use it for daily commutes in areas without robust bus service. Costs to use a van vary based on mileage, but start around $50 a month, according to RIPTA.
In return, the statewide bus agency provides commuters with a $100 subsidy. The EC4’s spending plan adds an additional $200 monthly subsidy for new vanpool riders.
The remaining $55,000 for RIPTA will be used to promote transit to offer roughly 4,000 complimentary bus passes to travelers who fly into Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport and stay in nearby hotels.
Funding is not allowed to be used toward RIPTA operations, Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management spokesperson Kim Keough confirmed in a phone call Monday afternoon. She said EC4 funding is only eligible for the three earmarked projects and must be spent within a year.
Funds are expected to be disbursed in November or December, Keough said in a text message.
RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand thanked the McKee administration for the $500,000.
“This funding will allow RIPTA to not only improve mobility for residents, workers, and tourists, but also help grow ridership and advance Rhode Island’s long-term climate and transportation goals,” he said in a statement.

The voluntary program connects defendants with trained community navigators who refer them to mental health treatment and other services. If a defendant successfully completes a navigation plan in collaboration with court staff, the courts will dismiss the charges against them. Those who fail to remain engaged with available services will still face criminal proceedings.
To be eligible, someone must meet three criteria: have a confirmed severe mental illness; be charged with a misdemeanor — except for DWI — or a nonviolent felony; and have had their competency raised in a criminal case in the last five years or have been ordered into assisted outpatient treatment or civil commitment in a locked psychiatric facility.
The Administrative Office of the Courts and the First Judicial District Court announced the project on Sept. 8, but launched it in April, according to the program’s first monthly report. In the program’s first three months, court officials clarified its eligibility criteria; expanded how they collect data on it; and hired the University of New Mexico to study its implementation and outcomes, the report states.
The project in July screened 670 cases of people held in local jails, determined nine people were eligible and enrolled three, the report states. A tenth person was found eligible and enrolled earlier, either in May or June, AOC Spokesperson Barry Massey told Source NM. Of the four who initially enrolled, only one remained as of publication, with the others failing to meet the program’s criteria. Eligibility decisions were pending in four cases.
Court officials shared the data at the program’s launch celebration Friday in Presiding Judge Donita Sena’s courtroom at the Santa Fe County Magistrate Court.
“If we have a defendant that is going to come through our courts, and they need resources, and if we have that ability to give that to them, then by God, that’s what we’re going to do,” Sena told the people gathered in the courthouse.
The pilot program is designed to serve up to 30 participants at any given time, the report states, based on funding and navigation service delivery. It is meant to help a “very narrow” population, AOC Senior Statewide Behavioral Health Manager Stacey Boone said at the event on Friday.
Across the state in July, in the four existing competency diversion pilot projects, 65 people were found eligible and 22 people enrolled, according to AOC data. There were 62 active cases and six graduations, the data show.
State Supreme Court Justice Briana Zamora, the court’s liaison to the Commission on Mental Health and Competency that started the pilots, said for too long, many people found to be incompetent have cycled through the criminal legal system because instead of receiving timely treatment or services, they sit in jail waiting for their cases to be dismissed.
“This pilot program is about intervention over incarceration,” Zamora said in remarks at the event. “It is about giving people a real chance to stabilize, recover and return to our community with dignity and support.”

Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — For the second month in a row, Nebraska’s general fund tax receipts came in modestly above forecasts, but there’s still a ways to go to fill the state’s projected deficit.
The Department of Revenue released Nebraska’s August tax receipts Monday showing a net gain of 2% over what Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board predicted in April. That jump equates to roughly $12 million in additional tax revenues flowing into the state’s coffers.
Nebraska ended the last fiscal year with net tax receipts down about $86 million from forecasts, leading to a projected state budget deficit of about $95 million.
The latest receipts help with filling that deficit, along with Nebraska’s July receipts being roughly $20 million higher than projections. The forecasting board considers these reports when making revenue projections, Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said.

But the progress also must contend with other economic factors, including the federal budget reconciliation bill. A different revenue report that came out earlier this month shared that the new tax and spending law could cost Nebraska’s state government about $216 million over the next two years.
The biggest contributors to higher revenues in August were individual income taxes, which came in 5.1% above projections, and sales and use taxes, which came in 3.2% above projections.
Neither Patent nor Appropriations Committee Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood was certain about the reasons why. Patent said September is usually a high revenue month for the state because that’s when estimated tax payments are due. Perhaps enough people paid early to account for the increase, but she said she couldn’t be sure. Clements also speculated that it might be business officials paying taxes for their businesses through individual income taxes.
On the flip side, corporate income taxes came in 31.2% below projections for August. Neither Clements or Patent could say with any certainty what caused that either.
July and August’s receipts broke a months-long pattern of Nebraska’s tax revenues falling below forecasts. However, Clements and Patent each said it’s too early to say whether this is a sign the state’s monthly revenues will keep moving in a positive direction.
“One month at a time,” Clements said. “We’re just watching it.”

Sanders contacted Republican Party of Arkansas Chairman Joseph Wood and Democratic Party of Arkansas Chairman Col. Marcus Jones to certify the vacancy on Monday, according to a news release from Sanders’ office.
Each party must notify Sanders or her chief legal counsel, Cortney Kennedy, within 10 days whether they plan to hold a primary election or a convention of delegates in order to choose their candidate for the special election, according to the news release.
Stubblefield, a Republican from Branch, died Sept. 2 at the age of 74. He had served a dozen years in the Senate and previously four years in the House of Representatives. He lay in state at the Capitol on Thursday, and his funeral and burial occurred Saturday in Charleston.
Senate District 26 includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties. Stubblefield won reelection last year to a term that ends in 2029.
The most recent special election for the Arkansas Legislature was in February 2022 when Republican Colby Fulfer narrowly defeated Democrat Lisa Parks to represent a portion of Northwest Arkansas. Both parties held primary elections before the general election.
Fulfer succeeded Sen. Lance Eads, R-Springdale, who resigned in October 2021 to take a position with a consulting firm. Fulfer left the Senate at the end of Eads’ term in 2023.

(Courtesy of Brookings Register)The halcyon days of the for-profit newspaper are over, and that’s not news.
There are just too many competing sources of information for printed papers to command the kind of attention and rake in the kind of advertising dollars they did in the pre-internet era.
But that doesn’t mean the days of newspapers are gone.
At least that’s the bet Corey Champion and his father, Scott, made last month. 
Scott is the CEO of North Carolina-based Champion Media, which acquired four South Dakota newspapers that were shuttered without notice in early August by News Media Corp. That Illinois company blamed the closures on down times for newspapers, and on the collapse of a deal that would’ve sold its 30-plus mostly rural newspapers to another company.
When the deal died, so did the Huron Plainsman, Brookings Register, Moody County Enterprise and Redfield Press. 
Corey, chief financial officer for Champion Media, talked recently with South Dakota Searchlight about why his North Carolina-based company decided to bring the papers back to life.
The following conversation is edited for length and clarity.
How did your family wind up in the newspaper business?
I’m the third generation in the newspaper business. My grandfather and grandmother started a penny saver [a freely distributed local advertising publication] in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and then another one in Monmouth, Illinois. They eventually sold out to a company that later became known as Gannett [owner of USA Today and the Argus Leader, among others]. 
Company’s sudden shutdown closes four newspapers in eastern South Dakota

My father actually stayed on board with the company when they sold out, worked his way up. At the time, I was still in college, getting my master’s degree in accounting from the University of Iowa. Afterward, I went and worked for the Kohler company for a while, and kind of specialized in accounting, and then mergers and acquisitions, which I really enjoy doing.
In 2017, my dad had decided it was time to go out on his own. And I was just wrapping up the sale of a furniture company with Kohler, and we decided that we were going to get together. We purchased a group of newspapers from Civitas Media in North Carolina and South Carolina. And then shortly after, purchased the Maysville, Kentucky, Ledger Independent from Lee Enterprises [owner of the Rapid City Journal, among others]. We brought them back private from the corporate side.
How does your company approach the news business?
What we try to do is try to stay very small, nimble and lean, but offer all the back end support — accounting, human resources, finance — so these little community newspapers can just concentrate on reporting local news and selling local advertising. That’s essentially what our business model is. We support these local communities so the staff don’t have to worry about opening mail, cutting checks or worrying about what the payables are. 
How does that work for you financially?
Our values are supporting local journalism and communities. We’re not really out trying to make money for shareholders. We’re essentially just trying to stay profitable, and to not lose money in any market. And the nice thing about being so small and nimble is that we understand that some markets have down years and other other markets have good years. We don’t have to pull the plug in a market because they had one down year. 
A dangerous void grows as South Dakota newspapers close

And we’re very conscious of what we spend our money on. If we can operate our office in 1,000 square feet and make sure it’s affordable and sustainable, that’s what we’re going to do. If we don’t need an internet and a cable service in our office, we’re not going to add a cable service. We try to make all the cuts where we can, so that we can spend our money on pay for the employees. 
That’s really the hardest part in this industry. It’s kind of like being a teacher. There are a lot of teachers, and there are a lot of journalists, that don’t do it for the money. You get rewarded in a lot of other ways.
That’s something that often gets lost when you read about newspapers falling apart. For 100 years, there was no internet, and the newspaper was the primary source of information. It basically printed its own money. Those are the glory days everybody thinks and talks about. That doesn’t exist anymore. And so if you’re a shareholder buying publicly traded stock, thinking that you’re going to buy something that’s going to go back to its glory days, that’s not going to happen.
How did you learn about this opportunity for these four papers?
I got a phone call and heard kind of through the grapevine what was happening. After doing some basic research on the markets, I thought ‘you know, these are really good communities.’ With a few changes, I felt like they could be a sustainable market. 
For example, cutting the days, from printing five days a week to two days a week. I’d say that’s more of a standard practice nowadays. The majority of our costs are actually associated with the delivery costs, coming from the post office, that we have absolutely no control over. 
When you’re looking at how much people are paying for a subscription and how much it costs to deliver them a paper five days a week, you’re losing money on every paper you deliver. But if you only deliver two days a week, it cuts that expense way down and lets you send out a better, bigger paper, where you give people more of what they want to read.
Are we talking about a two-day-a-week product in Huron and Brookings?
The weeklies (Redfield Press and Moody County Enterprise) will stay weekly, but Brookings and Huron will be two days a week. I would love to keep putting out a paper five days a week, but I would rather put out a paper two days a week than put out no paper at all, right? That’s kind of what it comes down to.
Had you been to South Dakota before? Did you know much about the state before this?
We have a paper in North Dakota, then up to Minnesota. I’ve been to Minnesota and North Dakota. I figured it wouldn’t be much different. Plus I grew up in Iowa and Illinois. They’re kind of just good old Midwest towns, and I really believe those good Midwest towns will still support their local newspaper and local journalism. That was a piece that I really liked.
So what is the future? How long does it last? Where are we going in the long term?
There’s a huge uptick in our digital, online readership. A print paper isn’t going to be printed forever. But local journalists, and the newspaper aspect of writing local content to gain readership and selling advertising to help support it, then finding enough community members to buy subscriptions to support it, that will always continue. In a smaller market that doesn’t have a TV station, that maybe has a radio station, people heavily rely on us to communicate to them about what’s going on. They need a watchdog. 
I think what happened here is a good example. When these papers abruptly shut down, everybody in the community kind of realized that they actually missed their newspaper, and they wanted it more than they were giving the paper credit for. Oftentimes newspapers get a bad rap, where people like to complain about the content in the paper. But then when there’s no content at all, there’s really a void that they don’t want to have in their community. 
So I think that the newspapers will continue forever. I wouldn’t be in this industry if I thought otherwise. I just don’t know that the actual print paper will last forever.

Francetta L. Mays earlier this month filed paperwork with the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s office in hopes of putting the idea before voters in the form of State Question 838.
The measure asks voters to designate June 1 as “Greenwood Remembrance and Reconciliation Day.”
The day would recognize the trauma the overlooked community is still suffering, Mays said Monday.
“Lives were lost,” Mays said. “The economic development of the community has suffered.”
Mays is associate pastor of Vernon AME Church in the Greenwood District. The church is the only surviving Black-owned structure from the 1921 race massacre.
The day would recognize and honor the victims and survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre, which occurred from May 31 to June 1, 1921. White mobs burned and destroyed 35 blocks of Black homes and businesses in the Tulsa neighborhood. Officially around three dozen residents died, but some estimate as many as 300 people were killed. 
The proposed measure would not have a fiscal impact on the state.
It seeks to create a new law.
Because it is a new law and not a constitutional amendment, 92,262 signatures would be needed to put the measure on the ballot. A constitutional change requires 172,993 signatures to get on the ballot. 
Michael Byrd, of Washington, D.C., runs the Bridge Points Project, which works to unstick “the most stuck political issues with ballot measures.” The organization is partnering with Mays on the proposed state question.
If approved by voters, the measure would just create a day of observance, he said.
“I can’t think of any more of an Oklahoma issue than the Tulsa Race Massacre,” he said.
Polling indicates it has a super majority of support, he said.
Byrd said he expects the process to go quite smoothly. Supporters hope to get it on the November 2026 general election ballot, he said.
Rep. Ronald Stewart Jr., D-Tulsa, said the event is significant enough to be recognized with state day of remembrance.
Stewart said he recognizes that talking about historical events sometimes is met with resistance.
“In order to learn and progress from our history, the good, bad or the ugly, recognition such as this goes a long way in the healing process and the planning of our future,” Stewart said.

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Thousands of state government and community college employees in Washington have overwhelmingly ratified a new one-year contract that would secure raises they lost out on in July.
Nearly 5,300 members of the Washington Public Employees Association didn’t get a 3% pay hike other state workers received July 1 because they failed to approve their two-year deal in time for lawmakers to account for it in the state budget.
For the past three weeks, these state government and community college employees voted on separate tentative agreements. Both were approved by more than 90% of those who participated, the union announced Monday.
“We’re glad to have ratification done and this round of negotiations behind us,” association president Amanda Hacker said in an email. 
The next step is convincing state lawmakers and Gov. Bob Ferguson to fund the agreements in the 2026 supplemental budget they will craft next legislative session.
“While this latest agreement does not address the state’s ongoing failure to pay employees a fair wage, it will bring our members back up to parity with other state workers,” Hacker said. “We look forward to the legislature doing the right thing this time and funding all state employee contracts.”
Those affected work at 14 community colleges and in nine state agencies. Among them are the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Revenue, the Liquor and Cannabis Board and Department of Agriculture.
By law, public sector unions in Washington must approve a new contract by Oct. 1 to be considered by the governor for funding in the ensuing two-year budget.
The spending plan Ferguson signed in May funds multiple public employee union contracts with pay hikes of 3% on July 1 and 2% next July. These agreements contain other salary-related changes, including raising the starting wage for state workers to $18 an hour.
But last fall, Washington Public Employee Association members voted down their tentative agreement in pursuit of larger wage hikes. They didn’t get them, eventually ratifying an accord on April 3 with pay provisions mirroring those they’d rejected earlier. 
The legislative session ended three weeks later.
This time around, if the two contracts ratified Monday are funded, they will take effect at the start of the next fiscal year on July 1, 2026, and cover the second year of the biennium.
Most details in the agreements are the same. The primary difference concerns who is eligible to receive back pay.
State government employees would get the 3% bump paid retroactively and a 2% increase on July 1, 2026. Workers who depart before next July will receive retroactive compensation for the hours worked in this fiscal year.
Under the deal with community college employees, those working on July 1, 2026, would receive retroactive pay. Anyone who is laid off, loses their job due to a disability, or retires would also be eligible for the back pay. But those who leave on their own before the start of the contract would not be eligible for any back pay.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_2227-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-15 17:56:46.537810

One-third of Rhode Islanders are now facing the steepest annual health insurance premium hikes in more than a decade. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Even after cutting $59 million from what health insurers requested, 170,000 Rhode Islanders will shoulder the steepest annual premium hikes in more than a decade, the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King said Monday.
King’s bleak conclusion came in tandem with the office’s approval of 2026 commercial premiums, following a four-month review process.
“There’s no sugar-coating this,” King said in an interview. “It’s going to produce financial hardship for people. Unless we can get the costs of hospitals and physicians and drugs under control, I worry we’re going to see more of this.”

The annual balancing act between rising expenses cited by insurance companies as justification for rate increases, and out-of-pocket costs for one-third of the state’s residents, is never easy. (Self-funded insurance in which employers assume the financial risk for the medical costs are not subject to state review on rate hikes). But this year’s calculations were more difficult than unusual, King said.
“To be totally frank with you, I think we’re at an inflection point right now, and I think we need to be proactive to ensure that these high, double-digit increases don’t become the new normal,” King said
The state health insurance commissioner is required by law to guard the solvency of insurance companies, which in turn affects payments to hospitals and health care providers. But the commissioner also cannot legally approve a requested rate hike that is not in the public’s interest. 
“It’s not about just giving [insurers] what they need,” King said. “It’s trying to balance the delivery system, insurers and consumers with an ever decreasing ability to pay.”
Farewell to ACA federal tax credits
And this year, one big pain point for insurers and customers is out of King’s control: the Dec. 31 expiration to federal tax credits under the Affordable Care Act. The decision by Congress not to extend the discounts will spike average annual household insurance costs by 85%, or $1,250 a year, for 40,000 people in Rhode Island, according to HealthSource RI, which runs the state marketplace. As premiums rise, HealthSource estimates 13,000 people will be unable to afford coverage, or opt to forgo it — the latter mostly younger, healthier and more comfortable taking the risk. That in turn increases the concentration of older, sicker — and more medically expensive — people left for insurers to cover.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island — the two commercial insurers who provide coverage to people who buy insurance through the state marketplace — pointed to the expiring federal subsidies as justification for a large chunk of their requested premium hikes. 
Starting in January, a new fee included in the Rhode Island General Assembly’s fiscal 2026 budget will increase insurance premiums by $50 per person per year — or $200 for a family of four. When insurers submitted their proposed 2026 rate hikes in May, the budget was still in its drafting phase, and the health services assessment fee had not yet surfaced.










There’s no sugar-coating this. It’s going to produce financial hardship for people. Unless we can get the costs of hospitals and physicians and drugs under control, I worry we’re going to see more of this.


– Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King


Incorporating this policy change, along with other state mandates and economic factors, King arrived at modified premium hikes that still mark double-digit increases over the previous year.
For the 36,167 marketplace enrollees covered by Neighborhood, costs will rise 20.5% — less than 1 percentage point less than the 21.2% increase the company requested. 
Blue Cross marketplace rates will rise 22% for its 18,172 enrollees, nearly seven percentage points less than what the insurer requested.
Both companies indicated in separate statements that they accepted OHIC’s decision while continuing to stress the financial pressures they face, which in turn affect their payments to hospital and health care providers, weighing down their balance sheets. 
Blue Cross estimates its own costs have risen 20% over the last two years as drugs and services become more expensive, along with state-mandated spending. A new state requirement calling for a 30% boost to commercial reimbursement rates to primary care providers starting in January accounted for another fifth of Blue Cross’ requested increase.
“We understand the impact that rising healthcare costs have on our members and the importance of ensuring access to high-quality care,” Rich Salit, a Blue Cross spokesperson, said Monday. “That’s why we are working hard to manage costs through operational efficiencies, improved care management, and collaboration with state leaders, hospitals, and other providers on solutions to improve healthcare affordability.”
Elizabeth McClaine, vice president of commercial products for Neighborhood, noted that its individual market plan remains the least costly in the state. 
“We take this responsibility seriously and remain committed to providing accessible, cost-effective, and equitable health care for all our members,” McClaine said. 
On average, Affordable Care Act marketplace insurers have proposed raising premiums by 26% next year, according to an analysis by KFF of 312 insurers across 50 states and D.C. The proposed rate hikes range widely, from over 50% by five separate insurance companies in Arkansas, to a 10% drop by one Pennsylvania marketplace insurer. 
In Massachusetts, proposed rates by marketplace participants ranged from 7-12%, while Connecticut insurers requested increases of 4.7% to 28.6% for marketplace plans.
The AG vs. his expert 
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha denounced commercial insurers during the review process, urging King for the fourth consecutive year to reject requested rate hikes completely. For the first time this year, Neronha tapped a Brown University health economist, Christopher Whaley, to help make his case to King’s office.
The OHIC decision directly quoted from Whaley’s testimony in its announcement of the rate decisions noting that Whaley called the state’s review process “important” and “effective.”
King said he included Whaley’s direct testimony as a way to respond to Neronha, who previously characterized the state rate review process as “illegitimate” and overly conciliatory to insurance companies. 
“I take exception with that characterization of our rate review, and apparently his expert does too,” King said. 
Neronha was not budging.
 “As I’ve said countless times, Rhode Islanders deserve a health care system that can sustainably address their care needs,” Neronha said in a statement Monday. “And yet, year after year, the Health Insurance Commissioner continues to approve higher rates without evidence that these rate increases are helping to improve the system in which Rhode Island consumers are being forced to invest.”
Meanwhile, Gov. Dan McKee has entered the chat, urging King to consider a more “aggressive” review of health insurance costs, and ways to minimize them, in the year ahead. 
“Affordability and access to health insurance and healthcare impacts the quality of life of all Rhode Islanders and our economic growth,” McKee wrote in the Monday letter to King. “We must make the changes necessary to contain and prevent increased health insurance premiums to avoid Rhode Islanders becoming uninsured or underinsured.”
McKee suggested a temporary moratorium on new, unfunded health insurance mandates such as what lawmakers enacted in the 2026 budget, as well as a new cap on some of the cost factors, such as administrative charges. 
King said he agreed with McKee’s ideas, though his decision already incorporates some of McKee’s recommendations, including a first-time veto of any increases tied to insurance companies’ administrative expenses. OHIC also rejected companies’ pitches for more money in anticipation of tariff-related financial fallout on drug costs, noting the impacts remained hypothetical. 
The rate approvals announced Monday also trimmed requested increases by insurers in the small and large-group markets. 
The 42,865 enrolled in small-group plans will see 2026 premiums rise by 17.6% on average, versus the 22% average increase requested by Blue Cross, Neighborhood, and UnitedHealthcare of New England. Large group market plans, which cover 77,654 people, will increase 19.3% on average, compared with the 24.1% average requested increase. Insurers who cover large-group plans include BlueCross, UnitedHealth, Harvard Pilgrim, Aetna and Cigna.

(Photo by Matt Rourke/The Associated Press)Now that Attorney General James Uthmeier says that the open carrying of firearms is Florida law, a coalition of Second Amendment groups are warning lawmakers not to weaken it in any implementing legislation they may present when the Legislature convenes next year.
A three-judge panel of the Florida First District Court of Appeal (DCA) ruled last week that the state’s 1987 law banning open carry in Florida is unconstitutional. In the immediate aftermath, various law enforcement agencies throughout the state announced that they would no longer enforce the law, while others said that they were still studying the ruling and would not change existing policy — in some cases because the decision made by the First DCA only applied to 32 counties under its jurisdiction, mostly in North Florida.
Uthmeier clarified on Monday that the legal decision applies to every part of the state.
“Because no other appellate court has considered the constitutionality of Florida’s open carry ban since the SCOTUS decision in Bruen, the 1st DCA’s decision is binding on all Florida’s trial courts,” he said on X. “Meaning that as of last week, open carry is the law of the state.”
No ‘new restrictions’, Second Amendment groups say
Second Amendment groups that have been advocating for the Legislature to repeal the ban on open carry are cheering last week’s ruling. But they’re also warning state legislators not to add any new regulations in legislation they offer next year putting open carry into statute.
“Florida Carry (FLC), Gun Owners of America (GOA), National Rifle Association (NRA), and Florida Gun Rights (FLGR) all have spent countless dollars and man hours in this fight, that they have now won,” said Luis Valdes, Florida state director of Gun Owners of America in a statement.
“These organizations stand united in solidarity that any new restrictions on this right or to limit the impact of this VICTORY, will be vigorously and strongly opposed by a unified front of Florida gun owners and the members of these four organizations.”
“Member of Florida Gun Rights stand united and strong against any potential infringements on the recent ruling which declared Florida’s ban on open carry as unconstitutional,” said Logan Edge with Florida Gun Rights in a statement texted to the Phoenix.
“The legislature remains a hostile opponent against gun rights and open carry, but after many years of pushback, gun owners gained a massive victory in the courts,” he added. “We will make sure every Tallahassee legislator hears from gun rights activists and oppose any effort to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.”
Potential legislation with holster retention levels
What some gun rights group don’t want the Legislature to do in any implementing bill is to include what are known as holster retention levels for individuals carrying firearms on their person — they want no restrictions at all. There are four levels of restraint or retention, according to concealedcarry-ed.

Level 1 – holsters keep the gun in the holster through friction only.
Level 2 – holsters use friction plus an additional restraint. This restraint could be a thumb strap, a flip-up strap, an automatic lock, or some other device.
Level 3 – holsters use friction plus two additional restraints.
Level 4 – holsters use friction plus three additional restraints.

“Gun owners of America is extremely proud of this court victory finally securing our Second Amendment rights and we want to make sure that Florida does not go through the same issues that happened in New York after their win with the Bruen decision,” Valdes said in a written statement sent to the Phoenix. “After Bruen, the NY Legislature passed gun control to weaken that ruling, and we want to make sure that the same does not happen here in Florida.”
Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in NYSRPA v. Bruen in 2022, the Democratic-controlled New York Legislature approved and Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed legislation strengthening that state’s gun laws and adding restrictions on concealed carry weapons.
With Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis an advocate of open carry, he isn’t likely to sign off on any legislation that would weaken the state’s new policy.
Uthmeier emphasized on Monday that while the DCA’s decision repealing the ban is now state law, that the decision did not affect another part of Florida law that bans the open carrying of a handgun or concealed weapon in a number of public places.
Those places include any law enforcement agency; courtroom; prison; jail; polling place; government meeting; school, college, or professional athletic event; elementary or secondary school facility; airport; or establishment that dispenses alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises.
The same holds true for private property owners, who maintain the right to prohibit individuals carrying guns from their premises, Uthmeier said.
In a statement issued later on Monday, Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said that while she has a “long history” of advocating for Second Amendment rights, she believes the First DCA “erred” in last week’s opinion.
“Nationwide, we are seeing harrowing levels of gun violence, marked by assassinations, school shootings, and people being killed in places of worship,” she said.
“This is a moment in history when we need to promote safer environments, not embolden those who could abuse the ruling’s intent to sow seeds of terror.  We strongly encourage law enforcement to wait for a final legal judgment before allowing open carry, as it may cause confusion that leads to danger at a time when calm and clarity are so desperately needed.”

The umbrella term “school choice” centers on programs that offer alternatives to one’s assigned public school.The agency also said it’s investing more than $160 million total in American history and civics grants — a $137 million increase in the funds Congress previously approved. In its announcement, the agency said “these investments will be repurposed from programs that the Department determined are not in the best interest of students and families.” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said her department “has carefully scrutinized our federal grants, ensuring that taxpayers are not funding racially discriminatory programs but those programs which promote merit and excellence in education,” in a statement Monday. She added that the administration “will use every available tool to meaningfully advance educational outcomes and ensure every American has the opportunity to succeed in life.” There was no breakdown made available Monday as to which programs or individual institutions would gain funding.HBCU ‘godsend’Lodriguez V. Murray, senior vice president for public policy and government affairs at UNCF, which supports historically Black colleges and universities, said the extra funding is “nothing short of a godsend for HBCUs,” in a statement Monday.   “We are grateful to have worked with the Trump Administration, Secretary McMahon, and her Department of Education team in achieving this one-time infusion of grant funding,” Murray said.  Murray noted that “HBCUs are currently and have been underfunded since their inception” and “while we are grateful for these funds, we are still under-resourced.” The National Center for Education Statistics noted that in 2022, there were “99 HBCUs located in 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.”",,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

Therefore, they contend, the map passed by lawmakers should be declared void.
In the first of what promises to be extensive legal wrangling over the new maps, Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh heard arguments in a case that contends lawmakers should never have met at all. Filed by the NAACP as the special session began, attorney Sharon Jones argued Monday afternoon that the litigation should not be thrown out just because the session is already over.
There are, she said, questions that should be answered about the governor’s power to convene the legislature.
“We are in a position where new maps are going to have to be prepared, where legal challenges are already ongoing based on the legislation that passed,” Jones said. “The harms, because of what we believe to be an improperly called extraordinary session, continue to march, and that’s why we’re still seeking the preliminary injunction and the temporary restraining order.
Limbaugh did not rule immediately and did not estimate how long he would take.

Opposing the lawsuit, state Solicitor General Louis Capozzi said the case should be dismissed as moot because the legislature has met and adjourned. If that isn’t enough to dismiss the case, he said, the inherently political nature of a special session decision gives the governor broad discretion.
The Missouri Constitution says the governor can call lawmakers into session on “extraordinary occasions” after naming the items “on which action is deemed necessary.”
“Plaintiffs want this court to second guess the governor on what constitutes an extraordinary occasion,” Capozzi said. “There’s no precedent to guide the court on that open-ended inquiry, no cases at all. It’s an inherently political and policy focused decision, and without any precedent to guide the court, the court should not start down that path.”
Over 10 days ending Friday, the General Assembly met and passed two bills responding to Kehoe’s call to revise congressional maps and pass a proposal making it harder to pass constitutional amendments by initiative petition.
The revised congressional district map is intended to flip the 5th District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat, to Republican control.
Barring court action or a referendum petition to delay it, the new maps will take effect Dec. 11 and be used for elections in 2026. The proposal on initiatives will be on the November 2026 ballot unless Kehoe designates it for an election at an earlier date.
The NAACP lawsuit initially sought to block the legislature from meeting at all. Now the civil rights organization is asking that the legislature’s actions be declared invalid.
Jones admitted that no court has ever done what the NAACP is asking Limbaugh to do.
“There have been some cases that are about how far the legislature can go under (during a special session) but not how far the governor can go,” she said.
Along with the NAACP lawsuit filed as the session began, two additional lawsuits have been filed since the General Assembly adjourned. Both challenge the constitutionality of revising congressional district lines other than immediately after a federal census.
One, filed in Jackson County, alleges that lawmakers put the same Kansas City precinct into two districts, “creating a map that is malapportioned and/or noncontiguous.” The other, filed in Cole County, challenges the new map by questioning the power of the legislature to act between censuses.
The NAACP filed an updated petition Sunday, recognizing that the legislature had already met and adjourned after passing the bills Kehoe wanted.
“The court should require a minimum showing of some set of circumstances or events outside of the normal course of business to justify the convening of the legislature in an extraordinary session,” the revised filing states.
All the main questions raised by the NAACP are moot and the validity of the legislation is being tested in other courts, Capozzi wrote in a filing to the court seeking dismissal of the lawsuit.
And, he noted, the redistricting power is not limited to a particular time by the Constitution.
“Nothing prohibits the General Assembly from adopting a new federal congressional map mid-decade,” Capozzi wrote. “The Missouri Constitution is simply silent on that question. And where the Missouri Constitution is silent on a challenged legislative power, the General Assembly has the discretion to act.”
The question of whether a governor can call a special session is not purely political, Jones said.
“We are not talking about a question that is purely one of discretion,” Jones said. “We are talking about a question of how far does constitutional authority go.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_colecountycourt2-scaled-e1757967844893-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate has dismissed a lawsuit that sought to make the Cabinet for Health and Family Services implement a 2024 unfunded law and cooperate with a related investigation. 
This ruling comes four months after Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball sued over Senate Bill 151, the unfunded 2024 law that was drafted to help kinship care families but hasn’t been implemented due to a $20 million funding dispute between the legislative and executive branches of government. 
That law — on paper but not yet in reality — allows relatives who take temporary custody of a child, when abuse or neglect is suspected, to later become eligible for foster care payments. 
In October 2024 Ball launched an investigation into the cabinet’s ability to implement the law and alleged in her May lawsuit that the cabinet wouldn’t cooperate with that fact-finding mission. Then, she sued to gain access to information for the investigation and asked the court to force implementation of the law. 
‘Shame on you:’ Kentucky auditor’s standing questioned in kinship care lawsuit

In his Monday ruling Wingate found that the cabinet “has not failed to respond and has not refused to comply to the same degree as that found” in case law and that “no subpoenas have been sought, CHFS has complied with many of the auditor’s requests, and, finally, CHFS has asserted that the auditor ‘need only provide a name and CHFS will set up an interview just as it always has.’” 
Wingate also said Ball “has not yet exhausted administrative means to obtain documents and the matter has not yet ripened into a concrete dispute.” 
Norma Hatfield, the president of the Kinship Families Coalition of Kentucky who is also raising two grandchildren, said she’s “very frustrated” by the ongoing dispute, which she called “political game play.” 
“I don’t know how this can be happening a couple years later,” Hatfield told the Lantern. “It’s like we’re on a train that doesn’t have any stops.”  
An auditor’s office spokesperson said Ball has “directed the issuance of subpoenas as the necessary next step to protect Kentucky’s kinship caregivers and the children in their care.” 
The auditor has 30 days to decide if she wishes to appeal the ruling.

Gov. Andy Beshear, who was previously dismissed from the lawsuit, said in a Monday statement that the “dismissal of this unfounded lawsuit proves that Team Kentucky isn’t letting politics get in the way of doing what’s right.” 
“My administration has always prioritized the safety and wellbeing of Kentucky’s children, and we’re committed to working with any office to see that goal through,” Beshear said in a statement. “Implementing Senate Bill 151 requires more funding, yet the General Assembly failed to do so in both the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions.”
Ball said in a statement that she will “remain committed to fighting to ensure these families get the resources they rightfully deserve” and that the subpoenas she’s preparing “will reveal the truth about the actual cost and all available resources to fund this program.” 
Kentucky’s kinship care landscape 
In 2024, there were around 55,000 Kentucky children being raised with a non-parent relative, according to a report from Kentucky Youth Advocates. These families often make hasty decisions about taking in their minor relative that leaves them without needed financial support. 
When the state removes a child from a home, grandparents and other family members often choose to take temporary custody rather than have the child go into state custody. State custody is the first step toward foster care. That first decision is permanent under current law which has excluded kinship caregivers who take temporary custody from ever receiving the $750 a month that foster parents receive for each child, the Lantern has reported.
Senate Bill 151 is supposed to give kinship caregivers 120 days to apply to become foster parents for their minor relatives and allows children who are being removed from homes to request their preferred familial caregivers, if they are able.

Hatfield, the kinship caregiver and advocate, said this whole ordeal has left her with some distrust of the state government. 
“This is a problem that is across the board, with the legislators and the cabinet and the governor, and we need to solve that,” she said. “I don’t have a lot of faith, right now, in the process. I just feel like the people that could make that better — all of them — need to get to the table and — let’s start problem solving.” 
Meanwhile, she said, kinship care families are left out to dry. 
“I just know there’s a big, big problem here, and as a result, the people needing to be served are being ignored,” Hatfield said. “We know we can do something different for these kids and those families, and we’re not. And it just covers me with sadness.”

When Dallas Kelly received a Book Award scholarship to St. Michael’s College, the standout student faced a tough decision: follow her dream to a big-city school or make the more affordable choice. As her journey unfolded, she discovered that choosing affordability didn’t have to mean giving up on her dreams.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dream school me[...]","As Dallas Kelly wrapped up her Junior year at Hartford High School, she had big college dreams. She saw herself at a huge state school with tens of thousands of students in a big city that offered a world of opportunity. “I idolized college in my mind. I was looking for something big and different, something to push and challenge me,” she recalls. 
Then, at an end-of-year awards assembly, the standout student from Sharon received the St. Michael’s College Book Award, which came with a hefty scholarship to the small school in Colchester, Vermont. While she was honored and very grateful for the award, she also began her senior-year college process with a big decision weighing on her: “Do I go to one of my ‘dream schools’ that I don’t know much about, that’s also really expensive? Or do I go to a local college where I could go for virtually nothing?”
Having participated in VSAC’s Talent Search college and career planning program since her sophomore year at Hartford, Dallas was prepared for the college process, even though none of her parents—her mom, her stepdad or her dad—went to college. According to her VSAC Outreach Counselor, Beth Clay, “Dallas worked really hard her senior year, applying for every possible scholarship and grant, and she advocated for herself with many institutions.” Midway through her senior year, she had been accepted to several schools, and it came down to the numbers. 
“VSAC was incredibly helpful. Beth knew how to run the numbers for me, knew the programs, knew the alternatives, knew every possible path I could take to get me where I wanted to be,” says Dallas, who loves children and hopes to work as a pediatric speech-language pathologist or a behavioral interventionist, perhaps specializing in children on the autism spectrum or recovering from trauma. 
“Beth also knew what I needed. She always encouraged me, but she was also realistic. Having real numbers in front of me was so helpful. It helped me not idolize college anymore because the financial reality was in front of me. Without VSAC, I would have been lost in the figures. I’m incredibly grateful that I had that resource.” 
But for several months, Dallas still worried that if she chose the most financially sustainable path, she might be giving up on her dreams. She asked a lot of people for advice, especially those who had gone through the same decision process a year or two earlier. 
As the second youngest of four children, Dallas turned to one of her older brothers, who had to pivot on his own college plan when the school he chose—Johnson and Wales in Miami, Florida—shut down during COVID. “He said he knew I would make anywhere the place I wanted to be once I got there.”  
The others she turned to offered advice on both sides, from “go where you love” to “the dream college isn’t worth it; you’ll find joy and opportunity anywhere you go.” 
In the end, a chance encounter during a visit to St. Michael’s College sealed the deal.
“I went to visit St. Mike’s, and there was this girl I went to middle school with. I had always seen her as this vibrant, social, exuberant person who I could see loving the city life, so I was surprised to see her at this small school. I asked her how she ended up there, and she said she got an amazing scholarship. I asked her what she thought of that decision now. She said it was hard at the time to give up her ideal of the ‘dream school,’ but she had to make the smartest financial decision. She also told me, ‘If you want something, you will seek it out wherever you are. You will make it your home, and you won’t want to leave.’ That helped me a lot.” 
Now a sophomore at St. Mike’s, Dallas has done just that. She’s double majoring in elementary education and English and minoring in psychology. And her extracurricular calendar proves what she soon discovered: “Even though it’s a small school, there is so much to get involved in.”
Dallas is a hiking leader and is training to be a paddle sports instructor at the Adventure Sports Center, where students lead day hikes, rock climbs, and kayaking and mountain biking excursions. She picked up Ultimate Frisbee this year. She is the Class of 2028 representative on the honors program committee. She has an on-campus job. And she’s active with the DREAM mentorship program, where college students are paired with local kids from age 5 to 15 who come from modest-income families. Dallas will be taking on a leadership role with DREAM this year.
How does she manage it all? Strong friendships are key, Dallas says. “My roommates are well-organized and focused people, so we all keep each other on track,” she says with a laugh. 
Looking back on her journey, Dallas recalls something she heard often as she was weighing her college decision. “A lot of people told me, ‘Go to the school that will make you happy every day.’ Originally I thought that was one of my big-city dream schools,” Dallas says. “Now I realize those schools might have been exciting for every day of the first semester. But God knew my heart. He knew that what I needed from a school in order to call it my home was a tightknit community, access to some sort of a city, and most of all nature to explore. And that’s what St. Mike’s gives to me.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-15 20:16:38+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Immigrant detained despite work permit, no criminal history",Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/15/immigrant-detained-despite-work-permit-no-criminal-history/,Immigrant's detention in Mississippi may relate to recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing ICE stops based on race and ethnicity.,"“Wait here while I check your information. Everything will be alright.” 
That’s what Mario Reyes Rodas’ attorney said the federal immigration officer told his client the morning of Aug. 27 during a traffic stop along Interstate 20 in Rankin County. The Morton resident provided a current driver’s license and work authorization card that has allowed him to work as a landscaper while he sought permanent residence. 
Then came the questions. 
Where are you from? Mexico, Reyes Rodas answered. Do you have a visa or authorization to be in the country? No, the man replied, though he had been trying to obtain permanent residency for years. 
That was enough information for him to be detained, even though he has no criminal record. 
Reyes Rodas left his car on the side of the road as he was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He was taken to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Pearl to be processed and then to the Madison County Detention Center. Within a week, he was taken to River Correctional Center, an ICE facility in Ferriday, Louisiana.
“He hasn’t seen freedom since then,” said Jeremy Litton, who is representing Reyes Rodas in an ongoing immigration case. 
Reyes Rodas was charged with the civil violation of entry into the country without authorization, his attorney said. 
The 40-year-old father of two was not given a reason for his detainment, his attorney said, nor was there documentation of a warrant to arrest or detain him. 
Litton said his client also was not stopped that day under suspicion of violating a state law, such as speeding. 
Why, then, Litton wondered, was Reyes Rodas detained. A week and a half later came a potential answer. 
On Sept. 8, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal immigration officers can stop people without reasonable suspicion based on their apparent race or ethnicity, if they speak in Spanish or accented English, if they are in a place where undocumented immigrants are known to gather and if they work in specific jobs that undocumented people are known to work. 
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the Sept. 8 majority order that multiple considerations taken together “can constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.” 
In her dissent, Justice Sonya Sotomayor argued the Trump administration has declared all Latinos regardless of U.S. citizenship who fit those criteria “are fair game to be seized at any time.” 
Reyes Rodas isn’t the only person detained who doesn’t have a criminal background. 
As of September, 70% of all people held in immigration detention centers around the country have no criminal convictions, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse immigration data by Syracuse University. Of those with criminal convictions, many committed minor offenses such as traffic violations. 
A spokesperson from Customs and Border Protection confirmed the detention of Reyes Rodas and that he was turned over to Immigration and Custom Enforcement for removal processing. An ICE spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. 
Federal immigration agents have conducted immigration enforcement along I-20, including in March and May that resulted in at least 70 arrests and seizure of firearms and ammunition.  
Emmanuel Reyes, the eldest American-born son of Reyes Rodas, remembers finishing work on Aug. 27 when his girlfriend called. 
Don’t worry, she told him, but immigration officers picked up your father. Reyes said the news immediately sent him into a panic. 
Reyes said his father is a loving man of faith who has supported him and his 17-year-old brother, coming to every game, meet and match for the multi-sport athletes. 
His parents came to America 20 years ago to provide support for their family members in Mexico, and they stayed to give their sons a better life. Reyes said he and his brother have grown up aware of their U.S. citizenship and looked for ways to help their parents, including how to help them gain legal status. 
“My dad was trying to live for what he came here for, the American dream,” Reyes said. “ … They wanted to give us opportunities. It’s better here.”
Litton has represented Reyes Rodas since 2019, not long after he was one of more than 600 mostly Latino workers detained in raids at chicken processing plants in central Mississippi. 
That year, he filed an application requesting the dismissal of removal proceedings against Reyes Rodas, which is a defense available to those facing deportation who meet certain requirements, including a clean criminal record, continuous presence in the country for at least 10 years and potential hardship to his U.S. citizenship children if he were deported. 
Litton said the 42B application is a pathway to a green card: permanent residency that allows people to live and work in the United States.   
As they waited for the application to be processed, Litton said Reyes Rodas applied and received authorization to work, which is valid through 2029. That document enabled him to get a Mississippi driver’s license.  
It took several years for Reyes Rodas to be issued notice to appear in immigration court to be able to file the 42B application. His first court date scheduled in 2021 was delayed several times, Litton said. 
By 2023 as they prepared for the hearing, Litton looked up the case and found it was gone, which he said is something that has happened in a handful of other cases relating to the poultry raids. 
Reyes Rodas had a court date scheduled for Tuesday with the LaSalle Immigration Court in Jena, Louisiana. But like his earlier case, the date disappeared off the court calendar, Litton said he learned Friday afternoon. 
As a result, Litton plans to request a bond hearing to argue that Reyes Rodas had valid work authorization and a pending immigration application when he was detained and mention the administrative challenges with his case.  
However, Reyes Rodas may not be able to receive it in light of a recent Board of Immigration Appeals decision stating that immigration judges lack the authority to approve or hear bond requests for those already in the country without authorization. 
Litton said it’s “indefinite detention” for anyone, regardless of when they entered the country.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/15151202/Reyes-Rodas-family-photo-recent-edit-2.jpg,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

The recent string of crashes began Aug. 10, when a box truck hit Highway Patrol Trooper Dennis Ricks during an early morning traffic stop in Orangeburg. Ricks died from his injuries three days later.

Around midnight Sept. 7, a truck hit Senior Trooper Mitchell Williams with its side mirror on Interstate 77 near Columbia. Williams went to a local hospital and was released the same day, according to the Department of Public Safety. Two days later, Master Trooper Wayne LaBounty was airlifted to a hospital after being hit during a traffic stop in Lexington County, according to the department.
LaBounty is still in the hospital in stable condition, said Col. Christopher Williamson, commander of the state Highway Patrol.
Any driver passing an emergency vehicle, tow truck or construction crew stopped on the side of the road must “significantly reduce the speed” of their car and switch lanes if possible under a 1996 law known as the Move Over Law.
That law is often difficult for single troopers to enforce, since they are typically busy with whatever drew them to the side of the road in the first place. Through Friday, the Highway Patrol will send cars out in pairs for “Operation Keep Us Safe.”
That way, when one trooper makes a traffic stop, the other can monitor other drivers and pursue anyone who fails to slow down or move over, Williamson said.
Violators will receive a fine of between $300 and $500, according to the law.
Williamson has asked every sheriff’s department in the state to be similarly diligent about ticketing people who fail to yield for emergency vehicles this week.
Flashing messages on the state’s highways will read “See flashing lights, move over. It’s the law.”
The goal of the weeklong “blitz,” as Williamson called it, is to remind drivers of the law, he said.
Too many people are either distracted while driving and miss the emergency lights or don’t care enough to pull over, Williamson said.

The trend of drivers not following the Move Over Law has been happening for much longer than a month, he said.
Earlier this year, the Department of Public Safety reminded drivers of the importance of slowing down and moving away from law enforcement after two near-misses in less than two weeks.
On June 4, as a trooper spoke with the driver of a stopped car in Dorchester County, another car plowed into the scene, narrowly missing the state trooper and sending the parked car careening off the road, according to a video the department released of the incident. Ten days later, another video showed a trooper in Richland County leaping over a guardrail to avoid a car that lost control near the scene of another accident.
Williamson stopped short of asking for a change in law Monday, pleading instead with the public to follow what’s already in place or face the penalties.
“I don’t know how to get through to people to care about what’s going on outside of their phones, their own vehicles and their own world,” Williamson said. “What I do know is that their lack of attention, their lack of good judgment and their lack of regard for other human lives has got to stop.”
Workers who must stop on the side of the road understand their jobs come with some level of risk, but it’s up to drivers to minimize the chance of harming them, Williamson said.
“What we didn’t sign up for is a blatant disregard for our safety that seems to be running rampant,” Williamson said. “There’s only so much our troopers can do to control the conditions and environment on the side of an interstate with vehicles flying by at speeds often higher than the posted speed limits.”
If one of those cars loses control, the result can be devastating for the troopers and their families.
Master Trooper Devin Kugler, for instance, always takes an extra look over his shoulder when making traffic stops after a crash left him with brain injuries, broken bones, nerve damage and hearing loss.

Kugler was preparing to perform a sobriety test on the side of a Greenville County road when a car hit him. The driver who struck him pleaded guilty to hit-and-run charges in 2023 and was sentenced to five years in prison.
Many people zoom past emergency lights without causing a collision, so they think there’s no reason to slow down, especially if they’re in a hurry, Kugler said. But slowing down often adds just a few extra seconds to a commute and could save a life, he said.
“We’ve got to put forth that extra effort,” he said.
Lois Rao echoed his plea. Every time she hears about another trooper injured or killed on the side of the road, she thinks of her son, Michael Rao.
He was on the side of a Clarendon County road helping a stranded driver when a pickup truck struck him at 81 miles per hour. Rao died from his injuries two days later, in June 2002. The pickup driver pleaded guilty to reckless homicide and spent five years on probation.
More than two decades later, Lois Rao still chokes up when talking about her son.
“The Move Over Law does save lives,” Rao said. “Do not subject another mother to bury her son.”
Although the targeted enforcement effort will last only a week, drivers should continue to expect tickets for disobeying the law after this week, Williamson said.
Officers will also more strictly enforce the hands-free driving law that went into effect Sept. 1. Until February, anyone caught holding a cellphone while driving will receive a warning, officials said.
“After Friday, I hope that the broader public don’t think that we are just going away,” Williamson said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4363-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

WILMINGTON – The Delaware Community Foundation (DCF) announced a five-year, $13.1 million investment in the Delaware Center for Cognitive Aging Research (DECCAR) at the University of Delaware (UD) through its Paul H. Boerger Fund.
“This transformational gift will significantly expand Alzheimer’s research throughout the state,” said Director of DECCAR and Associate Professor of Kinesiology and Applied Physiology Christopher Martens.
The planned investment, one of the largest in Delaware’s history for Alzheimer’s research, aims to accelerate studies focused on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
“No one has to look very far afield to witness and understand the tragedy of Alzheimer’s, and the research supported by this grant will help UD researchers come ever-closer to uncovering life-improving and life-saving solutions,” said DCF President and CEO Stuart Comstock-Gay. “The grant was provided through the generosity of late Paul H. Boerger, who made a substantial legacy gift to the fund he had established at the DCF in his lifetime, and his foresight will help so many.”
Legacy of Paul H. Boerger
The Paul H. Boerger Fund was created in 2014 and received an estate gift following Boerger’s death in 2017. His wish was that the fund support research to prevent and/or cure Alzheimer’s disease. In 2023, the fund awarded $575,000 to DECCAR to launch the Delaware Longitudinal Study for Alzheimer’s Prevention (DeLSAP), which explores how health, lifestyle, and biology influence dementia risk and helps identify early signs of impairment.
Following the study’s success, DCF invited DECCAR to submit a new proposal, resulting in the $13.1 million commitment.

“This transformational gift will significantly expand Alzheimer’s research throughout the state,” Martens said. “It will also help grow the number of researchers in Delaware focused on Alzheimer’s disease, promoting an interdisciplinary approach.”
University Partnership
Interim UD President Laura Carlson emphasized the impact of the foundation’s support.
“Every one of us has a family member or friend who has been deeply affected by Alzheimer’s. I’m proud that UD is working better to understand this terrible disease and partnering with others throughout the state to work on its prevention, diagnosis and treatment,” Carlson said. “We are grateful to the Delaware Community Foundation for their support which allows us to escalate our research and expand our community outreach.”

An Iowa judge has fined the Pennsylvania insurance commissioner $481,500 for contempt of court after finding that she deliberately violated a court order in a civil case brought by Iowa’s insurance regulators.
The civil penalty marks the latest development in a long-running legal dispute between the insurance commissioners of Iowa and Pennsylvania.
In 2022, Iowa Insurance Commissioner Douglas Ommen sought an injunction against the financially struggling Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania, or SHIP, arguing the company intended to “coerce vulnerable Iowans” into paying confiscatory rate increases of 400% or more for their long-term care insurance policies, even while imposing “draconian” cuts in benefits.

At the time, Ommen said SHIP, which had sold long-term care insurance policies to more than 880 Iowans, was financially insolvent with a $1.3 billion funding shortfall. Because of the company’s financial condition, control over SHIP had been handed over to a so-called “special deputy rehabilitator,” Patrick Cantilo, and to the Pennsylvania insurance commissioner.
The injunction, which was later granted, barred Cantilo and the Pennsylvania commissioner from offering any rates, riders or policy documents to any Iowa policyholders that had not been previously authorized and approved by the Iowa insurance commissioner.
In January 2025, SHIP informed the Iowa insurance commissioner the company had filed a request with the commonwealth court of Pennsylvania to begin implementing a court-approved “rehabilitation plan” for the company, allowing SHIP to contact Iowa policyholders and to offer, or in some cases force, changes to their policies.
The Iowa commissioner then informed SHIP that even if the Pennsylvania court granted the request and the company followed through, it would be in clear violation of the injunction issued in Iowa. Under that scenario, the commissioner warned, he would authorize the Iowa attorney general to seek sanctions against SHIP.
According to court filings by the Iowa insurance commissioner, SHIP “did not back down” and, in April 2025, more than 480 SHIP policyholders in Iowa became the target of a mass mailing informing them of potential modifications to their policies.
The Iowa commissioner then sought a contempt finding against SHIP, Cantilo and the Pennsylvania insurance commissioner.
Judge: Defendants ‘orchestrated’ Pennsylvania order
Jospeh Gamble, one of the attorneys representing SHIP, the Pennsylvania commissioner and Castilo, argued in court filings that by offering Iowa policyholders the option of choosing the manner in which their benefits might be reduced, the defendants had been acting in the policyholders’ best interests.
The Iowa commissioner, Gamble asserted, was “seeking only to punish the defendants for their desire to provide the best possible outcomes for policyholders based on the input of those policyholders.”
Polk County District Court Judge Scott J. Beattie recently ruled in the Iowa commissioner’s favor, noting that a showing of contempt would require proof the defendants had acted intentionally and deliberately “with bad purpose, evil, or wanton disregard for the rights of others.”
The evidence, Beattie said, established beyond a reasonable doubt the defendants willfully and deliberately violated his injunction by pursuing “authorization” from the Pennsylvania court to take actions they knew were already prohibited by the Iowa injunction.
The defendants then notified Iowa policyholders of proposed rate and benefit changes, and asked policyholders to select rates or benefits other than those authorized by the Iowa commissioner.
The defendants’ argument that “they were merely following a Pennsylvania court order does not excuse their contempt,” Beattie found. “Defendants orchestrated and requested the Pennsylvania court order with full knowledge it would violate this court’s injunction.”
Beattie found that each of the letters sent to SHIP’s 481 current Iowa policyholders constituted 481 separate acts of contempt of court. Similarly, a May 2025 mailing from SHIP directly the Iowa policyholders constituted an additional 481 acts of contempt, Beattie ruled.
Beattie assessed the defendants a $500 civil penalty for pursuing the Pennsylvania court order, plus a $500 civil penalty for each of the two letters SHIP or its representatives sent the 481 Iowa policyholders, for a total penalty of $481,500.
That penalty, Beattie ruled, is to be paid jointly by Jessica K. Altman in her official capacity as Pennsylvania’s insurance commissioner, and by Patrick Cantilo, the special deputy rehabilitator. Additional sanctions may be imposed for any future violations, Beattie warned.
Iowan paid $107 per month for 27 years
In his ruling, Beattie cited testimony from Janet Galloway Huston, a 75-year-old retired attorney from Iowa. Huston had testified that she maintained her SHIP policy for long-term care since January 1998, paying $107 per month in premiums for over 27 years without ever receiving benefits under the policy.
Her policy, she testified, was to provide $253 per day for either assisted living or nursing facility care. Because assisted-living care in the Des Moines area costs $8,500 to $10,000 per month, she testified, her policy would cover roughly 60 percent of her actual costs.
Huston testified that she and her husband “went through a very massive financial structuring so that we could provide for ourselves. This was one of the pots, one of the ways that we could ensure our care in old age, and so it was definitely one of the pots that we elected to purchase the policy and relied on.”
In her testimony, Huston expressed anger upon receiving SHIP’s notification of a potential reductions in her benefits, explaining that “I do not have enough money in my current income and the other pots that I have available to me to sustain assisted living or long-term care” and would have to instead rely on Medicaid for her care.
“We relied upon the actuaries and the experts in the insurance field when my husband and I purchased these policies,” she testified. “We relied upon the expertise provided by the insurance company that these benefits would be there long term.”
The civil penalties imposed by Beattie deal only with the violations of the court’s temporary injunction. Still to be decided are the larger issues that gave rise to the Iowa commissioner’s lawsuit, which include allegations of violating Iowa insurance regulations.
A trial on those issues is currently scheduled for June 29, 2026.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-15 20:05:45+00:00,CT Mirror,US Army Corps cites progress clearing hydrilla in CT. What’s next?,John Moritz and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/15/hydrilla-done-0912/,"Officials say they’re turning the tide in a long-running fight against hydrilla — but to continue, the Army Corps needs additional funding.","For the first time since the highly-invasive aquatic weed hydrilla appeared on the Connecticut River in 2016, officials say they’ve begun to turn the tide in their long-running fight against it.
In a handful of locations along the river where the weed once grew in thick mats, attacks with chemical herbicides have reduced its prevalence to a few isolated clumps. 
In other areas, researchers with the United States Army Corps of Engineers are already planning for their next offensive — tentatively scheduled for next summer — by using tracer dyes to track the flow of water and determine precisely how much herbicide they need to use to target the weed while minimizing harm to other, native species of plants.
“It’s going to take time to control hydrilla, it’s not going to be like a one-and-done kind of treatment and then you walk away,” said Keith Hannon, the project manager for the Army Corps’ New England District. 
“There is reduced regrowth compared to previous years, but it is growing back,” Hannon added. “That’s why the work we’re doing here is going to be, hopefully, used to inform a larger management plan.” Hannon said local and state officials would then be able to deploy the plan to manage regrowth over the long term.

In order for the work to continue, however, Hannon said the Army Corps would need to receive additional funding that’s currently awaiting approval from Congress.
Researchers were forced to scale back their efforts earlier this year after lawmakers failed to include money for the Connecticut River hydrilla project in the latest government funding bill. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., has since requested an additional $5.5 million in funding for project as part of a cost-sharing program with state governments.
Blumenthal said Friday that he is seeking to include the money in the Senate’s annual Energy and Water Development bill, which is currently being held up amid a dispute over funding for clean energy programs.
“I have very strong hopes,” that the funding will be approved, Blumenthal said. “I’m optimistic because it’s a program that makes eminent good sense from an environmental and economic standpoint, and obviously it has strong support among the states most deeply affected.”

The project also faced a period of tumult this summer when a sudden controversy arose around one of the herbicides being used by researchers: diquat dibromide.
In a series of social media posts that quickly racked up thousands of views, opponents spread inaccurate information about diquat — a common herbicide that is widely used in aquatic applications — and accused officials of deceit despite several public meetings that were held to raise awareness about the project. Some of the posts leveled attacks against the researchers themselves, accusing of them of trying to “poison” the river.
As as result of that pushback, the Army Corps ended up extending delaying its work by several weeks in order to solicit more feedback from the public.
When the work resumed in August, officials said there was only enough time and federal funding available to apply herbicides in two locations along the river: the Chester Boat Basin and Selden Cove in Lyme.

Hydrilla is native to Eurasia, but has already spread across much of the Eastern Seaboard since it was spotted in Florida in the 1950s. The strain found in the Connecticut River, however, is genetically distinct from other varieties and is known to spread vigorously through fragments carried by currents, boats and boat trailers. 
Officials said they believe the plant may have been introduced to the river near Agawam, Mass., and spread south to the mouth of Long Island Sound as well as in several lakes and ponds.
The purpose of the Army Corps’ project is not to eradicate hydrilla from the river, but instead to gain a better understanding of which chemicals and methods work best at combating the strain so that those results may be replicated in other regions to stop it from spreading.
“If you don’t take care of it when it’s in a pond, next thing you know it’s in millions of acres,” said Ben Sperry, a Army Corps research biologist based in Gainesville, Florida, who traveled to Connecticut to oversee the project’s field work. “That’s the big concern if this thing starts to spread south. It has the capacity to replace other species.”
In addition to the Army Corps, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has also provided support for the project.
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, while not directly involved in the team’s research, is in charge of reviewing and issuing the permits necessary to apply herbicides within the state’s waterways.
“Generally speaking, DEEP supports efforts to curb the negative impacts of hydrilla and to educate the public about the ways they can assist in those efforts,” DEEP spokesman Will Healey said in a statement.
Early one sunny morning in late August, Sperry’s team of Army Corps researchers — including others who had traveled from as far away as Mississippi and the Great Lakes — arrived in Chester for the first day of treatments.
The team quickly got to work setting up several machines resembling the Star Wars droid R2-D2. Inside each of the machines was a revolving set of tubes to sample water in the basin every hour for up to a day to monitor for nutrients that are released by the plants as they begin to die and decompose.

Meanwhile, contractors for Solitude Lake Management, a private aquatic-management company based in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, began making back-and-forth sweeps across the basin, applying a diluted mixture of herbicides, including diquat, through hoses lowered underneath the surface.
The day after treating the boat basin, the team conducted similar work with another chemical herbicide, endothall, at Selden Cove. Sperry said researchers stayed in the area for several days to monitor the effects of the herbicide. After that, he said they’ll come back once a month — except when the river is frozen in the winter — for up to a year to conduct vegetation surveys.
During an online public meeting last month, the Corps reported the results from its vegetation surveys at four locations treated with herbicides in 2024, which showed large drop-offs in the amount of hydrilla and another invasive species, water chestnut.
Chester Basin, which was treated with a combination of endothall and diquat last year, saw a reduction in hydrilla while native plants pickerelweed, wild rice, and eelgrass were unaffected. The invasive plant cabomba, which is present at the site, is also resistant to diquat and would need to be managed by other methods, Sperry said.
Alicea Charamut, the executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut, a nonprofit conservation group, said that boaters in areas treated by the Army Corps have also reported clearer waterways — though she cautioned that “several years” of further data is needed to develop an effective management plan.
“Conditions change from year to year,” Charamut said. “I don’t think people truly understand how dynamic river systems are, especially tidal river systems like the Connecticut River… and to be able to understand, we need to have that consistent monitoring and data from year to year, to see how management, how effective it is.”
The final phase of the Army Corps’ work this summer involved a series of “practice runs” using inert dyes that mimic the spread of herbicide through a particular stretch of water.

During one such test at Portland Boat Works earlier this month, researchers set up seven data buoys along more than a mile of river to track the spread of the diluted dye being slowly released from a 60-gallon tank. 
Portland was one of four locations in Connecticut and Massachusetts where the dye studies are scheduled to take place through Sept. 19.
The location was also one of several where the Army Corps applied herbicides to combat hydrilla in 2024, but Sperry said that swift currents in the area prevented the chemicals from settling on the plants. “We didn’t get the level of control we were hoping for,” he said.
Armed with more data, he added, the team hoped to be able to tweak their methods and try again next summer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DIQUAT-SPRAYING-0820-DE-032-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin is urging a judge to dismiss a lawsuit the state public defender’s office filed to learn more about how state police use and store genetic evidence analyzed using “rapid DNA” technology.
The public defender’s office sued in July after learning during discovery in a criminal case that the state has maintained what the office called a secret database of rapid DNA evidence since 2021. Such storage risks civil rights abuses because it’s unregulated, was not authorized by legislators, and is largely unknown to the public, the lawsuit said. The office wants the internal memo it says “authorized” state police to create the database, but Platkin’s records custodians have refused to disclose it.
In a filing last week, Platkin argued that the public defender’s office already has a copy of the state police’s manual explaining how rapid-DNA tests are performed at crime scenes and police stations and how that genetic data then gets stored. So they don’t need the May 2021 internal memo, which was written by a lawyer with the state’s criminal justice division, the filing says.
That memo did not authorize rapid DNA and instead contains legal research and analysis addressing how law enforcement agencies should use rapid DNA technology and how criminal defendants could challenge its use, Platkin says. It’s a deliberative document and predated the attorney general’s July 2021 decision to green-light the use of rapid DNA, making it exempt from disclosure under the state’s Open Public Records Act, the state argued.
Platkin’s office also denied the public defender’s claim that people whose DNA winds up in the database don’t have a clear path to remove it.
“Disclosure would create a profound chilling effect on the government because agencies would no longer be assured that their internal deliberations are protected. Such result would be absurd,” the filing says.
The technology allows officers to get DNA results within about 90 minutes, bypassing backlogs and sometimes lengthy delays at DNA laboratories. Critics have questioned its accuracy, raising concerns about quality controls.

Bernie Sanders to try and rein in what they view as corporate greed by taxing excessive salaries for America’s top executives.
HR 5298, known as the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act, would raise taxes on corporations that pay their executives 50 times the wages of their workers. A news release circulated by Tlaib’s office said that if Tesla, X and SpaceX head Elon Musk, for example, receives the full $975 billion compensation package that Tesla’s board recently proposed, the company would – under her bill – owe up to $100 billion in additional taxes over the next decade.
“Working people are sick and tired of corporate greed. CEOs are now making 290 times more than their average worker,” Tlaib said in a statement. “It’s disgraceful that corporations continue to rake in record profits by exploiting the labor of their workers. Every worker deserves a living wage and human dignity on the job.”
Sanders, in a statement, said American workers can no longer tolerate a “rigged economy,” one that “enables the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, to become the first trillionaire while 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck and millions work longer hours for lower wages.” 
“It is unacceptable that the CEOs of the largest low-wage corporations make more than 630 times what their average workers make,” Sanders said. “This is not only morally obscene, but also insane economic policy. No society can survive when one man becomes a trillionaire while the working class is unable to afford basic necessities.”
The Democrats’ bill would also create penalties that would start at 0.5 percentage points for companies with CEO-to-worker pay ratios between 50-to-1 and 100-to-1, increasing to the highest rate for firms where executives make more than 500 times worker pay. The proposal would raise an estimated $150 billion over 10 years if current pay patterns continue.
It is unclear whether the bill has any momentum, as both chambers of Congress are controlled by Republicans, and with President Donald Trump in the White House.

Goldner
The letter, dated Sept. 15, states that Goldner’s term would conclude at 5 p.m. that evening. Goldner’s term ended officially on July 1 but he had continued to occupy the seat on a holdover basis. Ayotte’s decision to end his term was originally reported by WMUR.
Ayotte did not provide a reason for her decision in the letter, in a statement from her office sent via email on Monday, or in social media posts referencing the decision.
“Governor Ayotte thanks (Goldner) for his service to our state,” spokesperson John Corbett said in the statement. “The Governor’s Office has begun an immediate search for his replacement to ensure the regulatory process is transparent, accountable, and protects Granite Staters from rate hikes.”
New Hampshire Consumer Advocate Donald Kreis said he was not surprised by the decision. 
“The governor made her displeasure with Goldner pretty public,” Kreis said, pointing to Ayotte’s reaction to a ruling of the PUC in July granting rate increases to utility Eversource Energy. In a statement, Ayotte said at the time she was “extremely disappointed” in the outcome of the case. 
While Kreis said Goldner was “a thoughtful and respectful presence in the hearing room,” the commissioner’s business background showed in his leadership style and approach to regulation, according to Kreis. 
Goldner is an engineer and former business executive who worked for semiconductor and other electronics businesses for more than 30 years, according to a biography on the PUC website. His industry-insider approach sometimes made litigating before the PUC a challenge, Kreis said.
“I think Chairman Goldner had trouble understanding the difference between running a utility company and regulating a utility company,” Kreis said. “… When you’re the regulator, you’re better advised to let the stakeholders try to work with each other to address as much as they can by consensus.”
Goldner’s term on the PUC also began controversially, with critics accusing him of denying climate change and not being sufficiently familiar with clean energy technology after he was nominated by former Gov. Chris Sununu in 2021. During the Executive Council hearing following his nomination, Goldner attributed warming temperatures to “the earth’s natural cycle,” according to Bulletin reporting from the time.

The vote was the result of a procedural error — town officials had failed to correctly warn the initial bond votes.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in the Shelburne News on Sept. 11, 2025.
Shelburne voters on Tuesday re-certified a slate of bonds that had previously been approved by residents over the past four years.
The 15 different bonds total just over $5 million dollars and pay for some projects that have already been completed, such as the Irish Hill recreation path and the beach house replacement. There were no new bonds included in the vote, which passed 671-111.
The vote was the result of a procedural error — town officials had failed to correctly warn the initial bond votes.
According to state law, legal notices must be placed in the paper of record every week for three consecutive weeks leading up to a bond vote. In the case of these bonds, not all those notices were placed, which nullified the initial votes and prevented the town from accessing the bond funds.
The town caught the issue as part of a financial overhaul led by the new finance director Patricia Carpenter. Over the last year, her office has been working through a backlog of audits that hadn’t been completed since 2021.
In assessing the town’s finances, Carpenter’s office noticed that many of the bonds that had been taken out over the years had never been drawn down — towns will traditionally front cash or take out short term loans known as bond anticipation notes to pay for projects, taking on the debt with the state bond bank once the item has been purchased or the project completed.
This put Shelburne in a sticky situation. Because the bonds had never been drawn down and now couldn’t be due to the issue with the legal notices, it left the town with $1.2 million in cash on hand and an $800,000 bond anticipation notice for new water meters that would need re-approval to be rolled over on Sept. 20.
Had the vote been rejected, the town might have been forced to use private loan providers to finance its debt, which usually offer much higher interest rates than the state bond bank. Currently the interest rate at the bond bank is around 5% — higher than it might have been when the bonds were initially passed, but lower than what the town might find elsewhere.
In response to an email releasing the unofficial results of the vote on Tuesday night, town employee Susan Cannizzaro quickly wrote what most were probably thinking, “Phew! Great news!”
Although the town will now be able to draw down its bonds, there are still some issues that need attention.
Carpenter said the problems with warning for the bond votes is an example of why the town’s financial policies and procedures need updating — there was confusion over whose responsibility it was to post the legal notices.
“The people that were here were here for so long that they didn’t have policies and procedures. They just knew what to do. And so, when you get new people in here, we all don’t know,” Carpenter said in an interview about the financial audits.
Updating the policies and procedures, she added, and writing everything down, will ensure that, even if there’s turnover, everyone will know who is responsible for what.
“I am excited to get back to work now that we’ve put this issue behind us. Onward!” selectboard chair Mike Ashooh wrote in response to the bonds passing again.

Minnesota is one of 16 states that have a AAA bond rating, according to the governor’s office.
Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Group in their comments affirming Minnesota’s bond ratings said the state has a strong economy and a healthy reserve fund to pay off debt.
Minnesota’s general fund revenues in August were about 4% above the state’s February forecast, according to Minnesota Management and Budget, the state’s budget agency. In fiscal year 2025, year-to-date receipts are about 0.5% higher than the forecast.
In May, Moody’s downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing concern over the federal government’s ability to pay back debt.
The downgrade “reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,” Moody’s said in a statement.
Erin Campbell, MMB’s commissioner, said in a statement that Minnesota had to make difficult budgetary decisions during the legislative session earlier this year, but it has paid off through the state’s bond rating.
“We had to make hard budgetary choices this year and were able to reach consensus on those choices with the most closely divided Legislature in the country — which is a major accomplishment,” Campbell said.
The state government is confronting significant growth in health care spending due in part to the aging of Minnesota’s population and corresponding increase in people who need help, while economic growth has been hampered by a lack of workers.
MMB will make another detailed forecast in November or early December.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250425_1005-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-15 15:56:56.803438

WILMINGTON — The HBCU Week Foundation has announced that Juvenile and K. Michelle will headline the 2025 HBCU Concert Series during the 9th annual HBCU Week Wilmington.
The nonprofit organization, dedicated to increasing enrollment and supporting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), said this year’s concert will be one of the most unforgettable highlights of the week.
Michelle, a proud HBCU graduate, recently transitioned into country music with the release of her new single “Jack Daniel’s” and an upcoming country album. In addition, she joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, expanding her presence in both music and entertainment.

Juvenile, a New Orleans-based rapper, just released deluxe reissues of his classic 400 Degreez album, and a nationwide tour underway; he continues to influence generations of hip-hop fans.
Over the past eight years, HBCU Week has celebrated Black excellence while driving educational impact through boosting college admissions and awarding millions in scholarships. Past concerts have featured Wale (2021), Monica (2023), and Jadakiss, JT, Lady London, and Honey Bxby (2024).
“This experience is all about laying the foundation early for current and future students,” said Ashley Christopher, founder and CEO of HBCU Week Foundation.
“It’s about showing students what HBCU culture is all about. By immersing them in that experience, we help students envision their future in an HBCU long before the college fair or the scholarships come into play.”
Highlights of the week include a VIP reception, a college fair at Chase Fieldhouse, the concert at The Queen Wilmington headlined by Juvenile and K. Michelle, and a closing day party on September 27.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/hbcu-week-headliners.png,,,2025-09-15 15:56:56.803438

(File photo courtesy of Clemson University)Clemson University has fired an employee and removed two professors from teaching duties for what it called “inappropriate” social media posts related to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
The firing came two days after the university suspended the still-unnamed employee. An investigation for possible termination is underway for the two professors. They were initially told Friday to “stay out of the classroom,” a statement from the school read.
The public Upstate university declined to provide any further information on the “personnel matters.”
Clemson announced the firing and teaching suspensions an hour before the school’s governing board was scheduled to gather for an emergency meeting Monday.
The social media posts came to light last week when Clemson College Republicans began flagging the three employees’ online reactions to Kirk’s death — including posts from two assistant professors.
The actions followed outcry online from state politicians, Clemson students and alumni and Republican members of South Carolina’s congressional delegation.
The school posted a notice of the closed-door meeting following a letter from Legislature’s GOP leaders Saturday calling on the board to gather.
Clemson suspends employee following social media posts mocking death of Charlie Kirk

On Monday, Attorney General Alan Wilson, who is running for governor in 2026, told Clemson leadership they can fire the employees without risking prosecution.
A state law dating to 1950 makes it illegal to “discharge a citizen from employment or occupation” because of their “political opinions or the exercise of political rights and privileges guaranteed to every citizen.” Violators can be fined up to $1,000 and sentenced to up to two years in prison.
But that law “poses no obstacle from a criminal law standpoint to the termination of these individuals,” Wilson wrote in a publicly released letter addressed to Clemson President James Clements. The attorney general noted he’d carefully reviewed the law’s history and court precedent.
“I have determined that any corrective action by Clemson, terminating these professors, will not be prosecuted in the criminal courts of this State,” he wrote, adding that applies to every other college in South Carolina as well.
“I strongly support freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment, as defined by court decisions, as well as civil discourse conducted in a civil manner,” he wrote. “The statements of these professors were far from civil, however. Just the exact opposite.”
Wilson, in his letter, called the comments “vile and incendiary comments on a public platform.”
While Clemson officials don’t risk prosecution, the college could still be sued “if the professors believe their free speech rights were violated” by their firing, Wilson noted. However, he concluded by citing a 2006 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that all employees of the government “must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.”
No one requested Wilson’s opinion. He reviewed the law on his own, according to his office.
Two days earlier, when Clemson announced the first suspension, Wilson posted on social media “Nope. Not good enough.”
“Clemson, you know what to do — do it,” wrote the graduate of Francis Marion University and the University of South Carolina School of Law.
Other Republican gubernatorial candidates also weighed in. None of them graduated from Clemson.
U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, whose district covers South Carolina’s Charlotte suburbs, posted on social media that other universities have fired employees and expelled students.
“For the safety of the students, Clemson must take action or lose every cent of funding,” wrote Norman, a Presbyterian College graduate.
Clemson is far from the only public college investigating social media posts.
The University of Mississippi announced last week it had terminated an employee due to “hurtful, insensitive comments” made on social media regarding Kirk’s killing, according to reports by Mississippi Today, a States Newsroom affiliate.
Ball State University also is investigating similar postings from a pair of employees, according to the Star Press in Muncie, Indiana.
Middle Tennessee University fired a dean for online comments.
And the University of Tennessee announced Monday it was investigating posts from an assistant professor, NBC affiliate WSMV-TV reported.
SC colleges to talk about campus safety in wake of Charlie Kirk assassination

U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Citadel graduate who represents the state’s coastal 1st Congressional District, called on state legislative leaders to call a special session to “defund Clemson until they do what is right, ethically and morally.”
Furthermore, Mace wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, asking the agency to “cut off federal funding from any elementary, secondary, and post-secondary educational institution refusing to hold teachers or administrators accountable for celebrating the murder of Charlie Kirk.”
And Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette on Saturday urged students to drop out of any classes taught by professors who “spewed hateful speech and far-left rhetoric celebrating the death of Charlie Kirk.” For all students who drop a class for those reasons, their schools should refund them for the cost of the class, said Evette, a graduate of Cleveland State University in Ohio.
Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012 to combat progressive politics on college campuses, was shot in the neck about 12:20 p.m. Wednesday as he debated with students at Utah Valley University. About 3,000 people gathered outside for one of Kirk’s signature “prove me wrong” events.
A controversial figure whose organization fueled a conservative youth movement, Kirk was answering a question about mass shootings when he was hit by a single bullet. The 31-year-old father of two was pronounced dead at a local hospital. On Friday morning, officials announced the arrest of a 22-year-old Utah man, who was not a student of that college.

(Photo by 	GarysFRP/Getty Images)The federal permit that allows Northwest states and some Native nations to trap and kill salmon-eating sea lions in the Columbia River was reapproved late last week.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service renewed a 2020 permit that had allowed the removal of 540 California sea lions and 176 Steller sea lions from Bonneville Dam and Willamette Falls.
Of that approved number, only 116 Californias and 114 Stellers were taken. The new permit allows the remainder of the original permit to be removed — a total of 486 sea lions between now and Aug. 22, 2030.
The approach generated immense pushback in the late 2010s, with the 2020 permit application generating about 22,000 public comments — of which, fewer than 200 supported it, The Seattle Times reported then.
But controversy over the killings has faded in the years since. Officials have repeatedly failed to reach consensus on how to fight off salmon extinction in the river, leaving sea lions as an obvious target.
This time, NOAA said, the permit application received only one comment.
 Key salmon predators

“This extension allows us to continue important work to manage (sea lion) predation on salmon, steelhead and other native fish populations while supporting ongoing recovery efforts in the lower Columbia River,” Casey Clark, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s lead marine mammal researcher, said in an email.
The department targets the sea lions at Bonneville Dam in particular because fish returning to spawn are corralled into the dams’ three fish ladders’ roughly 12-foot-wide entries as they try to pass the dam. That turns the entrance into a buffet for the opportunistic predators.
“The dams have created an ‘evolutionary win’ for the sea lions: They can feast at the fish ladders with very little effort,” said Kerry Solan, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Portland District, which runs the dam. “As part of our (sea lion) hazing efforts, we use pyrotechnics and rubber bullets: basically, nonlethal deterrents to move the sea lions away from those areas.”
But the animals don’t waste time while they’re at the dam. They eat three to five salmon a day on average, said Doug Hatch, a senior scientist at the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fishing Commission, which represents three of the four treaty tribes in the program.
Hatch has led the organization’s sea lion program since 2005, and says 515 sea lions have been removed since 2008.
The vast majority of those removed sea lions were killed, largely because zoos don’t want them, he said. The animals are killed by a veterinarian who injects them with a sedative, then euthanasia drugs.
While removal numbers vary from year to year, federal data shows the total is trending upward.
And Hatch said modeling shows those 515 removals have helped keep struggling salmon stocks afloat, for now.
“Conservative estimates put that at over 100,000 fish that have been saved by these sea lion removals,” he said.
Those removals are crucial for stopping sea lions from “decimating” salmon stocks, Solan said. That’s because, despite the Corps’ best efforts to scare the animals away, they just keep coming back.
“Hazing temporarily changes foraging behavior in a small area for a brief period of time, because sea lions quickly learn that hazing doesn’t hurt,” she said in an email. “Overall, it is difficult for nonlethal measures to overcome the lure of a seafood buffet at the artificial constriction presented by the dam.”
 Growing populations

But populations of the protected animals continue to grow.
The first three Steller sea lions were documented at Bonneville Dam in 2003, according to NOAA Fisheries. Fifteen years later, “a minimum of 66 animals were observed at the dam during a single day.”
And in the past decade, the number of California sea lions in the Columbia River basin jumped from fewer than 500 to around 4,000.
Hatch said that while no one knows exactly what’s driving that, the best guess is that food sources in Southern California collapsed, and then decent Columbia River fish returns in the 2000s drew sea lions here.
But during that same roughly 20-year period, salmon and steelhead populations have stayed static at Bonneville.
In the river at large, between 10 million and 18 million fish returned each year before the hydropower system. Recently, they’ve numbered about 2.3 million.
Wild fish, in particular, have suffered. Most wild Columbia Basin salmon and steelhead runs are less than 5 percent of their pre-1850s levels, a 2022 NOAA report found.
Of course, the fish confront more challenges than just sea lions. Climate change, ocean overfishing, habitat destruction and dams (which obstruct fish passage and heat the river to deadly highs) all play huge roles in their struggles.
Compounding that, the Trump administration has gutted recovery funding, and the hydropower industry is lobbying for reduced accommodations for the fish.
 More removals ahead

Amid unending finger-pointing over what can be done to prevent salmon extinction in the basin, sea lions have emerged as a rare point of agreement, allowing the removal program to continue largely outside of the limelight.
The program is expanding beyond the easy pickings near Bonneville and Willamette Falls and will remove sea lions at more sites between the Interstate 205 Bridge and McNary Dam.
But Hatch acknowledged that likely won’t be enough to satisfy some who want sea lions removed from other locations. Earlier this year, for example, smelt dippers on the Cowlitz River fumed when the animals munched on smelt runs the state blocked them from harvesting.
“I’m sure, from many people’s perspective, we’re not doing nearly enough,” Hatch said.
But for Hatch, the goal is just to break the animals’ Bonneville Dam habits and keep them down by the mouth of the river where their diet is more varied than just salmon.
“They’re very clever, these animals are,” he said, “it’s hard to keep ahead of them.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)The federal Rural Health Transformation Fund (RHTF) application period opened Monday. Virginia and other states will now have until Nov. 5 to apply for their piece of the $10 billion dollar per year pie. 
With $50 billion earmarked over the next five years, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Mehmet Oz emphasized on a press call Monday morning how the fund can address root issues for rural health challenges. 
“We think we have an opportunity not just to plug a few of the holes, but to transform in a lasting way the rural health care system in this country.”
He listed investment in workforce, updates to information technology and infrastructure of hospitals as examples of what the funding could fuel. Governors are supposed to work with their states to draft the applications. Awards should be announced by the end of this year and funding disbursed in early 2026. 
It’s not clear when or if the commonwealth will apply for the funding. A spokesperson for Youngkin did not provide a statement by the time of this publication. 
Half of the funding will be evenly distributed to states with approved applications, Oz said. The other half will be awarded to states based on individual state metrics, a release about the applications opening further explained. 
For states that are deemed to have not performed using the funding, the federal government will “have the ability to claw back some of that money and reallocate it to the states that are performing.” 
“This is not punitive, it’s quality control,” Oz said. 
Former Health and Human Services secretary Xavier Becerra said on a separate press call Monday that the RHTF would not be enough to counter recent federal policy actions  by President Donald Trump’s administration and Republican majorities in Congress that advocates and Democratic lawmakers say stand to strain health care across the nation in the months and years ahead. 
“It’s a prescription for a man-made disaster,” Becerra said of recent changes to vaccine access by current HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the lack of renewal of premium tax credits that help people purchase health insurance, and the reconciliation bill passed this summer that will adjust hospital funding mechanisms and likely cause millions to lose Medicaid coverage.
Federal COVID vaccine access shifts reverberate statewide, Va. advocates, health care workers say

Virginia’s Health Benefit Exchange director Keven Patchett told lawmakers last month that about 100,000 people could fall off their insurance if the ACA tax credits aren’t renewed. Virginia’s Medicaid director Cheryl Roberts noted the state’s 600,000 people enrolled in its expanded Medicaid program are most likely to be affected by the eligibility and enrollment changes spelled out in the reconciliation bill. 
Hospitals have warned for months that they could be faced with cuts to services or closures down the line. Augusta Health also recently closed two primary care clinics and an urgent care clinic under its umbrella in Shenandoah Valley, citing the reconciliation bill as part of the reason. 
When asked on the press call how the transformation fund could help further alleviate issues triggered by the reconciliation bill, Oz said that “providing insurance is not providing health care.” 
Eventually health systems could see spikes in private health insurance as hospitals negotiate with private insurers to help offset costs of caring for uninsured patients, health care associations have said.
Former Health Resources and Services Administration head Carole Johnson said on the press call with Becerra that Congress shouldn’t have voted to alter Medicaid “thinking it’s not going to affect all of us.” 
She called the Rural Health Transformation Fund a “band-aid” for larger problems that was used as a “political solution” to get the reconciliation bill through, following pushback from some Republicans with large Medicaid or rural populations in their states. 
Often, rural hospitals depend on both Medicaid and Medicare populations to make their businesses run, Johnson said. 
 A look ahead

As Congress works to conclude its work for the end of this year, Democrats and some Republicans have their sights set on extending the ACA tax credits, to potentially spare at least the estimated 100,000 from losing coverage. 
Democrats have emphasized the lack of the tax credits renewal was one of several reasons they opposed the OBBA. Though ultimately voting for the reconciliation bill, U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, had expressed concerns about it and has since joined a bipartisan chorus to extend the ACA credits for the time being. 
Following this year’s gubernatorial election, either Democrat Abigail Spanberger or Republican Winsome Earle-Sears could oversee the next state budget that would address changes spurred by the federal health care actions.
Spanberger is examining how to streamline the eligibility process for Medicaid to ensure eligible people don’t fall off. Earle-Sears has expressed interest in tapping into Virginia’s “rainy day fund” to cover the gap, which lawmakers in appropriations committees stress is a short-term solution. Either woman would also be able to weigh in on future Rural Health Transformation Fund applications to direct that federal money to Virginia’s areas of need. 
For now, White House spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita emphasized in a statement that the program is “a win for every rural community across the country, and the administration urges every single governor to apply.”

Emily O’Brien.
Dustin McNally, assistant dean of student success for the College of Engineering and Mines at UND, was selected Saturday after multiple rounds of voting by Republican members of District 42. 
“I just want all the people in my district to know that I’m listening to them and trying my best to represent their views,” McNally told the North Dakota Monitor on Monday.
O’Brien resigned her seat in August after accepting a position to become the deputy commissioner for the Department of Health and Human Services. She had served in the Legislature since 2017.
McNally challenged Sen. Claire Cory, R-Grand Forks, during the 2024 Republican primary, but failed to secure the party’s nomination after receiving 44% of the vote in the two-way contest.
“I knocked on 1,000 doors, and talked to people and flyered, so people have heard from me and did vote for me,” he said. “I just didn’t get enough votes. So, I think it made sense for me to be the representative because the people know me.”
Grand Forks lawmaker resigns to join North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services

He said one of the issues he plans to focus on is continuing to reform the state’s property tax system, even after lawmakers expanded the state’s primary residence credit during the 2025 legislative session. 
Phyllis Lewis, vice chair for NDGOP District 42, said she didn’t have too many interactions with McNally before Saturday’s vote, but she hopes he’ll keep the district’s conservative values alive as he becomes a state lawmaker.
“We’ll definitely be looking forward to seeing if he does follow through and does what he’s saying,” Lewis said.
McNally, originally from Lisbon, N.D., holds two bachelor’s degrees from UND in mechanical engineering and international studies. He also received a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from UND in 2007, according to the UND website.
After graduation, he worked as an engineer for the Energy and Environmental Research Center at UND before becoming a full-time faculty member in 2013.
McNally said he plans to run for election to the seat during the 2026 election to seek to complete O’Brien’s term that expires in 2028.
When asked what he will bring to the table as a new lawmaker, McNally said one word: leadership. He added he wants to have meetings with Grand Forks residents and start a newsletter to keep people informed about major issues.
“We don’t just want another vote for someone that is just going to vote on bills, but we need a leader in our district, in the Legislature,” he said.

(Screenshot via Attorney General's X livestream)Attorney General James Uthmeier filed two new complaints Monday against pornography companies based in Cyprus, Florida, and California for failing to prevent children from accessing online adult content.
The complaints were both filed in the Twelfth Judicial Circuit in Sarasota County seeking $50,000 per violation from each of the pornographic companies. The firms have bucked a 2024 Florida law requiring porn networks to install an age verification tool blocking minors from surfing these sites, Uthmeier argues.
“Florida is committed to being the best place to raise children. We passed strong legislation to keep kids from being exposed to harmful and toxic material, and instead of following it, these platforms ignored it,” Uthmeier said in a news release. “We are taking them to court to make sure they cannot continue bypassing Florida’s common sense safeguards.”
This is Uthmeier’s second round of legal action against international pornographic websites lacking age verification tools. In August, he sued a host of Czech-owned porn companies for refusing to comply with Florida age laws. Some decried the “idiocracy” contributing to the “scam” of age verification.
The first complaint targets the Cyprus-based Gethins Limited and the Deerfield Beach-based companies Toccata, Segpay Gateway, and Segregated Payments. The for-profits all work on the website “lustyheroes.com,” which offers pornographic video game content without an age-blocker, the suit says.
The other complaint zeroes in on California’s Aylo Holdings USA and Aylo Billing US, as well as the Cyprus-based Aylo Group and Nutaku Entertainment. The complaint says these companies operate a variety of popular pornographic sites lacking user age-walls, including PornHub, RedTube, Tube8, and YouPorn.
All websites are fully out of compliance except for SpiceVids, which added a paywall in July 2025 and “immediately” allows users to access the site after pressing “enter.”
This comes a year after the GOP-led Florida legislature passed HB 3, which demanded social media sites require their users to be at least 14 and pornography sites ensure their users are over 18.

Hernandez did not speak at Monday’s news conference, which was hosted by the West Virginia Lottery with remarks from Morrisey. Morrisey said Hernandez is planning on using some of the winnings to go on vacation with her daughter.
West Virginia law allows lottery winners who win $1 million or more in a state drawing to remain anonymous. Morrisey said Hernandez is one of three out of the last 20 winners of $1 million or more in the state to choose to go public about their winnings.
Dave Bradley, the acting director for the state lottery, said the jackpot that Hernandez won part of totaled $1.8 billion — the second largest jackpot in history — over 42 consecutive weeks of drawings. Hernandez’s winning ticket, he said, was one of 18 total $1 million wins selected in the jackpot’s final drawing.
The 7-Eleven that sold the winning ticket to Hernandez will also receive a 1% selling bonus totaling $10,000. All retailers in West Virginia that sell a winning ticket for $500 or more receive a selling bonus.
Morrisey said he knew the Hedgesville community would be excited for Hernandez’s win. He said the money was “going to make a big difference” in Hernandez’s life and that of her family.
“I think that you’re going to become one of the most popular people in Hedgesville,” Morrisey said. “… I know a lot of the people in that community. This is going to be wonderful. People will be celebrating it.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s new state legislator, Catelin Drey, was sworn into office Monday, officially ending Republicans’ supermajority hold on the chamber.
Drey, a Sioux City Democrat, won the August special election to represent Iowa Senate District 1, which was called following the passing of Sen. Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton, in June. The 37-year-old marketing firm account executive and mother won with 55% against her Republican opponent Christopher Prosch at 44% in the election.
On Monday, Drey stood in the Iowa Senate chamber and took her oath of office from Iowa Supreme Court Justice Matthew McDermott. She was joined by her husband, children and Senate Democratic colleagues.

Speaking to reporters, Drey said she was “honored” to join the state Senate while acknowledging that political tensions are high in the aftermath of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and the shooting of two high school students by a classmate in Colorado.
“There was something very humbling about taking the official oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the state of Iowa at a moment when it feels like that has become increasingly difficult or increasingly controversial,” Drey said. “And so, that oath is sacred, and I look forward to doing the best that I can to uphold that.”
Drey said she believed it was important for leaders to work to prevent future instances of politically motivated violence.
“I think right now we have to turn the temperature down,” Drey said. “And talking to my neighbors, I think that we’re much closer politically than the climate right now gives us credit for. I’m thinking about the safety of kids in school, I’m thinking about the safety of myself and my Senate colleagues. But I am optimistic that we have an awareness now that this type of rhetoric is dangerous, and I’m also optimistic that we can find some solutions to solve the gun violence crisis that is ongoing in this country.”
In addition to speaking in support of efforts on firearm regulation, Drey said that she wants to focus on issues like public education funding, child support and water quality as a state legislator.
With Drey sworn in, there are now 17 Democrats in the Iowa Senate, breaking Republicans’ 34-member supermajority. While Republicans maintain a large majority in the chamber — in addition to retaining supermajority control of the Iowa House and holding all but one statewide elected office — Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner said the special election results will push Iowa Republicans to work more with members of the minority party in the 2026 legislative session than they had in previous years.
“Way too often the last few sessions it was perhaps a Senate of 34,” Weiner said. “Now we’re a Senate of 50. If they want to get people confirmed, if they want some other things, they will need to work with us. But that’s honestly the way it should work.”
In addition to Drey’s victory, Democrats have fared well in some other Iowa special elections in 2025, including the victory of Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, in a January special election. Democrats have said these recent victories show the party could be more competitive in Iowa’s 2026 midterm elections than in previous recent elections.

The Delaware Tourism Office (DTO) has opened applications for the second round of its Tournaments, Events, and Athletic Meets Sponsorship (TEAMS) Program, designed to grow the state’s sports tourism industry.
The TEAMS initiative provides financial support to attract new regional, national, and international sporting events while helping existing tournaments in Delaware expand their reach.
“The TEAMS program plays a vital role in positioning Delaware as a premier destination for sports tourism,” said Division of Small Business Deputy Director Jaimie Watts. 
The program is open to both new and existing events.
“By providing targeted financial support and resources, we empower event organizers to bring high-profile tournaments and competitions to our state—driving economic growth, increasing visitor stays, and showcasing Delaware on a regional and national stage,” said Watts.

 Officials say it is intended to support tournaments that increase overnight stays, boost the state economy, and generate regional or national media coverage.
“Sports Tourism is a major economic driver in our state,” said DTO’s Sports Sales Leader Ryan Wolfe. 
“Last year alone we saw over $75 million in estimated economic impact from our efforts. Programs like TEAMS help us attract bigger, bolder events that bring fans, athletes, and media from all over the country. By backing exciting new events and helping our established tournaments level up, we’re fueling big economic wins, and putting Delaware in the spotlight in the sports scene.”
Applications are available on a first-come, first-serve basis through the DTO website and will be reviewed until funding is depleted.
In its first year, TEAMS received 43 applications across 14 types of sports. Twenty-four organizations were awarded a total of $500,000, generating an estimated $75 million in economic impact, more than 20,000 hotel room nights, and participation from 180,000 people.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pexels-pavel-danilyuk-6539271-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-15 14:57:01.459426

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s top education official has threatened to ban from the classroom any teacher who “attempts to glorify” the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
But, revoking an educator’s license to teach is not a decision state Superintendent Ryan Walters can make alone. A majority of the Oklahoma State Board of Education would have to agree, and though Walters leads the board, his relationship with a majority of its members has been rocky.
Even when past board members voted in lockstep with Walters, his prior attempts to revoke teaching licenses over political statements have been difficult and protracted legal affairs that sometimes spilled over into court, with educators’ First Amendment rights and their strict professional conduct standards hanging in the balance.
“Let me be clear: any teacher or employee who attempts to glorify this disgusting act of violence will have their teaching license taken from them and will never step foot in an Oklahoma school again,” Walters wrote in an announcement posted to social media on Thursday.
Kirk, a founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was shot to death Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and their two young children.

Walters on Saturday identified an Inola Public Schools teacher whom he said his administration is investigating for calling Kirk a “racist, misogynist piece of s—” on video. A Sand Springs Public Schools teacher also is under investigation for a Facebook post about Kirk, Walters wrote on social media.
The Sand Springs middle school teacher had written, “Charlie Kirk died the same way he lived: bringing out the worst in people,” according to screenshots posted on social media by Rep. Gabe Woolley, R-Broken Arrow, who alerted Walters to the teacher’s post.
“This disgraceful rhetoric has no place in schools,” Walters wrote of the teacher’s words. “Charlie Kirk was an amazing man who inspired millions of young adults. This will not be tolerated in Oklahoma classrooms. We are investigating this teacher’s actions.”
The Oklahoma State Department of Education has received numerous reports of teachers’ comments, and each will be investigated on a case-by-case basis, agency spokesperson Madison Cercy said.
“Superintendent Walters has made it clear: there is no place in Oklahoma classrooms for disgusting attacks promoting and justifying political assassinations that disrespects a man who dedicated his life to America, truth, and his Christian faith,” Cercy said after Oklahoma Voice asked how the agency would define glorification of Kirk’s killing.

Employees of public and private entities across the country, including public school teachers, are facing punishment in the workplace for posting negative comments about Kirk on social media, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an organization advocating for free speech. The foundation condemned both the shooting of Kirk and “the cancel culture machine” that has ensued since his death as attacks on free and open discourse.
In Oklahoma, revoking a teaching certificate most commonly occurs when an educator is convicted of a crime, but during Walters’ tenure as state superintendent, teachers’ political speech has come under fire, as well.
Last year, the state Board of Education revoked the certification of former Norman High School teacher Summer Boismier after a yearslong process that involved overruling the recommendations of a judge, who had reviewed the case and found Walters’ staff failed to prove the teacher deserved such a penalty. 
As part of a classroom display opposing book bans, Boismier had posted a QR code that linked to the Brooklyn Public Library’s free online catalog. The state Education Department contended that some of the books, among thousands in the catalog, contained content inappropriate for minors. 
Her appeal to overturn the revocation is still pending in Oklahoma County District Court.
After the 2024 assassination attempt of President Donald Trump, Walters tried to revoke two teachers’ certifications over their social media posts. Both cases still are stuck in procedural limbo, and neither educator has had their certification suspended or revoked so far.
One of the teachers, of Ardmore City Schools, made a Facebook comment stating she wished Trump’s shooter “had a better scope.”
The other, of Edmond Public Schools, is facing decertification over a picture he posted five years before the assassination attempt. The 2019 image shows a child wearing a Trump mask, a boy pointing a toy knife at the mask and the teacher grimacing.  
In August 2024, the state Board of Education referred both cases to a hearing before an administrative law judge, who would review evidence and testimony before recommending whether the board should take further action.

The teacher from Edmond has not yet had his hearing, according to the Oklahoma City law firm he hired to represent him in the proceedings, White & Weddle P.C. 
Records in Oklahoma County District Court show his attorneys have sought a court order to obtain the Education Department’s full investigative file of his revocation case.
The Education Department did not return a request for comment on whether the Ardmore teacher has had her hearing yet.
State law requires strict professional standards for educators that allow teachers to be fired and their certifications to be revoked for certain offenses. That includes punishment for “moral turpitude,” which is defined in part as immoral behavior or failing to faithfully perform a teacher’s duties.
Public schools have “broad authority” to limit educators’ speech both while on the job and outside of work, according to the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teacher union.
Even when an educator is speaking as a private citizen outside of work, a government employer might sometimes limit a teacher’s speech if it is disrespectful or too disruptive, particularly if it sparks protests, complaints from students and families, or criticism from the broader community, according to NEA guidance.
But teachers are still protected under the First Amendment to express their opinions outside the classroom as private citizens, “regardless of whether Superintendent Walters agrees with them,” said Megan Lambert, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma.
“While some narrow categories of speech are not protected by the First Amendment, the Superintendent’s vague description of ‘attempts to glorify’ Charlie Kirk’s death is not among those exceptions,” Lambert said. “In fact, political speech lies at the heart of the First Amendment’s protection, and the state is constitutionally prohibited from punishing teachers because it disagrees with the viewpoint they express.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey Republican’s proposal to add additional penalties for politically motivated violent crimes won bipartisan support on Monday.
Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson) will join Sen. Doug Steinhardt (R-Warren) as a prime sponsor of yet-to-be-introduced legislation that would create heightened penalties and mandatory minimum sentences for certain violent crimes that were motivated by political animus.
Steinhardt’s push to boost penalties for political violence follows the assassination of Republican organizer and influencer Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot during an event at a Utah university last week.
“Working together is the only way forward, and it sends a crucial message that this isn’t a partisan issue. Political violence hurts everyone and it’s happening too often to too many people. We must act now to deter it and hold violent offenders accountable,” Steinhardt said in a statement.
Kirk’s killing was the latest in a spate of politically motivated slayings.
In June, a gunman posing as a police officer killed Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband and critically wounded Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife. The shootings prompted New Jersey lawmakers to seek greater protections for their personal information.
“Politically motivated violence is an attack on the foundation of our democracy. No one in this country should live in fear for speaking their mind, and elected officials must be able to govern free from threats, harassment, or attempts to silence them for their beliefs,” Stack said in a statement.
The bill has yet to be formally introduced. Lawmakers can introduce bills when the Legislature is called for a quorum, though the Legislature is expected to stay in recess until after this year’s Assembly and gubernatorial elections.
The scope and severity of the additional penalties contemplated by the bill are unclear. Under existing law, bias intimidation offenses — what New Jersey calls hate crimes — raise the degree of a given offense by one.
For example, an individual charged with second-degree aggravated assault could face five to 10 years in prison, while an individual charged with the same crime with a bias intimidation upgrade could face 10 to 20 years.

Social media comments concerning Kirk’s death have proliferated in Virginia, including remarks by school system workers in Accomack, Chesterfield, and Orange counties and the city of Newport News that have stoked controversy.

On Sunday, Axios Richmond reported that Chesterfield County School Board member Dorothy Heffron announced she would resign at the end of her term on December 31, following her widely criticized social media post that drew condemnation from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is also running for governor, and other leaders. 
“Call me old fashioned, but I remember when we used to be okay with shooting Nazis,” Heffron wrote on Instagram. Her account has since been deleted.
“Parents entrust our educators with the care and development of their children, and they rightly expect teachers and school leaders to model the values of respect, civility, and responsibility,” said Gullickson in a statement. “Anyone who would suggest the heinous murder of the father of two young children is acceptable should be disqualified from teaching or working with children again.”
Heffron’s remarks struck a nerve among Republicans including Youngkin and. Earle-Sears, who claimed on Sept. 14 that Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger had not responded to the tragedy or social media remarks.
Spanberger shared a statement with Richmond TV news station WWBT on Sept. 12 condemning political violence.
“As the investigation continues and law enforcement continues to build their case, I think it’s important to state unequivocally: I condemn any efforts to justify or minimize the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk or anyone else,” Spanberger wrote.
The Virginia Education Association (VEA), the largest union for teachers and support specialists, questioned the superintendent’s response when, according to VEA President Carol Bauer, their members face harassment through various forms. 
“This is a little bit of political overreach. I certainly agree that educators should model professionalism. We really cannot support a blanket condemnation that fails to distinguish between private personal expression and professional conduct,” Bauer said to 13News Now.
However, Bauer said the association “stands ready” to support its members “whose due process rights have been violated in this climate.”
In Virginia, multiple cases have arisen regarding remarks about the death of the 31-year-old, who was a husband and father of two young children.
One case involving an unnamed staff member at Newport News Public Schools was suspended after reportedly stating, “I hope he suffered through all of it,” in reference to Kirk.
A staff member of Accomack County Public Schools is also under investigation for a comment posted on social media, according to Superintendent Gennifer Miller. Republicans including Earle-Sears have also highlighted another Central Virginia teacher’s comments about Kirk. 
Del. Mike Cherry, R-Colonial Heights, a member of the state House Education Committee, stated that the public deserves both answers and actions.
“Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, we’ve seen some very concerning language (I’m trying to be polite) from Chesterfield teachers and a member of the school board. “The behavior is not the way we should expect those entrusted with our children to act. The public deserves both answers and actions, and they deserve them fast,” Cherry said in a statement Monday.
Prior to his death, Kirk had been known for galvanizing young Republicans and bringing unity to the party, and his efforts through his Turning Point USA organization were widely credited with cementing President Donald Trump’s reelection. 
Kirk was also often a polarizing figure, known for inflammatory remarks on race, gender and religion — including declaring the Civil Rights Act a “huge mistake” in 2023, calling prominent Black women political figures “affirmative action picks” who “do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously,” and saying “it’s worth it” to have “some gun deaths every single year” to protect Second Amendment gun rights.
Florida teachers have also been warned they will be investigated for derogatory social media posts regarding Kirk.

“We are eager to act on this funding plan in the coming days and swiftly send it to the Governor for her signature,” House and Senate Ways and Means Chairs Aaron Michlewitz and Michael Rodrigues said.
The House plans a formal session Wednesday and the Senate has scheduled a formal session for Thursday.
The joint statement from Michlewitz and Rodrigues, released just after noon Monday, said the funds will help hospitals and community health centers “as they confront rising health care costs in the face of persistent economic headwinds and an unfriendly federal government.”
The House and Senate earlier this year debated funding supplements for health care facilities and the chairs said the $234 million will be included “in a partial supplemental budget to be reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee.”
The Legislature has spent much of 2025 working on spending bills and in July dropped from their last supplemental budget $134 million for the Medical Assistance Trust Fund that both branches originally approved and $209 million for fiscally strained hospitals and community health centers that the Senate pushed.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality State Energy Office is launching a $10 million Home Repair Weatherization Readiness Program, a companion to the current Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).
This funding applies to counties damaged by Hurricane Helene and identified as “Most Impacted and Distressed” by the State of North Carolina Action Plan, the agency announced last week.
The office plans to award $6 million to the Western Piedmont Council of Governments and $4 million to a list of current WAP service providers.
DEQ hopes to serve more than 575 households with the program, according to a press release.
The funds can contribute to home repair for affected homes on the WAP deferral lists, where households were placed if a home needed major repairs or other work that was not eligible for existing funding.
“This new weatherization readiness funding is an important piece of the comprehensive effort to accelerate long-term recovery and strengthen energy resilience in communities hit hard by Helene,” DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said. “These projects will drive down home utility bills and ensure safer, healthier and more energy-efficient homes for families who need it most.”
By making affected homes more energy efficient, DEQ is also helping to lower carbon emissions and reducing the strain on the electric grid,
As the state works to provide additional relief to those impacted families, Gov. Josh Stein made a request Monday to ask Congress for $13.5 billion towards Hurricane Helene recovery.
This allotment would contribute to restoring homes and small businesses, supporting local government services, and rebuilding roads and bridges.
Stein will travel to Washington on Wednesday to meet with federal officials about the plea.
“Nearly a year has passed since Hurricane Helene struck western North Carolina, and it’s been nearly nine months since Congress last appropriated money toward recovery. Just like folks in the gulf states, the mid-Atlantic, and Puerto Rico, the people of western North Carolina deserve federal support after a major hurricane, and the time to act is now,” Stein said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/disasternctwo2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 14:57:01.459426

The Committee for Safe and Secure Elections, created in 2022, is offering a number of new resources for both election officials and law enforcement officers, including pocket-sized legal guides detailing election laws in all 50 states, giving both groups an easily accessible reference should questions – or issues – arise on Election Day.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 22 states have enacted or updated laws to protect election officials and poll workers since 2020. In August, the committee released an updated version of these guides to reflect changes to election laws in states across the country.
In observance of the International Day of Democracy, Sept. 15, the Michigan Advance spoke with Tina Barton, the committee’s co-chair and the former Rochester Hills city clerk, about the threats election workers face, and the committee’s work to prepare and protect them. 
Election law is not something that’s taught at an academy when law enforcement officers begin their careers, Barton said, and laws can differ at sites like schools or libraries when they’re being used as an election site.
“We work with Secretaries of State, with [attorneys general], with election officials’ associations in all the different states to say, ‘Hey, what are the most common offenses, or what would law enforcement most likely be confronted with during an election cycle that you would want them to have that law right there in their hands,’” Barton told the Advance.

Barton pointed to laws regarding carrying guns at polling places as one example.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation in 2024 barring individuals from possessing a firearm in a polling place on Election Day, or while in-person early voting is being held, as well as banning weapons within 100 feet of the entrance to an early voting location or polling place. The new laws also bar individuals from carrying a gun within 100 feet of an absentee voter dropbox, local clerk’s office or satellite office in the 40 days leading up to an election.
Law enforcement also may not be aware of specific details on how many feet campaigners are required to stand away from the entrance to a polling place, Barton said. The guides produced by the coalition act as a roadmap detailing for exactly what an officer’s authority and powers are, and what the restrictions are for violations of the law. 
“When they’re road law enforcement and they’re out writing tickets for speeding, for a light that’s out or running a stop sign, whatever that might be, those are common occurrences for them,” Barton said. “Election cycles, people breaking election laws, committing fraud, that sort of thing, that is not [a] commonality for them. So, this puts that in their hands.”
The guides can also serve as a resource for election officials who are struggling to start a conversation about collaboration with law enforcement, Barton said.
“They can provide that to them… and that often is a really good launching point to start the conversations about, ‘Hey, yeah, things have changed around elections,’” Barton said. “We are seeing some threats and harassment, and we probably do need to know more about this, and we probably should be collaborating,”
The committee recommends that clerks provide printed copies of their election law guides in the supply kits they send out to their precincts, and to introduce them in training sessions with election workers, especially the individuals in charge of overseeing a voting site. 
“It empowers and really kind of arms, if you will, election officials, poll workers, precinct workers, law enforcement,” Barton said.“It puts it, again, quick reference, right in their hands. They don’t have to go searching for it, especially if they’re dealing with somebody who’s belligerent.”










It gives law enforcement a clear path, and it also gives election officials some security of an added layer of protection, recognizing them as a protected profession.


They can also serve as an introduction and a guide for other resources the committee makes available, like its security assessment checklist, and its bomb threat resource guide, Barton said. 
Michigan instituted its own protections for election workers in 2023, setting criminal penalties for intimidating election officials or preventing them from performing their duties during an election.
Barton said these laws provide an added layer of assurance for election officials and offer a clear line for law enforcement to proceed with an investigation and prosecution if there is an official that’s being threatened, harassed or abused.
“I think that it’s good on both sides.” Barton said. “It gives law enforcement a clear path, and it also gives election officials some security of an added layer of protection, recognizing them as a protected profession.”
The Brennan Center for Justice, one of the committee’s supporting organizations, in July published a survey showing an increased number of election officials have begun coordinating with law enforcement. 
In 2024, 62% of the election officials surveyed reported working with local law enforcement, while 83% of the 858 officials surveyed in 2025 reported some form of collaboration.
Barton called those efforts a step in the right direction, noting the benefits that can come from the two groups sharing information and working to understand each other’s work environment.
“My husband’s [in] law enforcement. I’m an election official,” Barton said. “If we were to walk into a big room – consider it maybe as a polling location – our lens on how we view that room and what’s important to us is going to be very different.”
Although Barton said her focus would be on the number of outlets to plug in equipment, the flow of foot traffic and where to place booths, her husband’s focus would be more on safety and the ingress and egress of individuals within the polling place.

When looking at the driving force behind threats to election workers, Barton said it was often a loss of trust in public institutions, which can breed anger against individuals in government at any level for any reason. 
In Michigan particularly, where elections are decentralized, election workers are often the face of government in their communities, she added.
It’s also no secret that the country is very politically polarized, Barton said that’s not something election officials often talk about. Instead, they often keep their focus on the election process, the voters and the accuracy and security of the election.
“I will say, as a career election official, I have been friends with election officials all across the country for many years and the vast majority of them, I have no idea what their politics [are],” Barton said.
The close election results in 2020 also sparked a spread of mis- and disinformation, with the modern technological landscape making it easier for people to be siloed into circles and online algorithms without hearing outside perspectives or opinions.
“We’ve lost the ability to have civil conversations,” Barton said. “And I think that in and of itself is a challenge too. I’ve seen it break down friendships, I’ve seen it break down families, and a lot of it is driven by this mis-disinformation.”
At present, one of the committee’s most requested classes focuses on deescalation techniques, Barton said, telling the Advance that even outside of election season, clerks often find themselves in need of those skills. That’s especially true for those in Michigan who carry other responsibilities outside of administering elections.
Additionally, one in three election workers have experienced threats, harassment or abuse because of their job, Barton said. Data from the Brennan Center survey shows that of those reports, 63% said they’d received threats in person and 59% have received threats over the phone.
The attacks have also gone beyond the professional realm into election worker’s personal lives, with Barton telling the Advance she’d had some officials tell her their children have been harassed at school because of their jobs.
Barton said her career is now focused on teaching election officials how to avoid and respond to threats, like having SWAT teams called to their residence and having their personal information leaked online.
“We want to protect our staff, we want to protect ourselves, we want to protect our voters and we want to protect our families,” she said. “And so it’s an added layer of stress and concern and anxiety that I can tell you 10 years ago I did not feel.”

Colorado Politics first reported Pugliese’s resignation late on Sunday night.
Pugliese was first elected in 2022 to represent House District 14 in El Paso County. She was reelected in 2024. In January 2024, she was picked by fellow Republicans to lead the minority caucus after former Rep. Mike Lynch stepped down from leadership in the wake of a drunken driving scandal.
Her resignation comes about one month after a public confrontation on the House floor on the last day of a special legislative session. Democrats accused her of failing to disclose that former Rep. Ryan Armagost, a Berthoud Republican, took a photo of Democratic Rep. Yara Zokaie and sent it in a Republican House caucus group chat. Republicans responded with crude comments about Zokaie’s appearance and outfit and the photo then landed on social media. It went viral and Zokaie faced threats and harassment, including towards her children.
Pugliese insists that she told House Democratic leadership on April 14 that Armagost took the photo, and those leaders then failed to tell Zokaie. Democrats say they had to review House security camera footage to determine that Armagost took the photo.
It came to a head during a debate over a resolution to condemn Armagost’s behavior, and Pugliese confronted House Majority Leader Monica Duran.
“I am not a liar. I do not appreciate even (implying) that I am a liar, especially in a situation like this,” she said on the House floor.
Duran then responded to Pugliese and said it was an inappropriate time for the topic.
“The point of this day, in this moment, is to acknowledge what one of your members did to a member of mine,” Duran said. “If you want to talk about your character, or lack of character, let’s have that conversation. But I will not have that conversation here in this well.”
Pugliese immediately left the chamber, but returned to vote in favor of the resolution. In her resignation letter, she cited that incident and referenced the “collapse of integrity in the Colorado State House of Representatives.”
“The lies and hypocrisies the Majority spewed were beyond what I had ever expected, even in Colorado politics. It has been degraded, and the one word that is at the top of my mind is toxic,” she wrote.
House Republicans will now need to pick a new leader. A vacancy committee will also need to convene in Pugliese’s district to pick her replacement.
Duran and House Speaker Julie McCluskie thanked Pugliese for her time in the Legislature but did not address the incident during special session.
“Stepping up to lead a caucus and represent communities in our state legislature are commendable acts of public service, and we thank Minority Leader Pugliese for her commitment to the people of her district and service in the legislature. We admire her dedication to her children, and we wish her all the best in her move to Mesa County and in the next chapter of her life,” they said in a joint statement.
The former Senate minority leader, Paul Lundeen, also resigned this summer to head the American Excellence Foundation. Senate Republicans chose Sen. Cleave Simpson to replace him as minority leader.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) The search for a leader of a new independent oversight office for children in New Mexico’s custody officially opened Friday, amid turnover in leadership at the state’s troubled child welfare agency.
Lawmakers passed House Bill 5 earlier this year to establish the independent Office of the Child Advocate, along with a selection committee to establish a pool of candidates for the governor’s final appointment for a six-year term. The new office, which is attached administratively to the state Department of Justice, marks the latest attempt to address ongoing problems in the state’s child welfare system.
The law requires the child advocate to be an attorney, licensed social worker or psychologist with at least five years of experience in child welfare or juvenile justice.
Applicants for New Mexico’s Office of the Child Advocate have until the end of October to submit a resume.

The position opens as the state Children, Youth and Families Department also undergoes a transition at the top.
CYFD Secretary Teresa Casados announced her immediate retirement on Sept. 5, with her departure following criticism about the state’s reform progress, as well as high-profile suicides of children in care in recent months that sparked investigations by state authorities.
In a discussion with reporters last week, CYFD officials said they intend to prioritize systematic improvements in the division and make progress in the landmark 2020 Kevin S. settlement brought on behalf of the state’s foster children.
“My vision is to accelerate the movement of CYFD, to move our performance measures in the right direction, to get a stable workforce, well trained, educated, and ready to reduce caseloads,” Acting CYFD Secretary Valerie Sandoval told reporters on Sept. 11.
Sandoval also introduced the current CYFD leadership team, which includes Kathy Kunkel, a previous health secretary for the state who had been consulting for the CYFD since January 2024; and Brenda Donald, the former child welfare secretary for Maryland.
State lawmakers have continued to scrutinize lack of progress in the Kevin S. settlement terms, which include releasing more data; providing adequate mental health care; and eliminating group settings for children in state custody.
After lackluster progress and missed deadlines by state agencies, the parties went into arbitration earlier this year.
Kayla Jankowski, the lead attorney for all plaintiffs’ attorneys in the Kevin S. case, told Source NM the turnover in CYFD leadership, while not ideal, may be the catalyst for better outcomes and policy change.
“This is an opportunity for the current secretary and a future leadership to make sure that Kevin S. is their number one priority,” Jankowski said. “It’s also an opportunity for the governor to become more involved and assist by contributing her leadership to implementing Kevin S.”
Native American Disability Law Center Executive Director Therese Yanan, who also represents one of the children in the initial lawsuit, agreed that the settlement terms provide the strongest framework for addressing the state’s child welfare problems.
“It hits everything that needs to be addressed as far as providing community-based placements for children, providing community-based services and keeping children safe,” Yanan said. “The reality is kids need to be with families — not in offices, not in congregate care, not in shelters, not in residential treatment.”
Charles Peifer, an Albuquerque attorney appointed as arbiter in the Kevin S. case, has ordered the state to make “continual and continuous process,” through December and invited Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to personally attend upcoming hearings in October and November.
In a statement to Source NM, Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, said Lujan Grisham would not be able to attend upcoming hearings on Oct. 7 or Nov. 20 due to “scheduling conflicts,” but would continue to meet with the independent monitors.
“The governor will continue to do everything in her power to ensure the safety of our children, as demonstrated by our recent changes to how the CARA program is administered,” McGinnis Porter said. “Governor Lujan Grisham is wholly committed to improving the well-being of every child in New Mexico, as evidenced by her commitment to free early childcare, school meals, and other initiatives.”
Sandoval, who has worked at CYFD since 2016, most recently as a deputy secretary for CYFD’s protective services and juvenile justice department, says she understands the public and lawmakers’ frustration.
“These cases are tragic for us too, they hit me hard every single time,” she said.
As for addressing longstanding issues, she said the department is going to be guided by the experts.
“We’re going to make a better child welfare system, using the tools we have,” she said.

(Maps data: Google, Airbus, CNES/Airbus, Landsat/Copernicus, Maxar Technologies)The second largest mining deal in world history, announced last week, could hand one of Alaska’s largest mines — and a linchpin of the economy of Northwest Alaska — to a new operator.
Canada-based Teck Resources, which has long operated Northwest Alaska’s massive Red Dog zinc mine, and United Kingdom-based Anglo American said on Sep. 8 that they intend to merge into a $53 billion giant.
The new company, to be called Anglo Teck, would take control of Red Dog, a major driver of the regional economy and an important source of revenue for the Northwest Arctic Borough and Alaska Native corporations across the state.
It would mark a return to the state for Anglo American, which once owned half of the controversial Pebble Project — and spent more than a half-billion dollars on it over six years before pulling out in 2013.
The merger with Teck is still pending regulatory approval and could take more than a year to close.
Anglo Teck would be focused on copper, a key metal supporting the global transition to renewable energy, and it would operate dozens of mining projects around the world.
But in a call with analysts just after the deal was announced, Anglo American’s chief executive, Duncan Wanblad, singled out Red Dog, noting its potential “to continue its track record of strong cash flow generation.” The mine, operated on land owned by Northwest Alaska’s regional Native corporation, NANA, churns out more than 550,000 tons of zinc, lead and other minerals each year.
The mine generates some $600 million in annual gross profits for Teck — a share of which is distributed to NANA and then, as required by federal law, shared with other Native corporations across the state.
Industry observers say that the deal, if it goes through, is unlikely to significantly change the way Red Dog operates.
They also expect the new company to continue looking for new sources of ore to keep the mine running. Teck says Red Dog’s main deposit will be depleted in 2031, though it has been studying other prospects nearby.
“The impacts of the merger on Red Dog operations and exploration activities, I think, will be very minor for the foreseeable future,”  said David Hammond, a Denver-based mineral economist who has advised NANA on Red Dog-related matters in the past.
Hammond said he “fully anticipates the merged company will continue to fund exploration activities for the next generation of zinc production” in the region.
Industry leaders expect demand for zinc to grow in the coming years, and Red Dog is one of the world’s largest producers.
The effort to keep the mine running past 2031 has major implications for the Northwest Arctic Borough; Red Dog accounts for some 80% to 90% of the borough’s revenue. Borough officials, already anticipating revenue declines, have been considering cuts to government services.
Reached by phone Friday, the borough’s mayor, Dickie Moto, declined to comment, saying he first wanted to hear more from Teck about the proposed merger.
The company last year received a key permit for its work to find new sources of zinc ore for Red Dog. That work entails building 12 miles of roads and an underground portal that would help the company study two untapped mineral deposits on state land.
State regulators recently released Teck’s revised exploration plans, including a tentative construction schedule that suggests underground drilling at the new site will start in 2028.
“We remain focused on advancing the Red Dog Mine Life Extension to support the long-term economic and social benefits for Northwest Alaska,” Dale Steeves, a Teck spokesperson, said in an emailed statement.
NANA, the Native corporation that owns the Red Dog deposit, did not respond to a request for comment.

The directive reversed years of public and private sector efforts, including an executive order issued by former President Joe Biden in 2021, designed to bolster opportunities for populations that have long been underrepresented, particularly in STEM fields.
President Trump’s order has had a broad impact on institutions around the country, with agencies including NASA and the National Institutes of Health altering websites and eliminating requirements for inclusivity. To align with the new edict, researchers in Maine are changing the way they talk about their work.
Scientists told The Monitor they have rewritten grant proposals to remove language that, in many cases, before January would have been required to secure funding but now is considered a disqualifier. They deleted, for example, verbiage around diversity, supporting underrepresented individuals and similar “broader impact” considerations.
“The minute the election happened, we started trying to change how we spoke about our work,” said Deborah Bronk, president and CEO of Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay.
“You can justify our work many different ways, whether it’s climate change or fisheries or the economy or coastal resilience. We are not talking about climate change a lot these days with most audiences because that’s verboten right now.”

Other researchers reported similar changes.
“We have been making more of an effort to look at the types of language that we include in our grants,” said Jessica Chertow, vice president of research at MaineHealth Institute for Research in Scarborough, the research arm of Maine’s largest health care provider. The research institute relies on federal funding for nearly half of its $52 million budget, according to Chertow.
“We are trying to adhere to the rules and guidance of the new administration but also maintain our beliefs and our values,” said Chertow.
Most of the MHIR’s federal funding comes from the NIH, which recently terminated two grants the institute had been awarded, including one that provided support for early-career investigators. A key word search led NIH officials to mistakenly conclude the funding was being used to support work on vaccine hesitancy, even though the topic had not been studied in years, according to Chertow. The cancelled grant meant the loss of $1.46 million over two years.
Susan Collins’ tightrope walk continues in the fight over medical research

At MDI Biological Laboratory in Bar Harbor, President Hermann Haller said he and his colleagues are ensuring grant proposals are submitted with language that reflects the priorities of the current administration.
“It’s really about ideology, and that’s fine,” said Haller. “We have also re-written proposals that had been funded to fit the current goals of this administration.”
Several organizations said they have also changed the balance between fundamental research — sometimes referred to as high-risk, high-reward research — and more applied, translational work that can more quickly be transformed into practical health interventions or commercial applications.
“We did a strong pivot towards more applied, more commercially relevant research,” said Bronk, noting that the organization was in the middle of a strategic planning exercise when President Trump was elected last November. “We definitely are taking a different tack.”
Bigelow Lab, like other groups heavily reliant on federal funding, is also looking to other sources of revenue, such as increasing use of its fee-for-service analytical facilities and leasing out laboratory space to entrepreneurs working in related fields, said Bronk.
Both Haller, of MDI Bio Lab, and Chertow, of MHRI, said they are similarly shifting what they emphasize.
“Rather than pivot, it’s more about diversification,” said Chertow. “We’re very strong on the basic science side. We have an enormous opportunity to grow the clinical and translational research we do…to build up the clinical research arm of the Institute by leveraging our strengths — access to clinical data and access to patient populations.”
Like her colleagues, Chertow is also focused on new revenue sources, including philanthropy and more robust industry partnerships.
“I’m encouraging the researchers and the [principal investigators] within the Institute to really start thinking in a broader sense about their research funding portfolios.”
For the past 25 years, NIH support has allowed MDI Bio Lab to host promising undergraduates for summer research fellowships. The Lab depends on federal grants and contracts to cover about 44 percent of its $18 million operating budget. When the NIH funds for summer fellowships were unexpectedly blocked earlier this year, Haller and his team scrambled to launch an emergency fundraising campaign to avoid having to cancel the program.
Thanks to philanthropic contributions, MDI Bio Lab ultimately was able to preserve the program, with 23 students spending the summer gaining bench experience at its Bar Harbor campus.
“Independent research organizations like ours depend on federal funding,” Haller said. “Today, there’s enormous uncertainty: What will be funded in the future?”
 Funding cuts, executive orders sow uncertainty
The close knit community of independent scientific research centers in Maine typically lacks the tuition revenues and large endowments universities count on to help buffer the blow of federal funding cuts. In the past decade, federal agencies have funded more than a billion dollars in biomedical research in the state, according to a Monitor analysis of federal data.
That has made it particularly challenging for Maine organizations to navigate the abrupt, often unexplained cuts and delays in federal funding and executive orders that have upended the way science has been supported in this country for decades.
The turmoil has been “gut-wrenching,” said Bronk, of Bigelow Laboratory.
According to Bronk, about half of Bigelow’s $20 million annual budget is supported by federal funding, including from the National Science Foundation, NASA and NOAA, among others. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled a multi-year grant to Bigelow without explanation, only to reinstate the funding weeks later, said Bronk.
“The big impact to us is just the uncertainty.”
Long a champion of federal support for science, Sen. Susan Collins (R) has tried to use her clout as chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations to serve as a bulwark against the worst cuts. But the ability of the state’s senior senator to insulate Maine scientists from the whiplash of federal funding is limited.
“There is no investment that pays greater dividends to American families than our investment in biomedical research,” Collins said in a statement to The Maine Monitor. “The deep funding cuts proposed by the Administration would undo years of Congressional investment. We also risk falling behind China and other countries that are increasing their investment in biomedical research and recruiting U.S. scientists and researchers.”
The Trump administration has proposed reducing federal support for scientific research by more than 30% in the fiscal year that begins October 1. Some NIH institutes would vanish under a proposed reorganization that would consolidate the agency’s 27 institutes and centers into just eight. When the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, funds in the budgets of NIH and other research agencies that remain uncommitted will expire.
Under Collins’ leadership, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted in July to reverse the cuts. Still, the full Senate must vote to restore funding, after which they will have to reconcile differences with the House.
Scientists are also anticipating changes in the process for awarding federal research grants. An executive order issued in early August will have political appointees review and approve funding opportunities and awards for “consistency with agency priorities and the national interest.”
This is a major shift in the decades-old grant-making process, in which career civil servants have overseen such decisions.
“Science should not be political,” said Bronk. “I’m speaking out more and more, not to be disrespectful of the current administration. They were elected. They have a right to put their fingerprint on our federal government. What I try to focus on is: these are the consequences of federal actions.”
 Researchers prepare for loss of foreign talent
Scientific organizations around the state have also been bracing for a loss of foreign talent. A combination of State Department staffing cuts, travel bans, and the perception that America has become hostile to foreign-born workers resulted in a drop in international students at campuses around the country this fall, particularly in graduate programs and especially in the STEM fields, according to reporting by NPR.
So far, the drop has yet to materialize in Maine, which has fewer international students than the rest of the country. Scientific research organizations said they have seen some defections but are wary of more.
Without explanation, EPA restores some grants for PFAS research in Maine

Haller, of MDI Bio Lab, said at least one foreign postdoctoral scientist decided not to join his lab because of the environment, and Bronk said her institute lost a promising postdoc who was already on staff because the person didn’t “feel welcome in this country anymore.”
European institutions are actively recruiting the best U.S.-based scientists, said Haller. In the past, foreign organizations trying to lure investigators from American labs found it difficult to attract the best researchers. Now, said Haller, they have more applicants than they can accommodate.
“We have an excellent reputation in the field, and we have a really lovely culture, so we are a highly desirable destination if you are a marine scientist,” said Bronk, of Bigelow Lab. “But we can’t counter the fear of being detained at an airport and being shipped off somewhere without due process, so it’s just going to get harder.”
Losing foreign-born and trained scientists, she added, risks losing the diversity of perspectives that makes American scientific institutions so impactful.
“Part of the magic of cutting-edge research is lots of different ways of thinking coming around the table. If we fill all the spots with Americans, we will have lost this critical part of our secret sauce.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Lawmakers heard testimony from parents, first responders and faith leaders Monday as they considered a myriad  of proposals to address gun violence in the aftermath of a shooting at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis that left two children dead and more than 20 others injured. 
Gov. Tim Walz said he will call a special session on gun violence this fall, and the Senate Gun Violence Prevention Working Group is evaluating which proposals could be viable in a divided Legislature. 
An assault weapons ban — and any other law regulating firearms — is unlikely to pass, given Republicans’ temporary one-seat majority in the House, and dissent within the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party over gun control bills. The House is expected to return to a tie after a Sept. 16 special election in Brooklyn Park to fill the seat left vacant by the murder of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman. 
The working group heard testimony from five parents of Annunciation students who were hurt in the shooting, and from doctors who treated the injured students, all in support of a bill that would ban civilian ownership of “semiautomatic military-style assault weapons” and high-capacity magazines — those that hold more than ten rounds. 
“It is up to our lawmakers to decide which weapon our next mass shooter is armed with,” said Malia Kimbrell, the parent of a third-grade student at Annunciation who was injured in the shooting.
Dr. Tim Kummer, medical director of community outreach for Hennepin EMS, responded to Annunciation in the minutes after the shooting. A 12-year-old girl had what appeared to be a small graze wound on her head — but below the surface, the bullet’s velocity created a shockwave, causing the child’s brain to bleed. Doctors had to remove a section of her skull. 
“From a handgun, that wound would likely have only been a graze wound, but from a high powered rifle, it became a life threatening brain injury,” Kummer said. “Assault rifles turn survivable injuries into fatal ones.”
The working group also heard proposals that would do the following:


Establish an Office of Gun Violence Prevention within the Minnesota Department of Health.
Require gun buyers to complete a firearm safety course before purchasing a gun.
Create a public awareness campaign for Minnesota’s new “red flag” law, which allows judges to order the confiscation of weapons from a person deemed a danger to their own safety or others’. 
Create a Civil Commitment Coordinating Division within the Office of the Attorney General, tasked with streamlining the civil commitment process and collecting data on outcomes for those who are civilly committed. 
Re-establish a ban on binary triggers, which increase the rate of fire of a gun. (A judge struck down Minnesota’s binary trigger ban in August, ruling that the megabill that contained the ban was too broad in scope.)
Require serial numbers on all firearms, including those that are 3-D printed or assembled at home. 
Allow local governments to ban firearms from city-owned or leased buildings. 
Require all gun owners to store their weapons unloaded and equipped with a locking device; or loaded or unloaded in a locked firearm storage unit or gun room.

Sen. John Hoffman, DFL-Champlin, did not attend the meeting but submitted a bill to increase penalties on people convicted of impersonating a law enforcement officer. A man impersonating a police officer shot Hoffman and his wife Yvette before murdering Hortman and her husband Mark in the early morning hours of June 14. 
Sen. Glenn Gruenhagen, R-Glencoe, submitted to the working group an article he co-authored in 2019 with a natural medicine doctor who spread false information about COVID-19 before dying of the virus in 2021. The article attributes the rise in mass shootings to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs,  a common type of antidepressant. That claim has been repeated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, but psychiatrists and other experts have debunked a causal link between SSRIs and violence.

A week later, Florida formally applied for federal funds.
The state’s request for reimbursement for its spending on the migrant detention facility in the heart of the Everglades came just days after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit hit pause on a federal judge’s order shutting down the center over environmental concerns. The 2-1 vote claimed that federal environmental laws don’t apply because Florida officials haven’t used any federal money.
But less than eight days after the ruling — which stayed all aspects of the case — the Florida Division of Emergency Management asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be reimbursed, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told the Florida Phoenix in an email.
“The State of Florida submitted an application for reimbursement to [FEMA],” the spokesperson said. Although they didn’t comment on what day the application was made nor for how much money, this confirmed Politico’s reporting that FDEM’s executive director, Kevin Guthrie, said the state had applied for federal money.
Gov. Ron DeSantis has long promised that Florida would be reimbursed for its detention center spending, although neither his office nor FDEM ever clarified when they planned to ask for the money. Federal authorities similarly lauded the facility as a joint effort, but showed no signs of chipping in until last week.
“Under President Trump’s leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens,” the DHS official said. “These new facilities are in large part to be funded by FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program.”
The Shelter and Services program allocated $608.4 million toward FEMA’s new Detention Support Grant Program, specifically designed to expedite Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s mass detention and deportation agenda. If FEMA approves Florida’s request, the money will be awarded by Sep. 30. The Everglades facility is estimated to cost around $450 million for the year.
The attorney general’s office redirected questions to FDEM, which did not respond to questions about the application’s timeline.
 ‘So what do you say, judges?’
In a 2-1 decision on Sep. 4, the Eleventh Circuit both paused federal trial judge Kathleen Williams’ order to shut down the facility and fully stayed the case. The lawsuit was brought against the state by the Miccosukee Tribe and environmental groups Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biodiversity.
They claimed the center, located within the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve, was harming the environment and violating the National Environmental Policy Act.
But judges Barbara Lagoa and Elizabeth Branch, both Trump appointees, ruled that Williams had erred by applying the federal law to a center that had exclusively received state funds. Florida hadn’t even applied for federal reimbursement, they argued. The activists have since asked the appeals court to reconsider their decision to halt the lawsuit.
If the judges don’t, Miami attorney Joseph DeMaria, said, the plaintiffs would be stymied unless they can “un-stay” the case — even though the majority opinion was largely predicated on the lack of federal ties.
“Unless they can get the case unstuck, there’s nothing they can do,” said DeMaria, who once worked as a prosecutor with the Justice Department’s Miami Organized Crime Strike Force. [The state] played it cute by saying, ‘We haven’t formally agreed yet, so federal law doesn’t apply.'”
He posed a rhetorical question the appellate judges on the case: “You said that the feds haven’t agreed to pay, so there’s no jurisdiction to enforce the federal environmental law, but then almost immediately after you said that, they went and agreed to pay. So what do you say, judges?”
Attorneys for the Friends of the Everglades declined to comment, while the governor’s office, the Miccosukee Tribe, and the Center for Biodiversity did not respond to requests for comment.

The Delaware Office of the Marijuana Commissioner (OMC) has announced the implementation of the Social Equity Financial Assistance (SEFA) Grant Program, an initiative aimed at advancing equitable participation in the state’s adult-use marijuana industry.
The program is designed to reduce barriers that have historically limited opportunities for individuals and communities disproportionately affected by previous marijuana laws. Through milestone-based grant funding, eligible licensees will receive support for key business needs such as facility build-out, equipment acquisition, and other start-up expenses.
RELATED STORY: Strong start to rec. marijuana sales, nearly hitting $1M in first weekend
“By launching the SEFA Grant Program, Delaware is taking a significant step toward ensuring that the state’s adult-use marijuana industry develops in a manner that is inclusive, diverse, and sustainable,” said Commissioner Joshua Sanderlin. 
“This program is an essential component of our broader effort to build a regulated market that both protects public health and promotes equitable economic opportunity.”
Program details

Eligibility is limited to approved social equity marijuana licensees in Delaware.

Funding amounts vary depending on license type.

Grants will be disbursed in phases as operational milestones are met.

Funds are restricted to approved business expenses and will be subject to oversight.


The first distribution of SEFA funding is expected to begin in the coming weeks as licensees reach their required operational milestones.

David Morales speaks at an Aug. 6, 2025, ""Save RIPTA"" rally in Kennedy Plaza in Providence. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)On the day before his 27th birthday, Providence Democratic Rep. David Morales announced Monday morning he will challenge Mayor Brett Smiley to lead the capital city in the September 2026 primary.
Morales pledged to tackle rising rents, expand affordable housing, and invest in Rhode Island’s struggling public transit system when he made the news official in a campaign launch video posted on social media at 8 a.m.
“This is our home, and it’s time City Hall worked for us,” Morales said. “Politicians like Brett Smiley have asked us to trust their experience while working families are struggling to get by.”
Born in Soledad, California, Morales was raised by his single mother who worked in the fields to help support his sister and her special needs nephew. He graduated from Soledad High School in 2016 and went on to earn his bachelor’s in urban studies from the University of California Irvine in 2018. 
Morales came to Rhode Island to pursue a Master’s in Public Affairs at Brown University, which he completed in 2019.
Since 2021, Morales has represented Providence’s House District 7 — which covers Providence’s Mount Pleasant, Valley, and Elmhurst neighborhoods. At the time he was elected, Morales was the youngest Latino state legislator in the nation.
Now in his third term on Smith Hill, Morales is still the state’s youngest legislator.
In the General Assembly, Morales has emerged as one of its most progressive and outspoken members, particularly in protecting Rhode Island’s renters. 
“We don’t ask for much, we just want a life we can afford in the city we love,” Morales said in the launch video.
Rental costs are certainly high in Rhode Island’s capital city. A report published in July by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that renters in the Providence metro area would need to make $31.04 an hour to afford the average rent of $1,614 for a two-bedroom unit.
In his first interview after his announcement on Spanish-language Poder 102.1 radio Monday morning, Morales said he would propose a 4% cap on rent increases. Smiley has resisted rent caps, instead prioritizing the construction of more housing units.
Smiley, 46, was first elected mayor in 2022 after winning a three-way primary with 42% of the vote. He faced no Republican or independent opposition in the general election.
Smiley served as the director of administration and chief-of-staff for former Gov. Gina Raimondo. He previously ran for mayor in 2014, before pulling out of the race to join Jorge Elorza’s administration as the chief operating officer at City Hall.
Josh Block, a spokesperson for Smiley’s campaign, didn’t directly address Morales’ challenge when reached for comment Monday morning.
“The election is still a year away, and Mayor Smiley is focused on governing here in Providence and protecting residents from the harmful policies of the Trump administration,” Block said in an emailed statement. “There are serious challenges ahead, and we need someone with Mayor Smiley’s decades of experience in finance, management, and government to continue navigating Providence through this critical time in our city’s and our country’s history.”
The progressive challenger does face a significant uphill battle heading into 2026, as Smiley boasts a little over $1 million in his campaign account as of the state’s most recent reporting deadline in June. Morales’ account had about $68,000 on hand.
Smiley also holds the advantage of incumbency in a city that has not ousted a sitting mayor since Republican Buddy Cianci beat Democrat Joe Doorley in 1974. Smiley also lives on the East Side, known for its high primary voter turnout and affluent campaign donors.
“The East Side has an outsized role to play in the primary,” Wendy J. Schiller, a Brown University political science professor, said. 
But Schiller said Morales has the potential to rally a base of voters seeking a change, citing the example of New York State Assemblymember and Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary this summer.
But the odds don’t appear to faze Morales, who moonlights as a professional wrestler with the Renegade Wrestling Alliance.
“There are a lot of people in our community that are frustrated and upset with the current administration,” he told Rhode Island Current in a phone interview Monday. “There is a desire within our city for a change.”
Morales said he’s not leaving his life as a professional heel, but said he’s holding his last match “for a while” on Saturday.
The Democratic primary is scheduled for Sept. 8, 2026. Approximately 57% of Providence’s 100,316 registered voters on the state’s active roster are Democrats.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)An Idaho judge dismissed a whistleblower lawsuit against the Idaho Attorney General’s Office by a fired attorney, preventing the case from a jury trial. 
Idaho 4th District Judge Jonathan Medema on Friday granted summary judgement in favor of the Attorney General’s Office in the lawsuit brought by former deputy attorney general Daphne Huang, who had represented the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. 
Huang’s lawsuit focused on several alleged conflicts between Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador with the state health agency, including his investigation into millions of dollars of child care grants the agency distributed.
“The Court finds that viewing the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, no rational juror could find Plaintiff had proven any of her claims,” the judge ruled.
Idaho Attorney General’s Office asks judge to dismiss fired attorney’s whistleblower lawsuit

The ruling, in response to the Attorney General’s Office’s request to dismiss the lawsuit on a motion for summary judgement, came before the case was set for a two-week jury trial in October. 
Her lawsuit was filed in September 2023 under the state’s whistleblower law, called Idaho’s Protection of Public Employees Act. The Attorney General’s Office has argued Huang was fired for misconduct — not whistleblowing.
In a statement Monday, Labrador said he will “continue protecting Idaho families and ensuring government accountability.”
“Idahoans elected me to protect families, uphold the Constitution, and ensure government follows the law,” the attorney general said. “The people of Idaho sent a message that they wanted to change the direction of the Attorney General’s office. When I took office, we began advising state agencies on legal compliance and setting our policies in place. While this former employee may have disagreed with our policy directions, the court found no basis for her claims.”
Guy Hallam, an attorney for Huang, said she was “surprised and disappointed that the court would not allow a jury to decide whether Mr. Labrador violated the law.”
“We believe that the ethical rules which govern the actions of attorneys in the state also apply to Mr. Labrador and the Office of the Attorney General,” Hallam said in a statement Friday. “It seems that the Idaho Supreme Court is going to have to decide whether that is true.”

 Labrador’s subpoenas to Health and Welfare ‘were legally unenforceable,’ but not a conflict of interest, judge rules

In March 2023, months after Labrador became Idaho’s attorney general, Huang was fired hours after expressing concerns about the ethics of the Idaho Attorney General’s Office’s new management.
Much of her lawsuit’s claims revolved around Labrador’s investigation into $72 million of child care grants distributed by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.
As an attorney representing the agency, Huang provided legal guidance twice to Health and Welfare saying the agency’s grant distribution was legally sound. Labrador’s office later revoked the advice. 
The judge found that civil subpoenas Labrador served on employees of the Department of Health and Welfare “were legally unenforceable.”

But Medema departed from a separate Idaho judge’s past ruling that the subpoenas amounted to a conflict of interest between the Idaho Attorney General’s Office and its own client, the Department of Health and Welfare. 
The civil subpoenas, formally called civil investigative demands, were “the State of Idaho trying to subpoena itself,” Medema wrote. “… Thus, the Court fails to understand how Ms. Huang reached the opinion that the service of the (subpoenas) created some conflict of interest.”
“It is entirely irrational to conclude that the Attorney General of the State of Idaho, when he is investigating compliance with state law by state employees, now has an interest that conflicts with the interests of other officials of the State of Idaho … in their official capacities,” Medema wrote. “To accept that premise, one must logically conclude that those executive branch officials, acting in their official capacities, have a legally protected and enforceable interest in violating state law.”
But the attorney general doesn’t need to use the power of the courts “to stop some other executive agency from acting contrary to the law,” the judge wrote.
“The Attorney General does not need to resort to a power granted him by the Legislature and enforceable in the judicial branch to get information from the Department of Health and Welfare, the way he must in order to get information from private charitable organizations,” Medema wrote. “He does not need to resort to the power of the courts to stop some other executive agency from acting contrary to state law. He does not need to do so because both the Attorney General and the Director of the Department of Health and Welfare serve at the pleasure of the Governor.”
In Idaho, the state’s attorneys general and governors are elected in separate races. Before becoming Idaho’s attorney general, Labrador in 2018 lost a gubernatorial primary election challenge against Idaho Gov. Brad Little.
 Former Health and Welfare director approved sharing phone with data with AG’s Office, judge wrote

Part of the case centered around Huang allegedly giving the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare the cell phone of her former supervisor, who was asked to resign days before Huang was fired. 
The phone had data that Health and Welfare allegedly claimed privilege over and was deleted from the phone before it was returned to the Attorney General’s Office, court documents show. That was despite a request from the Attorney General’s Office to return the phone with the data preserved, the records show.
Health and Welfare’s then director, Dave Jeppesen, had told Huang he was “‘fine’ having the phone physically returned” to the Attorney General’s Office’s then-Chief Deputy, David Dewhirst, “with the data intact,” the judge wrote. But days before Huang planned to give the phone to the office’s Dewhirst, Huang gave the phone to a Health and Welfare staffer after they asked for it, the judge wrote. 
“Assuming she was fired for her decision to hand the phone to (the Health and Welfare staffer), and assuming, without deciding, that handing the phone to (the staffer) was the only way in which she could have complied” with ethical rules for attorneys, “her claim still fails as a matter of law,” Medema wrote. “Director Jeppesen had previously given express consent to revealing the data on the phone to Chief Deputy Dewhirst.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-15 17:26:57+00:00,CT Mirror,A new CT law seeks to get all schools on the same page about handling library book challenges,Michayla Savitt | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/15/ct-library-book-challenges-law/,Every school district must establish policies to ensure libraries have a process for handling challenges to books and other materials.,"The school year is back in full swing for students and educators, and under a new law, every district is required to establish policies to ensure school libraries have a process in place for handling challenges to books and other library materials. Those challenges have skyrocketed since the pandemic.
In 2024, 38% of the nationwide book challenges were in school libraries, and 5% were in schools themselves, according to the American Library Association’s (ALA) Office for Intellectual Freedom.
Under the new Connecticut law, a school board has to adopt three policies: a collection, development and maintenance policy, a library display and program policy and a library material review policy.
The law, which also contains provisions for public libraries’ collection and review policies, passed after lawmakers folded the language into this year’s state budget. The language was similar to the Senate Bill considered by the Children’s Committee.
‘Think of all of the children in the community’
Ellen Paul, the executive director of Connecticut Library Consortium (CLC) estimated that about half of the state’s school districts have some degree of library policies, though some haven’t been updated since the ’90s.
“I have a feeling that there’s going to be a lot of schools, and a lot of boards of education, that need to start doing work on this,” Paul said.
CLC and the Connecticut Association of School Librarians have been holding online information sessions since August for school library staff to learn the new law.
The policies must abide by certain parameters, such as following the state’s non-discrimination statutes. But the rules must be approved by the board of education in consultation with the superintendent, the director of curriculum and a librarian from the district.
“We are not prescribing a standard policy, because we know that what works in Norwich, might not work in Norwalk,” Paul said.
The law also states that a “school library media specialist is professionally trained to curate and develop a collection that provides students with access to the widest array of age-appropriate and grade-level-appropriate library and other educational material.”
The policies are to allow thoughtfulness to the reconsideration request, so materials are “not just being pulled off the shelf because one person doesn’t want their child to read the book, that we think of all of the children in the community,” Paul said.
The law also states that school material reconsideration requests are only limited to “the parents and guardians of students and eligible students currently enrolled in the school or school district.”
Nationwide, only 16% of book challenges last year came from parents, the ALA report found. Much of the rest came from special interest groups, government officials and a board or administration.
Some opponents to the Connecticut bill said in public testimony they feared it would have a chilling factor on the ability to challenge books. The bill’s supporters emphasized creating a fair process to review material was vital to preserving the freedom to read.
“School libraries have always been spaces where students can explore the world and begin to understand themselves,” Val DiLorenzo, president of Connecticut Association of School Librarians, said in a joint statement with other library organizations after the bill’s passage.
“That doesn’t mean every book is right for every reader, but it does mean students deserve the chance to choose with guidance, not censorship.”
‘Decisions aren’t being made in a back room’
Connecticut’s not the only New England state that’s codified “freedom to read” policies into its laws. Rhode Island passed a similar effort this year, and Vermont’s law, which passed last year, took effect this July.
ALA’s Office for Intellectual Freedom said in Connecticut there were 29 title challenges in 2022, and 117 in 2023. Last year there were only 17, a downward trend that mirrored the national data. But the group said it is likely an undercount, and Paul echoed that sentiment.
“When you’re relying on people to just self-report that, you’re not going to get the full scope of the issue,” Paul said.
The ALA said that legislative restrictions in states, such as schools being required to limit or remove library materials with themes about race or racism, LGBTQ+ issues or more broadly containing “sexual content” has also likely led to the drop in documented challenges.
This year, New Hampshire’s legislature passed a school book bill largely along party lines that would have prohibited materials showing nudity or sexual content if it “lacks serious literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value for minors.” The measure would have also created a process for challenging library materials. The governor vetoed it.
Connecticut has not passed such laws regarding the content of library materials. But some state legislators unsuccessfully attempted this past legislative session to broadly ban sexual content in books. This included a bill that did not make it out of the education committee, and an amendment to a measure surrounding electronic book contracts for libraries.
Paul said she hopes that the new law can give reassurance to people that book challenges are handled with care, “being reviewed by people who live and work in the community, people who send their children to these schools, and that decisions aren’t being made in a back room by one or two individuals.”

In the restaurant, the server was pleased, thanking them for coming. Because these days, tariffs and White House rhetoric have left Canadians a rare breed of visitors in New England, usually a hotspot vacation destination from the nearby province of Quebec.
“There’s a lot of people staying in Canada because of that,” said Dave Gingras, a 35-year-old biker from Saguenay, about two hours north of Quebec City.
While other Canadians are avoiding buying American products or traveling to the States, the group of 11 decided to leave politics behind on their road trip through New England.
“We are just keeping it neutral and trying to enjoy,” Gingras told Stateline.
After breakfast, they donned helmets and mounted an assortment of dusty Yamaha, BMW and Triumph bikes.
“We drive and when we’re tired, we stop and raise up a tent and relax with a beer,” Gingras said before pulling into a line of crawling traffic on the White Mountain Highway, the scenic byway dotted with quaint inns, old-timey stores and Colonial and Victorian homes.
Across Northeastern states, business owners and state officials have labored to maintain key economic connections with Canada despite the rhetoric coming out of the White House. President Donald Trump’s trade war, aggressive immigration enforcement and talk of making their country the 51st state has offended many Canadians. While concerns are acute in New England, tourism hubs from Hawaii to New York are reeling from a decrease in Canadian visitors.
To quell tensions, Maine leaders erected signs in French to welcome Canadian visitors and New Hampshire’s governor just returned from a Canadian trip she took to strengthen trade and tourism.
But hospitality businesses this summer reported a sharp decline in visitors from the North — Canadian travel to New Hampshire is down about 30% this year, according to state officials. Border crossings into Vermont hit their lowest levels since 2021, according to federal data, as the Canadian government reported a 34% drop in the number of August car visits into the U.S. compared with the same month last year.
New England businesses remain concerned as the region turns the page on the summer vacation season to its vibrant autumn, known for luring leaf-peeping travelers from across the globe.

Tourism is vital for White Mountain Valley communities like North Conway. While it’s home to only about 2,300 people, the village is a historic travel hotspot known for outdoor activities, tax-free shopping and family-friendly theme parks.
While many people think of the area as a winter ski destination, summers are actually the largest travel draw, said Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mt. Washington Valley Chamber of Commerce.
The drop in Canadian tourism has been especially evident during less popular travel times for Americans. For example, Canada’s Victoria Day, a late May holiday celebrating that queen’s birthday, has traditionally brought big crowds to the Northeast.
“Our retail outlets are a very, very popular destination for them during that time,” Proulx said. “And our retail outlets have reported that it was basically nonexistent this year.”
Proulx said local businesses have tried to lure travelers from close-by regions like the Boston area to help make up for the loss of Canadian tourists, “so it’s not an unrecoverable loss.” But the absence of visitors from parts North is hard to ignore.
“It almost feels like a birder might feel if they find a rare species,” he said. “If you see someone with a Canadian license plate, you notice it right away. It gives you a little bit of a smile.”
Aside from the economic loss, Proulx said he worries about longstanding relationships.
This scenic valley is nostalgic for many visitors from the U.S. and Canada alike. He said many people return again and again, sharing fond memories of their first camping trip along the Saco River, childhood trips to the Santa’s Village amusement park and picturesque rides on the Conway Scenic Railroad.
“So we just don’t want anybody thinking that they’re not welcomed here. That’s our biggest thing,” he said. “We want everybody to be able to call this their second home, to be able to visit and reconnect and feel welcomed.”
‘Towns are quieter’
In the heart of North Conway, tourists picnic on the grass in Schouler Park, look into the 1874-era train station and meander into shops selling hokey souvenirs and homemade fudge. Framing the village is the imposing Mount Washington, which at 6,288 feet boasts the tallest peak in the Northeast.
At one of the town’s busiest intersections, the crowds come in waves to the North Conway 5&10 Store. But even as families line up, employee Polly Howe said she hadn’t seen many Canadians this summer.
“It’s a shame,” she said, bouncing between the cash register, the candy counter and stocking staples like toys and hats.
In a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the souvenir shop has been around for 86 years and features a false-front facade, the kind made famous in boomtowns of the Old West. Manager Terri Johnson said she had encountered a good number of Canadians inside the shop, but said she didn’t blame any who felt put off by the political climate.
“I’m thankful they still come after all that,” she said.
It’s not just international relations that have changed tourism here.
A rainy start to the summer season didn’t help, and business owners say anxiety over the domestic economy and inflation have pinched travel budgets.

Mark Lahood says family travel has dipped at the three hotels he operates in the area.
“Towns are quieter,” he said this summer. “They’re not quiet, but they’re much quieter than years’ past.”
Some summer weekends, which traditionally sell out entirely, the three hotels had 30% vacancies, he said. And travelers are more keen for weekend trips than their weeklong road trips of previous seasons.
“With a seven-day trip, by the time they were all in, it’s a lot of driving, it’s a lot of gas money, it’s a lot of meals, it’s a lot of hotels,” he said. “And I think it’s just too much.”
To help with rising costs, he ran a free breakfast promotion for kids earlier in the summer. And he increased an existing international discount for Canadian guests.
“Did it help anything? Probably not. But you know, when you view it from a Canadian traveler, at least you made an effort.”
The decline in Canadian visitors has allowed for more local, spontaneous travel, said Genn Anzaldi, who owns J-Town Deli & Country Store in Jackson, New Hampshire.
“More day trippers for sure,” she said. “So maybe not as many people spending the night or as many nights.”
The scent of sizzling bacon and toasting panini fills her shop, which offers hot meals along with handmade gifts and convenience store staples.
Anzaldi, who also runs a cooperative marketing effort for a group of independent restaurants, said the local restaurant business was down, but not significantly.
The reason?
“Canadians,” she said. “I wouldn’t say it’s the economy. That seems to be going well.”
About nine miles away from North Conway, things are a bit quieter in Jackson, home to a famed one-lane covered bridge. With its spas and boutique hotels, Anzaldi said the community is more known as a destination for weddings, romantic stays and outdoor getaways.
While Anzaldi said she hopes Canadian tensions settle soon, she noted that the matter lies in the political domain and there’s little business owners can do but carry on.
“We have to run, right?” she said. “We’re not personally going to go up and advertise.”
States try to ease federal tension
To maintain tourism and trade, Democratic and Republican politicians in the Northeast have made overtures to their counterparts in Canada.
Since Trump’s inauguration, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has met with Maine businesses near the border, embarked on a diplomatic Canadian tour and even installed “Bienvenue Canadiens” welcome signs near border crossings. But on her trip this summer, she was reminded that it’s not just tariffs that have irked Canadians — many are also worried about the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement.
“Lots of people don’t feel safe in the U.S. right now and for good reason,” Susan Holt, the premier of the New Brunswick province, told Mills, according to local news accounts. Holt has encouraged her constituents to avoid traveling to the United States.
Last year, the state said some 800,000 Canadians visited Maine. On her June trip, Mills asked Canadians to remember those who rely on the tourism industry.
“To the extent people feel angst about coming to Maine, just remember that if they aren’t coming to Maine, the ones that they’re hurting are the small mom and pop businesses,” the governor told News Center Maine while in Halifax.
Mills’ office did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Similarly, New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte said ahead of a trade mission that she aimed to welcome Canadians to the Granite State, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported.
“That’s one of the things I’m going to just continue to promote on behalf of New Hampshire,” Ayotte said last month. “Not only that they’re welcome here — the Canadians — but we have open arms to them.”
Ayotte’s office did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment about her trip.
René Sylvestre, the Quebec province’s delegate to New England, said those gestures are appreciated. He spends much of his time meeting with state and business leaders. Last month, he met numerous state lawmakers at the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston, where he is posted.
But he said calming federal tensions will be key to seeing a rebound in tourism.
“What we can see right now is people in Quebec are really sad with the whole situation,” he told Stateline. “But they’re saying, ‘Maybe we should stay and spend more time in Canada these days.’ So this is really the impact that we’ve seen, and we think that it’s going to take a while before it’s back to normal.”
A decline in international travel has hit border communities across the country — from New York state to Washington state. North Dakota estimated that Canadian visitors spent about $14.4 million less in the first half of the year compared with last year, as the number of personal vehicles crossing the border from Canada declined by 30%. Other hubs for international visitors, including Las Vegas and Hawaii, are also seeing significant declines.
“Right now, it’s hard to turn back federal policy,” Hawaii state Sen. Ron Kouchi told Stateline in August.
Kouchi, a Democrat and president of the state Senate, said Canada has traditionally been among Hawaii’s top five travel markets. The state has sent tourism officials to trade shows and is trying to show Canadians, like all visitors, the Aloha State’s iconic hospitality. But he said that message hasn’t been persuasive, even coming from leaders of the solidly liberal state.
“While we argue about Republicans or Democrats, in other nations they simply look at Americans and they don’t see it as an R or a D thing,” he said. “It’s an American thing.”
A stormy beach season
Old Orchard Beach in Maine is a favorite of New Englanders and Canadians alike.
Part of the Portland metropolitan area, the vacation town sports a seaside amusement park and seven miles of sandy beaches. But some Canadians started to cancel their summer reservations to the area early on in Trump’s term.
Sean Nickless, who co-owns the 30-room Crest Motel with his family, said Canadians began calling off trips in January and February,
Those cancellations and poor weather foretold a slower summer. “It’s not as steady,” Nickless said, noting business had been inconsistent with shorter stays.

Like many of the other beachfront properties here, the retro Crest Motel relies heavily on repeat customers, filled out by the occasional road tripper who ducks in from the angled carport to ask about an available room.
“The best you can do is let Canadians know they’re still welcome here,” he said from the motel’s small lobby scented with the aroma of a drip coffeemaker and a bright popcorn machine.
At the height of summer, rain ushered in what should have been a booming weekend along the Atlantic’s Saco Bay. Crest Motel guests swam, but only under the cover of the pool’s rolling roof.
Down the way, five teenagers stood listlessly inside a walkup Dairy Queen with no customers to serve. On the pier, arcade games, $1-per-visit restrooms and barstools sat idle. Few took up heavily advertised offers for pizza by the slice, $15 lobster rolls or fried clam cakes.
“I’ve never driven around Old Orchard Beach in the summer and seen ‘vacancy signs.’ I  have this year,” said state Sen. Donna Bailey, who represents the community. “I mean, you just never see that in the middle of July — all you see is ‘no vacancy’ signs.” A Democrat, Bailey emphasized that Canada isn’t some far-off destination for Mainers. People routinely cross the border for health care and work. They have friends and family on both sides.
“I mean, there’s some places up in northern Maine that the nearest hospital is in Canada, as opposed to in the United States. You know, some people have their babies over in Canada.”
But aside from emphasizing existing bonds, Bailey said Maine residents and officials were largely at the mercy of the federal government’s actions.
“I think it’s helpful to remind the Canadians of our personal relationship and that we are Maine and we’re Mainers, and so we’re not necessarily the same as the federal government,” she said. “But, yeah, it does only go so far.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein is asking Congress and the Trump administration to send an additional $13.5 billion to North Carolina, his latest ask for federal aid as recovery from Hurricane Helene continues one year later.
Included in that request is $8 billion in additional grants to rebuild homes and businesses, $2 billion in community loans from FEMA, $2 billion to repair roads and bridges and $400 million for forgivable loans to small businesses.
“The next stage in recovery is going to require a new commitment from Congress and from the administration,” Stein said during a news conference outlining the request in Flat Rock. “Western North Carolina has not received anywhere near what it needs, nor our fair share.”
The governor’s latest request comes while the federal government lags in paying for recovery compared to previous disasters. Federal funding thus far accounts for about 9% of total damage caused by Helene, Stein said Monday.
Typically, states receiving federal aid from major storms receive in the range of 40-50% of total damage, he said. States similarly impacted by major hurricanes like Katrina, Maria and Sandy saw around 70%.
Stein has previously said that the administration and Congress have “not met the moment” as North Carolina works to recover from the storm.
An already-slow of trickle of funds from Washington has slowed even further due to new regulations on spending. All expenditures more than $100,000 must now be approved by FEMA, Homeland Security secretary Kristin Noem and a committee that is part of the White House’s DOGE efforts.
“It’s taking way too long,” Stein said.
In total, Stein’s request for Congress and the White House encompasses $22.8 billion. That includes billions that have already been appropriated but require action by federal agencies.
Delays in funding have frustrated even North Carolina’s U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, a close ally of President Trump. He voted against advancing a DHS nominee in what was described as a warning shot to Noem, who must personally sign off on funding decisions.
“I’m trying to get the attention of those at DHS that are being slow to reimburse North Carolina for funds already spent,” Budd told the Raleigh News & Observer last week.
Still, the state has received several key pools of money in recent weeks.
A backlog of more than $160 million in public assistance money from FEMA was recently released. The EPA has sent $746 million to fund drinking water and sewer system repairs. And a new pool of $221 million from USDA will cover agricultural losses.
Trump has also separately approved a disaster declaration for Tropical Storm Chantal earlier this summer, allowing the state to access additional resources and aid.

(Leah Romero for Source NM)While early childhood program funding levels are “sufficient,” implementation of programs is an issue across the board, according to the most recent Early Childhood Accountability Report.
The report is released every two years and evaluates programs that “are intended to improve outcomes for children and families,” Allegra Hernandez, a Legislative Finance Committee fiscal analyst, explained to members of the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee Friday. Programs are directed at families starting at the prenatal stage up to to children 5 years of age, including Child Care Assistance; prekindergarten; the Family, Infant, Toddler Program; Home Visiting; and child welfare.
Hernandez pointed out that all indicators for healthy, safe children and their learning abilities by kindergarten and third grade were almost all worse than the previous report, despite state funding increasing from less than $200 million in Fiscal Year 2012 to $918 million in Fiscal Year 2026.
The report comes as the state gears up to begin offering universal child care on Nov. 1, following a recent announcement by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
According to the New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department, the Child Care Assistance Program assists families at 400% of the federal poverty level or below by subsidizing the cost of child care, increasing the family’s earnings. These families are either working, looking for work or in school. 
The accountability report states that participating families at 100% or less than the federal poverty level have declined since 2019, as well as the capacity to assist these specific families. Hernandez said that while expanding eligibility “means that more families have access to child care assistance than ever before, the additional capacity disproportionately serves higher-income families.” 
She suggested state policies should focus on “low-income, at-risk families” going forward. She also noted that the decreased capacity was largely due to a loss of registered childcare homes between 2019 and 2023.
According to the report, children enrolled in PreK have higher assessment scores and high school graduation rates compared to children enrolled in child care. LFC Program Evaluator Garrett Moseley told committee members that enrollment included about 15,000 3- and 4-year-olds in the 2024-2025 school year, or 10 times the enrollment when the program started in 2005.
“LFC staff estimates that if 5,000 more low-income students participated in one of the highest performing prekindergartens, approximately 10% more students would enter kindergarten proficient in reading,” Moseley said. 
However, the LFC report also found significant disparities in teacher preparation between school-based and community-based programs, and Moseley said higher teacher preparation has been shown to improve educational outcomes. 
Moseley also explained that participation in the state’s Family, Infant, Toddler Program — which provides early intervention for children 3 and under with developmental delays and disabilities — has increased since 2022. He said this could mean more eligible children are enrolling, or that more New Mexico children are at risk for delays. The program is expected to serve about 17,000 children this current fiscal year, and Moseley said it is a program that would ideally see decreased enrollment over time. The report noted that more analysis is needed to understand the program’s growth and “what population” it should be serving.
State Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) said she found Moseley and the report’s interpretation of the program problem, and pointed out that FIT has received national recognition for identifying children with developmental delays.
Moseley went on to explain that participation in the state’s various Home Visiting programs, which provide education and support for expecting families and those with children under 5 years old, is “significantly lower” than national participation rates, which are low to begin with. 
“Child maltreatment rates for families enrolled in Home Visiting increased from 0.62% in fiscal year 2021 to 1% in fiscal year 2024,” he said. “Although there are several factors that may contribute to this increase, it is important the state continues to monitor how providers deliver Home Visiting to ensure it is delivered as intended.”
Hailey Heinz, director of policy, research and quality initiatives at ECECD, told lawmakers that she appreciates the accountability report and that while the “vision” of the department is to create a “universal, family-centered, high quality and community-based early childhood system,” it is still a work in progress.
She emphasized the department’s recent announcement of free universal child care beginning Nov. 1. The department’s proposed rule changes involve waiving income eligibility requirements for families.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LHHS-Friday3-1-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-15 13:01:00.120542

Sandy Pickert, shown here at Gov. Laura Kelly's State of the State address on Jan. 15, 2025, used her experience as a nurse to advise a House oversight committee in September on changes to the Kansas State Board of Nursing. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas lawmakers skewered the state agency that oversees nursing licenses, alleging it has contributed to the state’s nursing shortage and demanding action before the next legislative session.
At a Sept. 8 meeting of the House Select Committee on Government Oversight, legislators urged the Kansas State Board of Nursing to make substantial changes to policies, procedures and regulations that govern the state’s relicensing and disciplinary processes.
Legislators used words such as “perplexed,” “horrified,” and “egregious” to describe their feelings about the state nursing board and its leadership. They passed resolutions that are likely to guide future changes.
Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Stilwell Republican, hurled jabs at the board, which he described as having “no regard for human life.”
He accused the agency of being filled with “power-hungry individuals that are ruining people’s lives,” and he favored extracting some of the board’s $4 million budget to share with those he thinks have been wronged by the board.
Over months of hearings, the committee has listened to hours of testimony from health care professionals. The testimony detailed the nursing board’s delays in licensing, inadequate communication, leadership issues, dated technology, inconsistent fees for the same infractions, clerical errors, coercion, conflicts of interest, flawed investigations and an approach to discipline with “an attitude of guilty until proven innocent,” said Rep. Sandy Pickert, a Wichita Republican.
Pickert does not sit on the oversight committee. She is a nurse and has followed the committee’s hearings.
“Pandora’s box is open,” she said.
Brenda Sharpe, a board member, said the board agrees with some recommendations for change.
“This board would like more tools in its toolbox,” she said.
She also strongly encouraged the committee to consider facts and circumstances not available in an open forum, referencing the long list of testimony about individual disciplinary cases. She maintained the board has acted in good faith, taking into account facts and circumstances “that may appear one way to this group but, in fact, we believe are another.”
“I would never say we follow everything perfectly,” Sharpe said. “We’re human beings. The licensees are human beings. This is a human process. That’s where we’re at.”
Michael Schommer told the committee about his 23-year-old son, Connor, who is on the autism spectrum and was diagnosed with depression. Connor attempted suicide twice, Schommer said. It wasn’t until the family found a nurse, Ana Ahrens, and a therapist who discovered the perfect combination of medication and counseling that stabilized Connor, he said.
“You know, she has a unique, no-nonsense, stern yet compassionate method of getting his attention, and he would look her in the eye and respond to the questions she was asking him,” Schommer said. “She held him accountable for what he was doing and started to get through to him.”
But then Ahrens made an error while renewing her licenses online. The state nursing board revoked her prescribing privileges, and Ahrens couldn’t refill Connor Schommer’s medication.
Michael Schommer and his wife frantically tried to find another prescriber.
“It went about two weeks too far, unfortunately,” Schommer said. “And, I just — one day he got up and there he was walking through the house talking to the ceiling again for eight hours nonstop.”
That could have been prevented, Schommer said, expressing confusion about the nursing board’s procedures.
“Thank God we still have him today, and he’s doing much better,” Schommer said.
Schommer’s story was one of dozens, but its gravity struck legislators and underscored their crusade for change.
“He could’ve lost his son, and that’s serious,” said Rep. Barbara Ballard, a Lawrence Democrat.
The committee deliberated two resolutions that encouraged considering a grace period for nurses who are late to apply for relicensing, IT updates and regular digital notifications leading up to a nurse’s relicensing deadline. The committee also discussed changing the makeup of the state board, favoring a mix of legislative and gubernatorial appointments.
The resolutions allude to a bill for the 2026 session, but lawmakers urged the board to review its policies without legislative action. The committee also discussed the possibility of a future subcommittee that could provide further recommendations.
The nursing board is responsible for more than 70,000 Kansas nurses.
Maggie Ortiz, a nurse from Texas who advocates across the country for changing nursing regulations, said the issues Kansas is facing are not unique.
“The elephant in the room is the investigative process,” she said.
House lawmakers expressed frustration with the lack of oversight of the board. Complaints about the board are investigated by the board, leading to concerns about conflicts of interest.
Rep. Susan Humphries, a Wichita Republican, said disciplinary processes seem inconsistent, which many legislators on the committee find egregious.
Rep. Emil Bergquist, a Wichita Republican who was sitting on the committee Monday as a substitute, said he didn’t think nurses in Kansas are being protected. And disciplinary processes seem “like a knifepoint rather than a corrective point,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sandy-Pickert--1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-15 13:01:00.120542

Catherine Cortez Masto)When Linda Wadleigh was a forestry major at Utah State University she came upon her first summer job as a firefighter, a role that led to a 30-year career in wildland fire management with the U.S. Forest Service.
After years in the field, she and a handful of other women firefighters decided to create a boot camp to recruit and prepare other women to become firefighters through hands-on training and classroom learning opportunities.
Trump administration advances plan to reverse federal rule that limits logging in national forests

“I didn’t see many other women, and I just wanted them to have the same chance that I did, to see what a great career this is,” Wadleigh said.
The Women in Wildfire Boot Camp program was established in 2011 and continued for more than a decade before it was terminated in February because of President Donald Trump’s executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.
As part of Trump’s sweeping plan to eliminate all DEI programs from the federal government, his administration has issued dozens of orders cutting support from government initiatives to promote more diversity.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 About 84% of federal wildland firefighters are men, according to U.S. Government Accountability Office

At a July 10 U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, U.S. Forest Service Acting Chief Tom Schultz was asked to explain why the boot camp program was eliminated. He responded, “there are still ample opportunities for all firefighters to be trained without singling out solely women.”
About 84% of federal wildland firefighters are men, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The U.S. Forest Service boot camp was launched to bring new firefighters, especially women, into a field that has historically struggled with worker retention.
The boot camp provides a structured path to becoming a wildland firefighter, but graduates still need to apply and once hired all new recruits receive the same fire training and must meet the same physical standards.
After the program’s success in Arizona and New Mexico, it expanded into 14 national forests across several Western states. It was also adopted by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. At the program’s height, it trained and recruited over 200 people a year.
“We’ve recruited hundreds of applicants, that’s a great number to work with. We don’t want to lose that when we have trouble filling all our jobs,” said Wadleigh, who hired firefighters in her position as a district ranger at the Coconino National Forest in northern Arizona before retiring last year.
Those recruits went on to fight wildfires in surrounding states, including Nevada, as U.S. wildfires have grown more severe in recent years.
 Women firefighters urge Trump administration to reinstate training program

Linda Chappell, another firefighter who helped run boot camps, said she knew the program had legs by the third year when it started regularly receiving more applicants than available slots.
“Women don’t know they can have this job, or women are hesitant to jump in for an entire fire season. After getting them in for a week of training they knew if they loved it or didn’t,” Chappell said, who retired in 2021 as an intermountain regional fuels program manager.
Both women are working with several members of Congress to urge the Trump administration to reinstate the program, saying its elimination will exacerbate the shortage of federal firefighters.
The Forest Service has lost more than 1,400 fire-certified federal workers since February as part of the Trump administration’s work to reduce the size of government. The agency has also recently asked firefighters to work more hours amid the staffing cuts.
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nevada, and six other senators on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee sent a letter to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior on Friday requesting an explanation for the elimination of the boot camp program and its immediate reinstatement.
Idaho Department of Lands seeks to balance pending budget cuts with firefighting needs

“Thousands of firings at land management agencies across the country have already left land managers understaffed for upcoming fire seasons. We are concerned the elimination of this program will exacerbate this issue,” reads the letter.
The National Interagency Fire Center reports the U.S. has experienced more than 48,000 wildfires that have burned through more than four million acres across dozens of states this year.
“Eliminating a successful outreach program such as the [Women in Wildfire Boot Camp] unnecessarily limits recruitment to a smaller pool of potential trainees when there is already a shortage of skilled and willing potential workers,” the letter continues.
Chappell, the firefighter who helped run boot camps, said she believes the program was caught up in a sweeping DEI ban without reason.
“We think it may be just an unintended consequence. We’re not convinced that’s what they intended when the executive order was signed. So let’s go ask, is that really what was intended?” Chappell said.
However, announcements about the boot camp that are still online warn “any previously issued diversity, equity, inclusion or gender-related guidance on this webpage should be considered rescinded.”
The letter requesting an explanation for the elimination of the boot camp was also signed by U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-New Mexico), John Hickenlooper (D-Colorado), Alex Padilla (D-California), Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Angus King (I-Maine).

(Photo courtesy Elevatus Architecture)The Indiana Department of Correction is seeking $15.79 million in capital funding from the State Budget Committee to ready the Miami Correctional Facility for use under a proposed federal immigration and law enforcement agreement.
The budget committee is scheduled to meet Wednesday to consider, and possibly approve, the request.
DOC officials requested funding for “capital improvements necessary to operate a proposed detention facility at Miami Correctional Facility in order to facilitate the federal immigration and law enforcement activity,” according to the committee’s agenda.
The request would cover a series of infrastructure upgrades and equipment acquisitions, including “enhancements to perimeter fencing and lighting, temporary housing structures, modifications to the intake and processing areas, installation of drug detection and drone prevention systems, and x-ray screening equipment.”
No new construction: Feds to use 1K empty Indiana prison beds to house immigration detainees

Earlier this summer, DOC announced that the federal government plans to use up to 1,000 empty beds at Miami Correctional Facility — existing but unused capacity — to house immigration detainees.
DOC spokeswoman Annie Goeller previously said there will be no new construction or expansion of the existing Miami Correctional Facility in Bunker Hill and that the north-central Indiana prison is simply making 1,000 existing, but unused, beds available to the federal government to increase its detention capacity.
DOC’s latest figures for August showed that Miami Correctional Facility was housing 1,845 inmates in 1,862 available beds, putting it at about 99% of its capacity.
Goeller said the prison site has a total capacity of more than 3,100 beds when fully operational.
Gov. Mike Braun acknowledged concerns about potential costs to the state when he spoke about the issue last month — but he said his “goal” is that “anything we’re doing for (federal immigration officials), that we get compensated for it.”
The budget committee agenda notes that the upgrades are needed “upon execution of the agreement with the Federal Government.” It’s not clear, however, if that agreement has already been finalized, however.
In addition to DOC’s deal to provide detention space, state police and other agencies have also entered agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to collaborate on enforcement efforts across the state.
DOC also revised its long-term prison consolidation plans. Officials confirmed last month that the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City will remain open “for some time” after the new $1.2 billion Northwest Indiana Correctional Facility opens in 2027, backing away from earlier plans to shutter it.
Westville Correctional Facility, located just 14 miles south, will still close as originally planned.

(Photo by Cornell Watson for KFF Health News)Devon Price, a 15-year-old boy with autism, has attended the largest school district in North Carolina for 10 years, but he cannot read or write. His twin sister, Danielle, who is also autistic, was bullied by classmates and became suicidal.
Under federal law, public schools must provide children with disabilities a “free appropriate public education,” to give them the same opportunity to learn as other kids.
The twins’ mother, Emma Miller, and tens of thousands of other parents in the U.S. have elevated complaints to the Education Department alleging that schools and states have ignored mistreatment of their children. Those complaints are in limbo as President Donald Trump’s administration has set about dismantling the federal agency.
Trump once mocked a reporter with a disability. Earlier this year, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s inaccurate remarks about people with autism were criticized as perpetuating offensive stereotypes.
Now people like Miller are worried their children will be left behind.
“I want justice for my twins, and to sound the alarm so other special needs children are not suffering or being deprived,” said Miller, 53, who lives with her twins in Wake Forest, North Carolina.

The Education Department, which was created in 1979 and helps oversee schools and colleges in the U.S., has the authority to protect students from discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or disability. Its Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations at schools and negotiates corrective actions.
As the school year begins, families throughout the country are unsure what authority will be left to intervene on their behalf if the office is shuttered, said Hannah Russell, an advocate who works with parents in North Carolina trying to obtain educational services for their children with disabilities.
“Without the Department of Education there is no accountability,” said Russell, a former special education teacher. “Everybody is scared.”
Miller described her twins as her “miracle babies” who survived despite each weighing 1 pound at birth. Danielle Price spent the first five months of her life in a neonatal intensive care unit, and her brother, Devon, the first seven months.
She has spent years fighting for them, repeatedly taking on local and state school officials. But even when she notched victories, she said, her children did not get the help they were promised.
Miller said her children are high-functioning and verbal. She said they could have thrived academically if the school system had given them proper services.
“My children have suffered,” Miller wrote in a complaint she filed in September 2024. “The most vulnerable group of children [is] being denied a basic education.”
‘Unusual and unprecedented’
Miller says her daughter began to self-harm after classmates teased and tormented her and staff secluded her away from her bullies. The Wake County Public School System assigned Devon to a classroom with an instructional assistant who was not a licensed teacher, a violation of policy, according to state documents.
Last year, Miller filed a complaint against Wake County schools with the federal Office for Civil Rights. She alleged the district did not reevaluate her kids to determine their special education needs, did not respond for months to her records requests, and retaliated against her by wrongly withdrawing the twins from the school district.
Wake County schools violated policy when staff did not address the effects of bullying on Danielle, says an April 2024 letter from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.
The school system’s education plan for Danielle “was not appropriate considering the student’s unmet social-emotional needs, which resulted in the student’s increased anxiety,” the letter says.
State officials concluded in June 2024 that the school system failed to develop, review, and revise an education plan for Devon, assigned him to a teacher assistant instead of a licensed teacher, and did not provide technology that could help him learn, according to documents.
While the decisions validated Miller’s concerns, she said that the district continues to violate her children’s rights and that the state is now ignoring her pleas for help.
“No one is taking responsibility,” she told KFF Health News. “It has been a nightmare.”
But after she appealed to the federal government last year, the Education Department sent her a letter in March saying it would not look into the complaint.
For decades, parents and advocates for people with disabilities have said the system makes it difficult for them to win against school districts, because the process is often time-consuming, confusing, and, if a family hires a lawyer, expensive. Now they say families could soon face even bigger hurdles.
On March 11, the day the Education Department sent Miller’s denial letter, the agency announced it was firing nearly half its 4,133 employees. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the move was “a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system.”
Officials shuttered seven of the 12 regional offices of the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, leaving a skeleton staff to investigate thousands of complaints filed each year, according to attorneys and advocates for the disabled.
Trump, acting on a campaign promise to shrink the federal government, later signed an executive order to eliminate the Education Department, which he said had failed children and built a bloated bureaucracy.
The president instructed officials to “return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Parents and advocacy groups say that would allow local authorities to police themselves at a time when schools remain racially segregated, some selective colleges accept male applicants at higher rates than female applicants, and students with disabilities are struggling to recover academically from the covid pandemic, more so than their peers. Also, they note, the federal laws protecting disabled and disadvantaged children emerged because of state-level failures.
Under North Carolina law, children with disabilities should be reevaluated by schools every three years to help determine their individual needs. But Miller said Wake County officials for nearly a decade refused her requests to have her kids reevaluated. She said it finally happened in late 2024.
“I never expected getting an education for my children would be such a problem,” Miller said.
The Education Law Center, the NAACP, and other advocacy groups have sued to stop Trump’s plans, alleging the changes are illegal and pose a threat to the education of students from vulnerable groups. Some 20 states and the District of Columbia sued to halt the plan, but the Supreme Court ruled in July that the Trump administration could move ahead while the case proceeded through the courts.
Russell said she has heard North Carolina school districts are promising to provide accommodations for students with disabilities, such as extra time on tests.
But families who cannot afford to hire an attorney could find themselves at a disadvantage when disagreements arise over services that cost districts more money, Russell said.
The Trump administration has decimated the Office for Civil Rights’ ability to properly investigate a backlog of thousands of complaints, said Robert Kim, who leads the Education Law Center.
The office reported receiving nearly 23,000 complaints in fiscal 2024, the highest number ever. About 8,400, or 37%, involved allegations of disability discrimination.

Black children and those with disabilities may suffer the worst consequences, since they disproportionately face harsh discipline at school, including physical restraint and isolation in seclusion rooms, Kim said.
The Education Department says children with disabilities make up 14% of students but 75% of those secluded and 81% of those physically restrained.
Black children constitute about 15% of students but 42% of those who are mechanically restrained using a device or equipment.
“Something unusual and unprecedented is happening,” Kim said about what he sees as a shift in the federal government’s responsibility to keep children safe and provide a high-quality education.
The Education Department’s press office declined an interview request for this story in an unsigned email that was copied to agency officials Madison Biedermann, Savannah Newhouse, Julie Hartman, and Ellen Keast.
White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond to a request for comment.
In a July statement, McMahon said her agency is performing all of its duties: “We will carry out the reduction in force to promote efficiency and accountability and to ensure resources are directed where they matter most — to students, parents, and teachers.”
‘Nothing but problems’
Danielle and Devon Price entered 10th grade at Wake Forest High School in August. Their mother said she is uncertain what will happen to them.
Danielle wants to go to college, but her math skills are at a fourth-grade level, school records show.
Like many youths with autism, Danielle struggles with changes in routine, and her mother said she became despondent when school officials repeatedly changed her classes to keep her away from a boy who bullied her. Soon after that, Danielle started to self-harm, Miller said, adding that her daughter receives intensive therapy.
“It has been nothing but problems” with Wake County schools, she said. “It is like no one cares.”
Wake County school officials declined to answer questions about Miller’s complaints, citing privacy laws.
In a written statement, district spokesperson Matthew Dees said that “the school district has worked hard to reach agreement with Ms. Miller on many issues” and remedied complaints that were substantiated.
“The district disputes the remaining allegations in the various complaints she has raised, including the many accusations against various staff,” Dees added.
Under federal law, parents have 180 days from the time of the last alleged violation to file a complaint with the Education Department. Miller submitted her complaint Sept. 12, 2024, exactly 180 days after she says her twins were last denied a “free appropriate public education.”

But the Office for Civil Rights said that was too late. Officials declined to waive the time limit for Miller, who had asked for an exception, according to its March denial letter.
She said she spent months fighting with Wake County school officials and did not turn to federal government sooner because she hoped she could resolve the issues locally.
Miller fears for her children’s future unless something changes at school.
“I’m a single parent, and one day I won’t be here,” she said. “My kids are going to be adults soon, yet my son doesn’t know how to read and write. I’m like, ‘Wow.’ There really is no help here.”

In January 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged registered nurse Lorraine Anderson of Salix with falsification of records and with failing to evaluate or report the status of a patient as required.
According to board records, Anderson was employed by Sioux City’s Park View Homes, a 45-bed intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities, for approximately 17 years, most recently as the facility’s director of nursing.

State records show that in February 2024, the state agency that inspects nursing homes, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, determined that a physician’s orders for several of the facility residents’ medications were missing. A DIAL inspector found that the last orders on file for the residents, which were good for 90 days, had been signed in October 2023 and were expired.
According to board records, the inspector was informed two days later that Anderson had found more recent orders for 14 residents of the home. The inspector noted the newly discovered orders appeared to have been signed by Dr. Brianna Brownlee in November 2023 — which was odd given that the October 2023 orders would not have expired at that point.
DIAL did not cite Park View Homes for any violations related to the records, but in March 2024, the Board of Nursing began to investigate. According to the board, one of its investigators spoke to Dr. Brownlee, who allegedly denied signing the 14 orders and said she suspected Anderson had forged her signature on the documents.
The board investigator then spoke to Anderson, who allegedly denied forging Brownlee’s signature. According to board records, Anderson asserted the 14 orders had been found in a locked storage room, and she reportedly suggested that a resident of the home must have accessed the documents somehow and forged the signatures.
Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Anderson.
At a subsequent disciplinary hearing on the matter, Administrative Law Judge Kristine Dreckman concluded there was sufficient evidence to show Anderson was the individual who had forged the physician’s signature on residents’ medication orders.
At the hearing, the state offered no argument or evidence to support the board’s charge that Anderson had also failed to evaluate or report the status of a patient as required, and that charge was dismissed.
Dreckman then issued a proposed decision, later approved by the board, suspending Anderson’s nursing license and stipulating that she cannot apply for reinstatement for at least one year.
The order stipulates that at the time of her application for reinstatement, Anderson must show it is in the public interest for her license to be reinstated and provide evidence that she has completed 12 hours of educational coursework related to professional ethics and medical documentation.

Casey Crabtree, R-Madison, speaks on the South Dakota Senate floor on March 3, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Madison Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree formally announced Monday that he is running for South Dakota’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives next year, pledging to carry out President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda.
“I am the only conservative Republican in this race who has always delivered on an ‘America First,’ ‘South Dakota Always’ agenda,” Crabtree said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight.
Crabtree works in economic development for Heartland Energy, a wholesale electrical power provider. He said his background in energy development, creating jobs and helping “rural communities thrive” is what President Trump is looking for.
Jackley calls for improved legal immigration policy while launching his campaign for Congress

Other declared candidates include Republican Attorney General Marty Jackley, Democratic nonprofit executive Billy Mawhiney, of Sioux Falls, and Democratic former U.S. Department of Agriculture employee Nikki Gronli, of rural Dell Rapids. Another Democrat, Scott Schlagel, of Dell Rapids, has filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission.
The House seat is up for grabs next year because U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, is running for governor.
Crabtree said he is the best fit for the job, pointing to legislation he has helped enact in South Dakota. The list includes a temporary sales tax reduction, a ban on sanctuary policies for unauthorized immigration, a tax refund for gas stations to incentivize ethanol use, a $200 million fund for housing infrastructure, and several annual freezes on state university tuition.
“When you look at that huge list of things, that is the America First agenda, and that is us delivering on that,” Crabtree said.
Crabtree was appointed to the state Senate in 2020 by then-Gov. Kristi Noem, and he served as majority leader in 2023 and 2024. He lost his leadership position following his prime sponsorship of Senate Bill 201 in 2024.
The bill would have implemented new protections for landowners and counties impacted by the construction of a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline, but would have stopped short of preventing pipeline companies from using a legal process known as eminent domain to gain land access from unwilling landowners. Opponents of the pipeline referred the legislation to the ballot, where voters rejected it, and a divide in the Republican Party over the bill played a role in 14 incumbent Republicans losing their seats during the June 2024 primary election. The winners of those races helped enact a ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines earlier this year.
“I’ll never apologize for fighting for farmers and ranchers,” Crabtree said when asked about the 2024 bill’s potential impact on his campaign. “It’s something that I’ve always done and I will always continue to do.”

The carbon pipeline project would capture and sequester some of the corn-based ethanol industry’s CO2 emissions in an attempt to gain tax credits and access markets demanding less carbon-intensive fuels. Crabtree has said the effort supports President Trump’s agenda of ensuring energy dominance while creating more demand for corn.
When asked about Trump’s tariff policies, which some in agriculture have criticized, Crabtree defended them.
“For far too long, countries like China haven’t held up their end of the deal and they hurt American businesses, American workers, and certainly hurt our family farmers,” he said. “The president is the ultimate deal maker, and I’m confident that he’s going to use tariffs in the short term to negotiate better trade deals for American workers and our family farmers.”
When asked if Trump is hard enough on Russia and whether he should do more to aid Ukraine, Crabtree said Trump is handling the situation “perfectly.” He said Trump is trying to end the war,  something “Biden never did.”
“He needs strong allies like myself who will be serving in Congress to make sure he can deliver on that America First Agenda,” Crabtree said.
Crabtree grew up in Arlington, graduated from Northern State University in Aberdeen, and lives in Madison with his wife, Ashley, and their two sons. Ashley owns an optometry practice.
The Republican primary for the congressional seat, which would pit Crabtree against Jackley and any other Republican candidates who arise, is June 2, 2026. The general election will be Nov. 3, 2026.

Tony Evers is suing the Wisconsin State Legislature for clarification on administrative rulemaking powers after a state Supreme Court decision earlier this year found that lawmakers were unconstitutionally blocking administrative rules indefinitely. 
Since the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s Evers v. Marklein II decision in July, Evers has taken steps to implement 12 administrative rules that were approved by him, but without getting the sign off from committees. His administration has said the additional approval isn’t needed. 
However, Republican lawmakers have objected to Evers implementing the rules without going through the legislative committees, instructing the Legislative Reference Bureau not to publish any rule that hasn’t gone through a review by the Legislature in accordance with Wisconsin law. 
“The Legislature cannot continue to indefinitely obstruct my administration from doing the people’s work — and the Wisconsin Supreme Court agrees, but Republican lawmakers are continuing their unlawful behavior anyway,” Evers said in a statement about the court filing. “At the end of the day, this lawsuit is about following the law and making sure there’s accountability for elected officials if they fail to do so. It shouldn’t take going to court to get Republican lawmakers to comply with state law and Supreme Court decisions, but it seems like that’s what it’s going to take, unfortunately.” 
Evers argues in the filing in Dane County Circuit Court that the state law that barred agencies from publishing rules that hadn’t gone through the Joint Committee on the Review of Administrative Rules was invalidated under the state Supreme Court ruling. 
“No statute bars agencies from promulgating final administrative rules pending a legislative committee’s review,” the filing argued. “And even if any such statute existed, it would be facially unconstitutional under Evers II… a legislative committee cannot have discretion over a pre-promulgation pause without violating constitutional bicameralism and presentment procedures. Such a statute would also unconstitutionally intrude on the executive branch’s authority to execute statutes that authorize administrative rulemaking.”
Evers is asking for a declaration and an injunction that orders the Legislative Reference Bureau must publish the nine rules the Evers Administration has already submitted and all administrative rules that have completed all preceding rulemaking procedures and been approved by the governor. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said in a statement that Evers is directing agencies to violate “valid” parts of Wisconsin law that “no court has ever questioned, let alone found to be invalid in any respect.”
“Just because Governor Evers is now a lame duck who no longer believes he is accountable to the people, it does not give him the right to ignore laws that the Legislature enacted, and a prior occupant of his office signed,” the Republican leaders said. “That’s not how the rule of law works.”

“The details of that will be (released) down the road, but we wanted to at least give you that much about mindset for him,” Kelley said in a press conference outside of the school Thursday.
Students hospitalized after Evergreen High School shooting; suspected shooter dead

Officials have identified the shooting suspect as 16-year-old Desmond Holly, who died at a Lakewood hospital on Wednesday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound he sustained after the shooting. The suspect’s family has been cooperative with authorities as they investigate and plan to search his home, phone and school locker, Kelley said.
The Denver Post reported later Thursday that social media accounts apparently belonging to the suspect were filled with white supremacist content, posts exhibiting a fascination with mass shootings and reposted videos that “were explicitly antisemitic or depicted people in Nazi uniforms.”
The two victims of the shooting — 18-year-old Matthew Silverstone and another student who has not yet been identified — remained in critical condition at local hospitals, where Kelley said there is security present.
The suspect used a revolver handgun that he repeatedly fired and reloaded, which Kelley said “went on and on.” As the shooting went on, he was unable to access areas of the school that had gone into lockdown.
“He tried to find new targets, and he came up against a roadblock on many of those doors,” Kelley said. “He couldn’t get to those kids.”

Silverstone’s family released a brief statement through the sheriff’s office on Thursday.
“The family appreciates the community’s concern and support, but as we remain focused on our loved one’s recovery, we respectfully request privacy as we continue to heal and navigate the road ahead,” the statement said.
The name of the second victim has not yet been released.
Students and staff at the school “did their job, they did it well, and lives were saved yesterday because of the actions they took” during the lockdown, Kelley said. Many students ran and fled the scene while others remained locked down in the school.
Kelley had no information on how the suspect obtained the weapon.
Multiple agencies are supporting the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office in the investigation “because there’s so many crime scenes within the school and outside the school,” Kelley said. Many windows and lockers within the school were shot.
The high school will not reopen this week.

But for the attorneys general of New Hampshire and 24 other Republican-led states, it’s a novelty that highlights what they say is a problem with Massachusetts’ gun laws.
A New Hampshire resident who might be legally carrying a firearm on the New Hampshire side of the parking lot might find that same firearm illegal to carry to the Massachusetts side without a permit.
The 25 states say that arrangement is unconstitutional. This month, they’re taking that argument to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“If that person is carrying a firearm without a Massachusetts license — which would be constitutionally protected activity in most of the mall — that person risks being charged as a felon and facing mandatory incarceration in Massachusetts,” reads a brief from the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office to the U.S. Supreme Court, speaking about a visitor to the Pheasant Lane Mall.
Led by New Hampshire, the states have come together to support the efforts of Philip Marquis, of Rochester, New Hampshire, to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to protect non-Massachusetts residents from the Bay State’s firearms regulations. In an amici — or “friend of the court” — brief, lawyers at the New Hampshire Department of Justice say Massachusetts’ firearms permitting law should not apply to travelers from other states passing through.
Also joining the amici brief are the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, meanwhile, asserts the law can apply to visitors and is constitutional. And the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has agreed.
If the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the case, the conservative majority could apply a landmark 2022 decision that limited state firearms regulations to rule in favor of Marquis. And the result could dramatically change relations between gun-owning New Hampshire residents and those of its southern neighbor.
But the Supreme Court has been hesitant to take up challenges to gun laws in recent years that could help clarify its 2022 decision. And that has meant a backlog of cases against state firearm restrictions — and potentially the Marquis case — have been left unresolved recently, according to Joseph Blocher, a law professor and co-founder of the Duke Center for Firearms Law.
“I think the pressure is high on the Supreme Court to weigh in again. But they have not,” Blocher said in an interview. “They did not show much of an appetite for it for most of the last 20 years.”
Marquis previously brought a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the state’s court system, arguing that the state’s concealed carry firearms permit law is unnecessarily burdensome to out-of-state visitors. In March, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied his claims and ruled that the state law passed constitutional muster.
Now, Marquis is requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to overrule the Massachusetts high court’s decision on federal constitutional grounds. In order for that to happen, the federal court must grant Marquis a “writ of certiorari,” which would allow them to accept arguments and hold an oral hearing.
For Marquis, the effort is personal; he is trying to overturn a conviction. In 2022, Marquis was driving on Interstate 495 when he got into an accident and pulled his car into the breakdown lane, according to his legal petition. At the time, he had an unloaded pistol in his pocket. When state police officers arrived to talk to him, Marquis announced that he had the pistol and removed it from his pocket.
He told police officers that he did not have a Massachusetts firearm license, but that he is legally allowed to carry a concealed firearm in New Hampshire because he has not been disqualified under federal law. New Hampshire state law allows the automatic concealed carry of firearms for anyone not federally disqualified; Massachusetts requires residents and non-residents to obtain a license by paying $100 and receiving approval from the colonel of the state police.
Because he was carrying the gun without a license, police charged Marquis with unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition under Massachusetts state law, and a lower court convicted him.
Marquis has appealed that decision all the way to the highest Massachusetts court, and in doing so he’s invoked a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that has upended state firearms laws. In New York State Rifle & Police Association, Inc. v. Bruen, the court struck down a New York law that required residents to show “proper cause” in order to obtain a concealed carry permit.
In that decision, the court held that any state law that awards firearms permits on a discretionary basis, known as a “may issue” permitting law, is unconstitutional; only a law that awards permits on strict criteria — a “shall issue” permitting law — could be constitutional under the Second Amendment. And Bruen established that any state firearms restriction must adhere to the historical tradition of firearms regulation dating back to the passage of the Constitution — or be explicitly covered by the Second Amendment itself.
Now, as Marquis attempts to bring his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, his challenge of the Massachusetts law could represent an opportunity for the court to expand the range of gun rights in the wake of the Bruen decision and limit Massachusetts’ regulatory power.
Neither Marquis nor the Republican attorneys general supporting his lawsuit are attempting to overturn Massachusetts’ firearms permitting law as it applies to Massachusetts residents. But they are seeking to establish that the law should not apply to out-of-state residents whose home states have less restrictive regulations.
And to do it, they are attempting to show that the state law violated Marquis’ Second Amendment right to bear arms and 14th Amendment right to travel and equal protection — and that, following Bruen, no historical reading of those amendments justifies applying Massachusetts’ law to out-of-state residents.
In their briefs, attorneys for Marquis and attorneys for the Republican states argue the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was wrong to decide that the state’s concealed carry permit law qualifies as a “shall issue” permitting law under Bruen. In reality, they say, the decision-making by the state police colonel makes the process a “may issue,” and thus unconstitutional.
In its March ruling, the Supreme Judicial Court held that Marquis did not have standing to sue in Massachusetts court, but that even if he did, his challenge of the state law would not succeed. The court found that the state law passed the Bruen test because it attempts to restrict dangerous people from obtaining firearms, which it held follows historical tradition.
“To the extent that the Commonwealth restricts the ability of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms within its borders, the justification for so doing is credible, individualized evidence that the person in question would pose a danger if armed,” the state court’s decision read. “Both case law and the historical record unequivocally indicate that this justification is consistent with ‘the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.’”
Clark Neily, the senior vice president for legal studies of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, disagrees. The Cato Institute, a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights, has also filed an amicus brief in Marquis’ petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, in which it argues that a contextual reading of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War, indicates that its framers would have intended it to protect the firearms rights of freed slaves traveling to safer states.
“If you’ve been enslaved in Alabama, you sure want to get out of there and go and look for better economic opportunities in other states,” he said in an interview Thursday. “Now, you’re most certainly going to encounter the (Ku Klux Klan) at some point while you’re looking for work in other states. And guess what? You’re going to want to be able to be able to protect yourself, and not have to encounter some state regulation like they have in Massachusetts.”
It is not clear whether the court will take up Marquis’ appeal, nor when it might make its decision. Despite its decision in Bruen, the conservative court has held back from dramatically expanding the scope of the Second Amendment. In 2024, it narrowed the scope of Bruen‘s in U.S. v. Rahimi, which affirmed the constitutionality of firearm restrictions for defendants in domestic violence case. But it has declined to take up a number of attempts to challenge state firearms restrictions in Democratic-led states, including two cases in Massachusetts, Commonwealth v. Crowder and Zemene v. Commonwealth.
To Blocher, of the Center for Firearms Law, the question of whether Bruen negates out-of-state firearms license requirements is just one of many legal questions that have emerged in caselaw across the country since the 2022 decision. Federal lower courts are grappling with what Bruen means for gun possession by felons; location-based firearm restriction laws such as gun-free school zones; age restrictions; caps on high-capacity magazines; state bans on assault-style rifles; and more. The historical contextual test Bruen requires has at times provided more uncertainty than clarity, he says. And circuit courts are more likely than ever to split along partisan lines.
“It kind of looks like there’s some real confusion and disagreement,” he said. “Some lower courts are even saying, ‘Look, we’re just not equipped to do this kind of historical analysis. We’ve got busy dockets. We’re not like the Supreme Court. We have to decide more than 70 cases every year, and we don’t have the benefits of experts and friend of court briefs, and this is just impossible for us.’”
With scant action from the Supreme Court, the result has been something of a backlog.
Some Second Amendment advocates, like Neily, say the current John Roberts court has failed to follow through on necessary corrections to firearms laws.
“The court has not manifested a serious commitment to vindicating the right to keep and bear arms, and one of the ways we can see that is in the numerous cases that it has turned away,” Neily said.
But the string of denials have given hope to supporters of gun restrictions, for whom Bruen had struck a blow in 2022.
“Even after Bruen, courts are upholding state, federal, and local gun laws against Second Amendment challenges,” a 2023 legal memo from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence states. “Most courts have recognized that, when properly applied, Bruen allows for a wide range of gun violence prevention laws.”

(Kansas Reflector screen capture)TOPEKA — An intensive look at the Kansas substance abuse disorder system reveals gaps in services that can be addressed to provide better care and support statewide, university researchers said.
The University of Kansas Center for Public Partnerships and Research gathered data, talked to 2,000 Kansans and explored evidence-based tactics that could change the substance abuse system.
The result was the United to Transform report, a needs assessment that was shared with the Kansas Fights Addiction Board after being commissioned by the Sunflower Foundation.
“Substance use disorder actually encompasses a range of substances, from alcohol, tobacco to opioids, amphetamines, the whole package,” said Silke von Esenwein, research lead for the project, on the Kansas Reflector podcast.
The funds from Kansas Fights Addiction were from the opioid settlement, so there was a strong focus on that class of drugs.
“But the truth is that people use a lot of things at the same time,” von Esenwein said. “It usually goes hand-in-hand with mental health issues and so we made it a point to be pretty inclusive of all the substances that people are using out there, because they’re part of the context and they’re part of what’s happening in Kansas.”


Janine Hron, co-principle investigator on the project, said she was shocked at the prevalence of substance use in Kansas. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that one in five Kansans meets the clinical criteria for substance use disorder, she said.
In addition, 95% of those people do not believe they need to change their behavior or need support in doing so, the research found.
“In that way, substance use disorder really is a factor affecting the lives of all Kansans because those one in five are people that you know,” Hron said. “They are a part of our family, they’re in our workplace, the general community structures, our faith communities, our social networks. It’s an everyday part of everybody’s life.”
The estimate of use may be an underestimate, von Esenwein said, because the survey doesn’t include people who are unhoused or incarcerated.
A needs assessment is a comprehensive look at the substance use disorder throughout the state, von Esenwein said.
“You try to identify gaps and weaknesses, but you also try to identify strengths in a system, what you can build on,” she said. “You see where do people fall through the cracks? What are the big burning fires? What are rising issues? We added a component, which is called futures work. We’d not only ask what is happening now, but we also did a lot of work (on) what do people want to see in the future.”
Data and information gathering were critical to the process, and the report also explored potential strategies and priorities, von Esenwein said.
Gathering information from multiple networks in communities throughout Kansas wasn’t as simple as creating focus groups, Hron said. They used strategies that allowed communities, through exercises and activities, to interpret for themselves what is happening, she said.
“We’re gathering the information about the ‘what,’ but we’re also understanding deeper about the ‘how does this manifest’ in the community,” Hron said. “For me, that was reinforcement for the exceptionally important local level kinds of look that we needed to take and how we would marry that with the very important systems-level initiatives that were going to be required.”
The substance use disorder system is large, Hron said, and involves many different players.
“That’s our challenge,” she said. “It’s the wild west right now. We, very early on, started looking at both the systems level and the local levels, and the interdependencies between those.”
 
Strengths
Hron and von Esenwein said strengths in the Kansas system showed up throughout their work. For instance, they found that while there still can be stigma around having a substance use disorder, that opinion is shifting.
“People are talking about this topic,” von Esenwein said. “There’s a really vibrant peer movement going on in Kansas that took it to the streets. They literally took it to the streets and said, ‘We are dying, and nobody cares.’ And they’re very vocal. The advocacy is much stronger.”
They also talked to clinicians who said it used to be a “‘party conversation stopper” to talk about their profession and now people respond positively, she said.
Hron said insights from a group of eight people — they called them the “accountability cohort” — who had lived experience with substance use were helpful in shaping questions and how researchers looked at the individual experience and community-level supports.
“They were the ones who really articulated for us what that individual journey looks like, and this lack of mattering, it was really heartbreaking to me,” she said, referring to individuals who felt like they didn’t matter to anyone.
“They also talked about the point where something clicks and the process of change started, and what that took, the hope, the connection, the community that is required to do that successfully,” Hron said.
 
Challenges
The report highlights key findings, including:
Most (93 of 101) hospitals in frontier and rural Kansas communities are financially unstable, and they offer opportunities to meet substance use disorder (SUD) needs. In 2023, 29% of all SUD patients required emergency or crisis services.
There is a severe lack of access to medical detoxification and Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD). These medications are essential and are considered gold standard for treatment. Kansas 2023 medical claims data show treatment including medical detoxification in less than 1% of all people receiving care, and use of MOUD occurring in fewer than 4% of cases.
Pharmacies operate in 103 out of 105 counties, making them one of the most accessible health care points for individuals seeking care.
“The role of our hospitals, particularly in the rural parts of the state, is absolutely essential,” Hron said. “Right now, they are triaging and dealing with emergencies and that sort of thing, but there’s a much bigger role that they could be playing.”
Hospitals and pharmacies could be touchpoints for people with SUD, but in general, the system is fragmented, von Esenwein said.
“That’s not news, right? Like, people know that, but we were able to find much more details that give us kind of entry points,” she said. “We know, for instance, that youth and the elderly population, over 85, have a particularly hard time finding care. We also were able to identify where care breaks down after people come out of treatment, and what is not there right now to make people successful.”
Von Esenwein said the lack of evidence-based practices being used and failure to use medical detoxification drugs in Kansas was “stunning” to the team.
“That kind of evidence-based practice — we know what works — isn’t really happening in Kansas,” she said. “We know medications for opioid use disorder are the No. 1 way to save lives. We know it’s very effective. Less than 5% of people that are in treatment are getting it.”
Medication-assisted withdrawal can make all the difference for someone trying to stop using drugs, and von Esenwein said that’s not happening in the state. Instead, social withdrawal, meaning stopping use without medication supports, is typically what occurs.
“That might be in a medical setting, but without a medication that we know makes it easier to come out of it,” she said.
 
Community matters
Every community is different, and the people and systems there have different needs, Hron and von Esenwein said.
The Kansas Fights Addiction board will have numerous opportunities to meet needs in Kansas based on what researchers found, she said.
“I think the board has a chance to really support what we know works, which is strong prevention efforts, medications for treatment, treatments that are not in residential settings for three months that nobody can afford, that are way too expensive, and people can’t just leave their children, parents, whatever, behind to go,” von Esenwein said.
Creating a continuum of care that supports people with substance use disorder is possible, she said.
“We are really pleasantly surprised by the energy and the readiness of people throughout the state to do something about this,” von Esenwein said. “This is usually a topic people kind of shy away from and are reluctant to talk about, but people are fired up and they’re ready to talk.”
Webinars pulling together people in the SUD system from across the state were a special highlight of the process, Hron said. People were excited to share information and to compare what was happening in other communities.
“Kansans are resourceful and they’re practical,” von Esenwein said. “I think that we can really capitalize on that. I think people are ready. We talked to lots of people with lots of connections, and we’re in a pretty good position to actually move forward and do something. It made us very optimistic.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SUDresearch16x9-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-15 10:57:08.861233

(Photo courtesy of NBC12)Major flooding that battered the commonwealth last year after Hurricane Helene and the Presidents Day flooding earlier this year, showed that communities across the state — not just on the coast — need to know the potential impact of storms. As a result and because of recent legislation, the state is working to update its flood protection plan, 20 years after the last update to it, for how communities can tackle flooding.
The first iteration of the Virginia Flood Protection Master Plan is due by the end of next year. The Flood Resiliency Advisory Committee was created through recent legislation and is made up of representatives focused on housing, environmental quality, emergency management, and transportation. The committee’s aim is to fill in gaps in data between federal and local agencies to help localities make long-term plans for flood resilience.
“The risk is managed across multiple programs and policies, and a lot of that then flows down to local governments to implement,” said Matt Dalon, program manager for the Office of Resilience Planning. “We’re looking for opportunities to coordinate and enhance our work so we’re more efficient and effective in our policies and programs to manage the flood risk across the Commonwealth.”
This work is being done in tandem with the second phase of the Coastal Resilience Master Plan to use future rainfall projections to aid in long range plans. The first phase of the coastal plan was released in 2021. Over 70% of Virginia’s population calls the coastal region home.
FEMA currently does not take into account future rainfall projections when formulating its flood maps, according to Dalon. On the local level there is often not enough resources or funding to conduct rainfall projections when making city or county resiliency plans.
“But historically, precipitation and rainfall driven flooding has been absent from a lot of the planning process because it’s not included entirely in the FEMA data. So there’s been kind of this gap,” Dalon said.
The plan will not have directives or specific projects laid out for flood mitigation. It will focus on connecting agencies, training on how to respond to flooding, and reliable data for localities to use in their own planning. 
“I mean, it’s just not realistic to think we’re going to have zero flood risk. But start making changes now and sticking to it and continue to build that momentum so that we are seeing these long term reductions while also dealing with the more immediate items that come up,” Dolan said.
State agencies are currently working with stakeholders and communities who are heavily impacted by flooding, or are projected to be in the future, to gain ideas of how localities can look at how other areas of the state are mitigating flood risks that may be similar to what they may face in the future.

Intentionally lying about elections could draw a fine under a new bill proposed by Michigan Senate Democrats.
A bill reintroduced by Sen. Mary Cavanagh, a Democrat from Redford Township, would impose a $1,000 fine on anyone who knowingly lies about elections or a voter’s eligibility. Employers who had someone working for them “for election-related purposes” violate the provision — such as a lobbyist who suggests certain groups aren’t eligible to vote early — could face a fine of up to $10,000.
The goal is to deter election-related misinformation in a critical swing state, Cavanagh said during a Senate Elections and Ethics Committee hearing Wednesday. Such efforts “can cause confusion, reduce voter turnout, and ultimately undermine the legitimacy of our electoral system,” she said.
Last fall, activists including Elon Musk seized on a misleading claim that Michigan has more voters than eligible residents to suggest that something was wrong with the state’s voter rolls. The claim made significant ripples on social media, but it’s the same claim that has been debunked extensively by the state as well as independent experts.
Cavanagh’s proposal would target only those who “maliciously” spread false information, she said.
“We worked very closely with the ACLU as well as the Secretary of State’s office, the AG and municipal government to make sure we’re not infringing on anyone’s rights or someone just passing information to their neighbor,” Cavanagh said.
But others fear how such a law would be enforced. Sen. Ruth Johnson, a Republican from Holly and the minority vice chair of the Senate Elections and Ethics Committee, said she applauded the intent but that she didn’t feel “it represents really a good solution.” Johnson, a former secretary of state, said in the hearing that she believes the legislation “could be enforced in a very partisan, politically motivated way.”
Additional bills heard by the Elections Committee on Wednesday included two from Sen. Jeremy Moss, a Democrat from Southfield, aimed at people who circulate petitions and collect signatures on them for prospective ballot proposals. The bills would ban the practice of paying circulators for each signature, and would require circulators to read a summary of petitions to would-be signers or allow them to read it themselves.
“Ballot proposals should be able to stand on their own merit instead of a misleading description or another deceptive tactic to gain support,” Moss said. “Other states have put similar markers out there to restore honesty when petition circulators are talking about their ballot proposal.”
Another bill, from Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor, would allow people who sign the same petition twice to have their signature counted — but only once — toward the minimum requirement.
Each of the four bills is identical to legislation introduced late last year. Those bills passed the Senate in December, but they stalled in the House during a lame duck session that saw little progress on any issue.
The bills passed this year with support from the five Democrats on the committee. Johnson voted against each bill, while Sen. Ed McBroom, a Republican from Waucedah Township, voted “pass” on each. The bills now move to the full Senate, where they are likely to pass again.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)A panel of state lawmakers voted 9-2 on Wednesday to approve spending up to $100,000 on a lawsuit against Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
The lawsuit, if filed, would challenge the governor’s decision to press ahead with plans to create a cabinet-level Alaska Department of Agriculture via executive order.
The governor issued an executive order in January, but lawmakers rejected it in a 32-28 vote in March, saying they preferred to create it through legislation instead. Creating the department through legislation, legislative leaders said, would allow lawmakers to debate and structure the department how they wish, instead of relying on the governor’s plans alone.
Dunleavy disagrees with that approach and in August filed a new executive order during a 30-day special session.
The leaders of the House and Senate refused to accept the filing, saying that it was not within the governor’s power to issue an executive order during a special session, or to reintroduce an already-rejected order.
The governor’s office has said that lawmakers’ failure to vote down the new order means that it will take effect and allow the executive branch to create the cabinet-level department at the start of 2026.



Why does the Legislature’s failure to vote on the executive order matter?
Article III, section 23 of the Alaska Constitution says that executive orders automatically take effect “unless disapproved by resolution concurred in by a majority of the members in joint session.”
The question that could be decided in court is whether lawmakers need to take that vote if an order is issued during a special session. Is issuing an order in a special session even legal? And does it matter if the order is identical to one that’s already been issued and voted upon?



Under Article III, section 23 of the Alaska Constitution, the “legislature shall have sixty days of a regular session, or a full session if of shorter duration, to disapprove” executive orders that would make a change to the functions of the executive branch.
For almost two hours on Wednesday, members of the joint House-Senate Legislative Council — a committee that makes decisions for the Legislature when it is out of session — heard about the dispute behind closed doors, then debated it briefly in open session before voting.
“It’s a disagreement between the Legislature and the governor about whether or not the governor has the authority under the Alaska Constitution to introduce an executive order during a special session,” said Emily Nauman, director of Legislative Legal Services, the legal department for Alaska’s legislative branch.
Because the House and Senate’s presiding officers returned the order to the governor without taking action, “the governor is asserting that he will give effect to the executive order because it was not specifically rejected or disapproved by the legislature, thus causing a conflict in the interpretation of the Constitution between the Legislature and executive branch.”
Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, voted in favor of authorizing the Legislature to prepare and, if necessary, file a pre-emptive lawsuit to keep the governor from enacting the executive order.
“It’s just a question, to me, of, we said, ‘No. Don’t you understand what no means?’”
Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, also voted in favor of moving forward with a lawsuit. He said that while there is still time for the governor to back away from his position, “I really see it as our prerogative to protect ourselves procedurally, and for us to do that, I believe we need to file litigation.”
The two votes against Wednesday’s proposal came from Reps. Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, and Mike Prax, R-North Pole.
Prax said he feels as if it could set a precedent that could allow lawmakers to disapprove of a future governor’s actions in a “more urgent” situation by simply not taking action.
“We would establish a precedent that the Legislature can do something by doing nothing, and that just does not seem like a very good practice to have established for any organization,” Prax said.
Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, said he doesn’t think that’s a correct interpretation of the lawsuit.
“With great respect to Representative Prax, no one is asserting here that the Legislature may act by inaction. What is before us is the question of whether the second shot at an executive order came in a way that the Constitution allows. I am convinced it did not.”
Kopp said he believes the governor may be prepared to change course on his executive action, and he’s reluctant to approve a lawsuit unless the governor attempts to take action and actually create the department.
“I would like to see us not initiate this until there’s some overt action by the administration that clearly indicates their intent to move unilaterally on this issue outside of the legislative process,” he said.
As of Friday, there was no estimate as to when a lawsuit might be filed.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the executive branch may not sue the legislative branch. Lawsuits by the Legislature against the governor are rare; this would be the fourth against Dunleavy during his two terms in office beginning in 2018. 
In 2019, lawmakers sued the governor over a school funding issue. The governor won that case in the Alaska Supreme Court. The following year, legislators sued Dunleavy over their failure to consider some of his appointees during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. The Alaska Supreme Court again ruled in Dunleavy’s favor.
In 2022, lawmakers filed a ‘friendly’ lawsuit against the governor in a dispute over the proper handling of oil and gas tax settlements. That dispute, which dates to the administration of Gov. Bill Walker, has yet to be decided by the Alaska Supreme Court.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250519_092422-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-15 10:57:08.861233

When the ambulance doors opened Mike Lovecchio watched as one of his former students stepped out.
The student had graduated just weeks earlier and already had a job with Beaufort County Emergency Services as an emergency medical technician. He’d earned his certification his senior year and was able to walk into a career with a $60,000 starting salary.

As South Carolina’s governor’s race heats up, these are the types of programs gubernatorial candidates have called for on the campaign trail.
It’s a familiar refrain among the state’s political leadership dating back at least two decades. It’s also something state law already requires school districts to offer, though the opportunities available vary from one school district to the next.
A ‘pathway to success’
In announcing her run for the Governor’s Mansion last month, U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., told supporters she would push to create two tracks for high school students — one for the traditional student who is going to go on to a two-year or four-year degree and a second, if a student isn’t going to college, that certifies them in a vocation.
“Whether that’s plumbing, carpentry, as an electrician or a welder or getting their (commercial drivers license) or getting their cosmetology degree,” Mace said. “If you are certified in a trade and you are ready for work the day after you graduate from high school, you should be qualified to get a high school diploma equivalent to your vocational training and certification.”
But a 2005 law, known as the Education and Economic Development Act, already requires public school districts to help students identify career interests as early as middle school. Those students then enter high school with a four-year plan designed to prepare them for college or a particular job. That plan is meant to include job-training opportunities, such as internships.
Business groups tout tax credit as way to expand high-paying job opportunities in SC

By 2007, every high school was supposed to offer courses clustered around at least three different careers.
Even so, funding cuts amid the Great Recession meant even requirements for a guidance counselor in every school weren’t fully funded until 2016. The special commission formed to monitor these efforts had been dissolved for several years by that time.
“South Carolina has long been focused on preparing students for their personal post-secondary pathway to success, whether that be college, career, or the military,” according to a statement from the state Department of Education.
Graduating with credentials
More and more, schools are doing this through what is known as career and technical education, according to the K-12 education agency. Those students who complete an area of study graduate with a series of certifications that, in some career fields, can immediately land them a job.
For the 2018-19 school year, just over 19,000 students earned a nationally or state-recognized credential. By the 2023-24 school year, that number more than doubled to over 48,000 students statewide.
Still, courses of study and job-training opportunities can be lacking, especially at small rural high schools that can’t afford a wide variety.
Here’s how many are graduating from SC colleges with in-demand degrees. It’s not enough.

For example large, county-wide school districts in the major metro areas around Charleston and Myrtle Beach both had more than 1,000 students complete certifications last school year. In Greenville County, that number topped 2,500 students, according to report cards issued by the state.
Each district had 13 to 14 so-called career clusters for students to choose from representing between 25 and 50 different jobs, the district’s websites show.
But rural districts in Bamberg, Marion and Fairfield counties had fewer than 100 students earn certificates. Each district had seven clusters or less, representing about 10 jobs.
Paying off
According to the Education Department, the state is revamping its certification efforts to “ensure students aren’t just earning credentials, they’re earning the right ones: credentials that lead directly to high-demand careers where skilled workers are needed most in South Carolina.”
A student may earn a  CPR certification in 10th grade, certified nursing assistant credential by graduation and then pursue a practical nursing degree at one of the state’s technical schools, the agency gives as an example.
“Each step builds on the last, opening doors for students and giving employers candidates who are ready to contribute right away,” according to the agency.
It’s something Lovecchio said he’s already been doing at his academy teaching students in the state’s two the southernmost counties.
High school juniors and seniors enrolled in the program all start out earning more general certifications, such as the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s main workplace safety certification. Then students can pick from four career clusters representing 13 different jobs to earn more specialized credentials.
Those that complete their programs can graduate high school as licensed cosmetologists, licensed welders, ServSafe certified restaurant managers and more, Lovecchio said.
The effort pays off.
Lovecchio has two seniors in his automotive collision repair program who already have standing job offers with Boeing in North Charleston after they graduate. The summer after their junior year, the aerospace giant accepted the two into paid internships in its paint shop, even covering their housing costs for the roughly three months they were working there.

In the tourism-heavy counties of Beaufort and Jasper, which include vacation destinations such as Hilton Head, culinary workers and cosmetologists are in high demand to work at the area’s upscale resorts and restaurants.
And students in the marine tech program often get snatched up to work part time at the marinas while they’re pursuing their certifications.
Lovecchio said, even with the high cost of living in these coastal communities, students with these certifications can earn a livable starting wage without the worry of having to pay back a student loan.
And those that do choose to go on to college have a skill set they can fall back on or use to earn extra cash.
“If plan A goes wrong, you have a plan B,” he said.
Popular programs
One of the most popular certifications statewide is in the auto repair industry. Those that earn their automotive credentials are sought out by car dealerships to work in their shops, often changing oil and tires to start, said Courtney Kenyon of the S.C. Auto Dealers Association.
The auto dealers have even built on the effort with programs of their own.
Like many industries following the COVID-19 pandemic, dealerships were struggling to find enough workers.
The organization had long offered scholarship programs for students pursuing a technical college degree. Then, in 2022, the group took it a step further with its Auto Tech Development Program, Kenyon said.
Participants who sign on for the two-year program can land a paid apprenticeship with dealerships around the state, earning certifications with each of the major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Nissan. The auto dealers also supply these students with the tool sets they need, supplies that can cost upwards of $10,000.
Since the program’s start, the auto dealers have signed on 125 apprentices. And the organization has about 250 more young technicians in the queue to participate, Kenyon said.
The homebuilding industry also places a lot of weight on the certifications high schoolers can earn in areas like heating and cooling, plumbing and electric, said Home Builders Association of South Carolina President Mark Nix.

While graduating with these credentials already in hand gives students a leg up, Nix added that the construction industry also offers on-the-job training with paid apprenticeships shadowing a licensed plumber or electrician, all without the need for a college degree.
The fast-growing industry has such a strong need for workers “no one is going to turn away anyone who wants to learn,” Nix said.
State testing
While the availability of these specialized certification programs differ from district to district, the state does test all high school juniors in the state for career readiness. Through that test, students can earn a certificate to take to potential employers.
Starting with the class of 2015, South Carolina replaced its high school exit exam with these career readiness tests, pitched as being more useful to students’ future success.
When then Gov. Nikki Haley signed the law ending the states three-decade-old exit exam requirement to graduate, supporters said students would be able to list their career ready scores on work resumes or college admissions applications.
In the test’s first year, about 88% of South Carolina’s 11th-graders scored high enough to earn certificates.
The state continues to administer the test, though it has since switched to a different testing company. Last year, 55% of high school seniors graduated with a career readiness credential.
Under that test, designed by WIN Learning, students who score at least a Level 3 earn a credential. A Level 3 indicates students have the skills necessary to pursue about 59% of jobs listed by the U.S. Department of Labor.
Those positions include bookkeepers, dental assistants, firefighters, correctional officers, machinists, medical assistants, message therapists and pharmacy technicians. While the credential shows these students may have an aptitude, many jobs on the list require extra licenses and certificates.
Students are tested in four areas: math, reading, the ability to analyze data in charts and diagrams, and soft skills such as effective communication, promoting teamwork and thinking critically, according to the WIN website.
Some employers also use the test as a way to pre-screen job applicants for entry level positions.
Tire-maker Michelin requires it for its Lexington County plant, job listings show. And contractors operating the Savannah River Nuclear Site near Aiken also announced in February it would be using the test for certain, unnamed jobs.
Still, the prevalence of the test has faded.
Ready SC, an arm of the technical college system that runs worker trainings and hiring events for large companies opening operations in the state, said major manufacturers used to ask for the test more often. However, many have shifted away from it the last couple years, spokeswoman Kelly Steinhilper said.

Meanwhile, a referendum campaign seeking to repeal the map got a major financial boost over the weekend — a $500,000 donation from a national dark-money organization. 
And a lawsuit filed last week by the Missouri NAACP claiming the governor illegally called lawmakers into a special legislative session to pass the map is scheduled for a hearing Monday afternoon in Cole County Court.
The all-out assault on the congressional map in the courtroom and ballot box is the next phase of the ugly partisan war that’s raged in Missouri for weeks — with Republicans determined to follow President Trump’s instructions to create a new GOP district before the 2026 midterms and Democrats denouncing the move as an unconstitutional power grab.

Both of the lawsuits filed after the map passed Friday — one in Jackson County and the other in Cole County — argue the Missouri Constitution prohibits the legislature from redrawing congressional districts more than once a decade. 
“In a blatant illegal and unconstitutional power grab, the governor bowed to the whims of Washington while sacrificing representation in both urban and rural populations of Missouri,” said Gillian Wilcox, director of litigation for the ACLU of Missouri, which is representing plaintiffs in the Jackson County lawsuit. 
Missouri has eight congressional districts, with six currently represented by Republicans. 
The 5th District, based in Kansas City and represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005, is carved up under the new map with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
The intended result is a map where Republicans hold seven of the state’s eight seats. 
Revising congressional district lines occurs every 10 years, after the allocation of seats following the federal census. The Missouri Constitution mandates it but is silent on whether lawmakers have the power to do so at other times, and the lawsuits challenging the map point to the lack of any mention of mid-decade redistricting as evidence that it is not permitted. 
Republican lawmakers dismissed these arguments as they were approving the maps, saying this type of interpretation of the constitution would leave lawmakers unable to make any adjustments in between censuses, even if ordered by a court.
The last time lines were redrawn between censuses in Missouri was in the 1960s, following the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision that districts had to be drawn as closely as possible in population to preserve equal representation, known as the one person, one vote decision.
 Referendum

A group called People NOT Politicians Missouri attempted to file a citizen referendum on Friday shortly after the new map cleared the state Senate. The goal is to put the map on the 2026 ballot for voters to decide whether or not to implement it. 
But the group’s attempt to get its campaign started — they must collect 100,000 signatures in 90 days to put the map on the November 2026 ballot — ran into an administrative hurdle when the secretary of state’s office refused to certify it until the governor signs the bill into law. 
Kehoe has 45 days to sign the bill. 
Over the weekend, however, the secretary of state’s office slightly backtracked, sending a letter to People NOT Politicians Missouri explaining that it would begin the process of certifying the referendum petition sample sheet that would be used to gather signatures. 
The office has sent a copy to the Missouri Attorney General’s Office for legal review and the State Auditor for preparation of a cost estimate. 
“Only after the Attorney General has rendered an opinion on legal sufficiency and the secretary of state has reviewed those comments can this office make a final determination regarding the approval or rejection of the form of the petition,” the letter states. 
The secretary of state, the letter added, “has not yet made a final determination whether your referendum petition may be accepted for processing or circulation.”
Protesters gather in the Missouri Capitol rotunda in opposition to a proposed congressional district map that passed the House (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
In 2019, the secretary of state’s office used procedural maneuvers to derail a referendum campaign that sought to overturn newly-passed restrictions on abortion. The move sparked a lawsuit, and in 2022 the Missouri Supreme Court ruled the laws the secretary of state used to obstruct the citizen-initiated referendum process were unconstitutional.
A spokeswoman for Secretary of State Denny Hoskins agreed on Friday that the 2022 court ruling means signatures can be counted as valid even if they are collected prior to the certification of a ballot title, “since otherwise the full process could eat up over half of their available gathering time.”
On Saturday, the political action committee supporting the referendum received a $500,000 check from Global Impact Social Welfare Fund, a 501c4 nonprofit that is not required to disclose its donors. 
Based in Washington, D.C., Global Impact Social Welfare Fund is a liberal advocacy organization that has spent millions in support of ballot initiatives across the country. Last year, the group donated more than $1 million to the successful campaign to enshrine abortion rights in Missouri’s constitution. 
In addition to the gerrymandered congressional map, Republican lawmakers also approved a proposal to require any changes to the state constitution through the initiative petition process to be approved by a majority of voters statewide and in each of the state’s eight congressional districts. 
Based on last year’s election results, that change would mean as few as 5% of voters could defeat any ballot measure. The new requirements would only apply to citizen-led initiative petitions, not amendments placed on the ballot by the legislature.
GOP lawmakers pointed specifically at last year’s abortion amendment — and the campaign contributions of out-of-state advocacy organizations like Global  Impact Social Welfare Fund — to justify the change. 
A referendum was last deployed in Missouri seven years ago, when labor unions collected 300,000 signatures in 90 days — more than three times the amount required — to put a question on the statewide ballot repealing a GOP-backed right-to-work law.
The repeal push was ultimately successful, with 67% of voters rejecting the right-to-work law. In fact, of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice.
The AFL-CIO, which led the 2018 referendum campaign, has indicated it will support the push to put the congressional map on the ballot next year. Over the weekend, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union donated $50,000 to People NOT Politicians Missouri for the campaign. 
Elsa Rainey, a spokeswoman for People NOT Politicians Missouri, called Missouri’s new map “an unconstitutional power grab” and a “blatant attempt to rig the 2026 elections before a single vote is cast.”
“It violates Missouri law,” she said, “slices apart communities and strikes at the core of our democratic system.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally2-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-15 09:56:13.809369

Such efforts have recently drawn interest from a politically-diverse group of figures such as Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont as well as Republican President Donald J. Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, all of whom view natural gas as a way of reducing the region’s cost-of-energy burden.
Opponents, meanwhile, argue that building a new pipeline will only worsen pollution and the release of climate-altering greenhouse gases, while doing little to bring down prices.
 What is the Constitution Pipeline?

The Constitution Pipeline is being developed by Williams Companies, a large operator of pipelines across the United States. The pipeline would have the ability to carry up to 650 million cubic feet of gas a day, according to the company, enough to serve about 3 million homes.
Williams first received federal approvals to build the pipeline more than a decade ago, but the project hit a snag when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation declined to issue a water quality permit in 2016.
The project continued to languish until the developers resubmitted applications to state and federal regulators earlier this year.
“Williams remains committed to advancing the Constitution Pipeline project and has submitted permit applications,” to regulators in New York and Pennsylvania, the company said in a statement this month. “We are also continuing to work with the states, Congress, and the Administration to strengthen U.S. energy markets, lower costs for American families, and support long-term economic growth.”
Pending those approvals, Williams estimates that the pipeline should begin construction next year and enter service near the end of 2027.
 Is Connecticut involved?

While the Constitution Pipeline itself will not carry gas into Connecticut, its terminus in New York will link up with two existing pipelines — the Tennessee and Iroquois systems — that serve both the state and the wider region.
Those pipelines already operate at or near capacity, officials say, creating a supply bottleneck particularly during winter months when gas is used to both heat homes and fuel the power plants that produce the bulk of the region’s electricity.
In order to reduce that bottleneck, pipeline operators in Connecticut are pursuing their own expansion projects.
Iroquois pipeline’s owners, for example, are seeking to build a series of compressors that would push an additional 125 million cubic feet of gas through the each day, an increase of 8.3% over its existing capacity. Meanwhile, Canadian energy company Enbridge has its own plans to expand its regional pipeline, the Algonquin, by 2029.
Carolina Kulbeth, a spokesperson for Tennessee Pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, said in a statement that expanding pipeline capacity is “critical” to eliminating existing constraints on gas supply.
“New pipeline infrastructure is the only way to ensure reliability and affordability in the New England region, as demand continues to rise among residential, commercial, and industrial customers,” Kulbeth said.
Trump himself has touted the pipeline’s benefits, saying that it would lower energy prices by up to $5,000 per family in the Northeast — figures that critics say are wildly inflated.
“I can tell you Connecticut wants it and all of New England wants it,” Trump said in March. “And who wouldn’t it?”
 What does it have to do with wind?

In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that the resurrection of the Constitution Pipeline was linked to negotiations between the Trump administration and New York over the fate of another project, Empire Wind.
Federal authorities had pulled permits for the wind project in April, only to reverse course around the same time that Williams resubmitted its pipeline applications.
While New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has denied making any explicit promises to approve the pipeline, she has expressed a willingness to work with the administration and developers on unnamed “new energy projects” that comply with state law.
Lamont, however, has strongly suggested that the two projects are intertwined.
After the Trump administration last week ordered a halt in construction on another wind project being staged in New London, Lamont expressed surprise at the decision given his prior support for the development of new pipelines.
“We’re already having very productive conversations with Williams pipeline company and [the secretaries] of Energy and Interior regarding how we can get additional sources of power here to this region, including American natural gas,” Lamont said. “So I don’t think there’s a conflict there.”
 What do opponents say?

Critics of pipeline expansion argue that projects such as Constitution are at odds with the commitments made by local elected officials to slowly wean the region off of its reliance on fossil fuels. Connecticut, for example, has laws pledging to get all of the state’s power needs from carbon-free sources no later than 2040 and achieving economy-wide net-zero emissions 10 years after that.
In addition, they point to the region’s already sky-high energy prices to argue that importing more natural gas is not an effective solution.
“This is not about what’s better for the climate, or air or energy costs,” said Samantha Dynowski, the Connecticut state director for the Sierra Club. “This is about, you know, Trump’s buddies, his fossil fuel buddies.”
During his presidential campaign last year, Trump pledged to ease environmental restrictions and approve new drilling, pipeline and other fossil fuel projects. At the same time, he attempted to solicit $1 billion in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry.
Pipeline projects such as the Iroquois and Algonquin expansion projects have also faced local opposition in Connecticut, particularly in Brookfield where residents have complained about plans to build a new compressor station in close proximity to a middle school.
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced its tentative approval of the compressor on July 31.

Beginning Dec. 4, 2025, residents can use a Transfer on Death (TOD) deed to leave real estate directly to chosen beneficiaries—without the delays, expense, or uncertainty of probate.
“This is a major victory for Delaware families,” said Mike Kozikowski, New Castle County Recorder of Deeds. “With the new Transfer on Death Act, you can designate a beneficiary for your home or other real estate, and when you pass, that property goes directly to them without having to go through probate. That means no waiting, no legal fees, and no question about who owns the property.”
Kozikowski highlighted the breakthrough as a featured guest on “A Better Discussion,” a weekly webcast of A Better Delaware hosted by former state attorney general M. Jane Brady. “We are now the 34th state to have this option,” he said. “It’s a simple document that can spare loved ones months or even years of legal headaches.”
How TOD Works
The law—House Bill 147, Substitute 1—creates a legal document called a Transfer on Death deed. Homeowners can record a TOD deed naming one or more beneficiaries. Upon the owner’s death, title to the property automatically transfers to those beneficiaries, bypassing probate altogether.
“You still control your property,” Kozikowski explained. “You can sell it, refinance it, even revoke the TOD deed at any time. The beneficiary has no rights until you pass. It’s revocable, it’s flexible, and it protects your loved ones.”
To be valid, the deed must:


Name the beneficiary or beneficiaries.


State that the transfer takes effect at the owner’s death.


Be signed before two independent witnesses who are not beneficiaries.


Be notarized and recorded with the Recorder of Deeds before the owner dies.


A Lifeline for Families Without Wills
Kozikowski said the new law is especially valuable for families who do not have a will. “When the AARP did their study, they found that a large segment of Black, Hispanic and low-income white homeowners never filed a will,” he said. “This law helps those families keep their property intact and out of a lengthy probate proceeding. Instead of getting only a percentage of what’s left after probate, the beneficiary receives the full property right away.”
Timing and Cautions
Although the bill was signed by Gov. John Carney on Sept. 5, it includes a 90-day implementation period, making Dec. 4 the first day TOD deeds can be recorded. “If someone is terminally ill and wants to act right away, I recommend they meet with an attorney and prepare a will,” Kozikowski advised. “A TOD deed filed before that date will not be valid if the person passes before December 4.”
He also noted that a TOD deed will override any conflicting instructions in a will once it is in effect. “The Transfer on Death deed supersedes a will because it takes effect immediately upon death,” Kozikowski said.
Part of a Broader Modernization
The TOD legislation caps more than two decades of modernization under Kozikowski. Since taking office in 2002, he has expanded electronic recording—now used for about 70 percent of documents—added online access to deeds and mortgages, and created educational videos explaining the recording process.
“Our job is to receive, record, process and deliver documents that protect property rights,” he said. “Whether it’s new technology or new legislation, everything we do is about customer service and making life easier for the public.”

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
The divisions in American politics are usually obvious, often nowhere more than in the House of Representatives. But there are also glimmers of bipartisanship, and, lately, many of those have been driven by women.
At the start of this year, Reps. Brittany Pettersen, a Democrat, and Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican, united forces to challenge House leadership with a push to make the House friendlier for new mothers. In the past few weeks, three of the most outspoken House Republican women broke ranks with their party — and bucked President Donald Trump — in an effort to release more files related to the case of the late disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
And this week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Republican Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida and Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California came together on a House resolution calling for expanded early screening for Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS), a blood-clotting disorder that can cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant people.
They credited their cooperation to singer Christina Perri, who learned she had APS after losing her daughter Rosie late in pregnancy in 2020. Perri is now channeling her grief into advocacy. She said in an interview that it was “a privilege” to see lawmakers like Kamlager-Dove and Cammack putting their party affiliations to the side and uniting on an issue so important to her.
“What matters is that we’re women, we’re moms, we just want other women and moms to be okay,” she said. “And I find that really inspiring at a time where everything is just so messy, and I feel grateful to be a part of something like this.”
Women make up half of the U.S. population but hold just 28 percent of seats in Congress. Research has not backed up the notion that women lawmakers are, overall, more bipartisan than men at the federal level. But select instances so far in this Congress show how unlikely coalitions of women lawmakers have united across party lines, challenged party leadership or both.
A major news conference at the Capitol with Epstein survivors last week yielded what four years ago would have been an all but unthinkable scene: Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a progressive Democrat, defending and embracing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a conservative firebrand and staunch Trump ally.
“She has shown so much courage on this issue, so much leadership,” Khanna said of Greene, who was met with an uneven reception by the crowd. “I saw some people, when I was coming here, calling her names. We’ve got to stop that. We’ve got to stop the partisanship on this issue.”
Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are attempting to force a House floor vote on the Epstein files resolution with a procedural measure known as a discharge petition, which enables members to circumvent House leadership to get a measure to the floor. Every sitting House Democrat and just three Republicans other than Massie — Greene, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina — have signed the discharge petition, leaving it just one signature short of the 218 required to force a vote.










Never underestimate a woman. We all came here to do work. We all made promises, and some of us live up to them.


All three women have maintained their support for the measure despite fierce opposition from Trump and the White House. At the news conference, Massie called Greene “the bravest woman in Congress.” He also posed the question: “Where are the men?”
“Never underestimate a woman,” Boebert said at the Capitol on Tuesday. “We all came here to do work. We all made promises, and some of us live up to them.”
Shared experiences around pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood have united some House members to work across the aisle.
“I think I can say very candidly now, as a new mom, moms just know how to multitask and learn how to get things done,” said Cammack, who welcomed her daughter Auggie last month. “And that might be why you see more bipartisan efforts coming out of the women, even though we represent a minority in Congress.”
At Tuesday’s news conference, Kamlager-Dove, Cammack and Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio all spoke about their experiences with pregnancy losses while building their families.
“What unites us is far deeper than what may appear on the surface,” Kamlager-Dove said. “Many of us share journeys to parenthood that are marked by hope, loss and eventually, resilience.”
Luna, the Florida Republican, and Pettersen, the Colorado Democrat, are also among the handful of House members to give birth while in office — and both missed votes after giving birth. They teamed up on a measure to allow new parents in the House to temporarily designate another member to vote for them, also known as proxy voting. House Speaker Mike Johnson vigorously opposed the effort, leading the duo to turn to a discharge petition. They succeeded in getting 218 votes on their discharge petition and overcame Johnson’s effort to quash the measure on the floor, temporarily grinding House business to a halt. Luna later struck a deal with Johnson, standing down on the proxy voting push in exchange for other concessions (Pettersen and other Democrats criticized the deal as insufficient).
Now, Luna is a member of another bipartisan coalition, this one backing a proposed ban on stock trading for members of Congress. Another member of the group, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a progressive Democrat, said at a September 3 news conference that, unlike in other legislative negotiations, lawmakers turned around a better product than the one they started with.
“It is one of those rare moments where I feel like Washington is working the way it’s supposed to work,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And it feels foreign. And it feels alien … but I also think it is proof that things can work here.”
Women lawmakers “are better communicators,” Luna told The 19th while leaving House votes on Tuesday. At the September 3 stock trading ban news conference, she indicated she’s prepared to challenge House leadership again if necessary.
“I often feel like an adjudicator in this job,” she said. “And so I guess I’ll be the one to say that we’ve asked nicely for leadership to put this on the floor. If they don’t, I say timeline is end of month: There’s a discharge petition that is ready to go.”










It is one of those rare moments where I feel like Washington is working the way it’s supposed to work.


The most consequential legislation passed by Congress this year has been muscled through without Democratic support, and there have been plenty of moments of acrimony on the floor.
Much of it has been clearly gendered: On Wednesday, as the House considered its annual defense spending bill, Mace erupted at Rep. Sara Jacobs, a California Democrat, during debate over Mace’s proposed anti-transgender amendments to the legislation. Rep. Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat who this year became the first openly transgender lawmaker to serve in Congress, has faced repeated attacks and misgendering from some of her Republican colleagues.
High-profile but not expressly political public figures have, in many cases, been the catalysts for bipartisan congressional action.
Years of tireless lobbying by Paris Hilton led to Congress passing a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing child abuse and neglect in youth residential facilities last December. Engineer, author and science TV host Emily Calandrelli’s personal story of being hassled by TSA as a new parent led to the Senate and a House committee passing bipartisan legislation making it easier for parents to travel with breast milk and breastfeeding equipment through airport security. The legislation has not received a vote on the House floor.
And Epstein’s survivors, Khanna said, are “helping us come together as a country.”
“I’ve never done a press conference with Marjorie Taylor Greene before,” he joked at the September 3 news conference.
Both Cammack and Kamlager-Dove credited Perri with using her platform to raise awareness about APS — and bringing them together on a mission to promote the adoption of what they said is a simple test that could spare so many the heartache of pregnancy loss.
“We bonded over a common story of having a miscarriage and wanting answers to questions that were not easy to come by,” Kamlager-Dove said.
“Without her advocacy, without her courage to come forward, this wouldn’t be happening, and so she has been the driver in really bringing us together to make this a reality,” Cammack said.
Cammack said she’s “very confident” about the resolution on APS testing moving forward and getting a vote on the House floor. Perri said the measure’s passing would be “a win for everybody,” and a victory “that feels kind of rare right now.”
“My hope and goal is to have this changed forever, for women to not need to even know about it,” she said. “But until then, I will always speak about it, and I will help move the needle forward.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/uscapitolmiranda_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-15 09:56:13.809369

The California Legislature’s long, busy and contentious session drew to a close this weekend. Here’s what you need to know: 

Lawmakers delivered Gov. Gavin Newsom one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades. The six-bill package that passed over the weekend was framed as a way to ease gas and electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs. “Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills,” Alejandro Lazo and Jeanne Kuang report. 


Lawmakers paved the way for a building boom near transit stations in many of the state’s most populous areas. The new bill overrides local development decisions, allowing apartment developers to construct residential buildings as tall as 75 feet regardless of local zoning maps or outcry. “In a legislative year teeming with controversial housing bills designed to kick-start more construction in California,” Ben Christopher writes, this new bill “has been among the most controversial.” Like the energy package, Newsom is expected to sign the legislation into law.


The effort to regulate when AI makes consequential decisions about your life will have to wait yet another year. The three-year-old campaign would have required businesses and government agencies to tell you when AI is used to make important decisions about you, such as housing approvals, school admissions, hiring and firing and a host of other decision on things like health, criminal justice, government benefits and others. Khari Johnson reports that while California has passed more AI regulation than any other state, the European Union and Colorado have already passed these kinds of disclosure laws. 

The Legislature is now out of session until January.

Some 75,000 homes remain standing where the Eaton and Palisades fires left so much destruction. While they appear safe, they are embedded with toxic residue that can make you seriously sick, writes Nicole Kolinsky, the executive director of the Coalition for Insurance Accountability. Yet insurers are telling families it is safe to reinhabit the homes, she says.

This year’s theme, “Somos América – We Are America,” celebrated cultural heritage and civic unity while highlighting the growing influence of Delaware’s Hispanic community. Organized by Nuestras Raíces Inc., the parade followed a lively route through the city’s Westside neighborhood, beginning near Lincoln Street and Fourth Street, proceeding along Fourth Street (Calle Cuatro) and surrounding blocks, and finishing at the festival grounds on Fourth Street. The procession stretched for more than two hours, making it one of the longest-running and most vibrant events in the state.
Parade Highlights
The colorful march featured school marching bands, folkloric dance groups, decorated floats and performances by salsa, merengue and bachata musicians. Honorees included Grand Marshal Rony Baltazar-Lopez, Madrina Denise Rodriguez and Padrino Wilfredo Crespo.
Baltazar-Lopez, appointed to the Delaware Hispanic Commission by Gov. John Carney in 2020 and elected vice chair in 2021, was recognized for his leadership and advocacy on behalf of Hispanic representation and civic engagement. “His selection reflects a commitment to uplifting Hispanic voices and bridging gaps in access to resources,” organizers said.
More Than a Celebration
Beyond music and dance, the parade served as Delaware’s largest one-day outreach event for Hispanic and multicultural communities. Calle 4 offered free cancer screening enrollment, mental health services, opioid recovery support and immigration assistance. Mobile clinics and community booths targeted underserved Black and brown neighborhoods with critical health resources.
Community Voices
Parade organizer Will Resto said the event “brings the community together” and remains “a tradition to celebrate family, heritage and being part of a great community.”

Mike Rozikowski, New Castle County recorder of deeds, called the celebration “a link to the past and a celebration of the future of the Hispanic community as a critical part of the future of our community in New Castle County.”
A participant noted that the parade has become a family reunion of sorts. “Family members who now live in Philly, New York, Lancaster come back to participate every year,” she said.
Looking Ahead
This year’s festival also launched a year-long campaign leading to the parade’s 50th anniversary in 2026, which will align with Delaware’s DE250 observance of America’s 250th birthday.

Insurers don’t want to cover this.","Guest Commentary written by

Nicole Kolinsky
Nicole Kolinsky is the executive director of the Coalition for Insurance Accountability.


A few days after the September 11 attacks, the Environmental Protection Agency assured New Yorkers the air near Ground Zero was safe to breathe. Tragically, that wasn’t true. 
In the 24 years since, studies have linked toxic exposure in Manhattan to soaring cancer rates among first responders, residents, office workers and students. Thousands have died and thousands more are sick. The federal victim compensation fund has paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,000 people. 
Today Californians face a similar public health crisis — only this time, it’s unfolding across wildfire-scarred communities. And insurers are making matters worse. 
The recent Eaton and Palisades fires destroyed, damaged or rendered inaccessible about 15,000 homes.  Some 75,000 remain standing in the two fire perimeters, and many appear safe and intact. 
But environmental hygienists say these homes in the fire zone that escaped total loss are nevertheless embedded with toxic residue, including cyanide and asbestos, as well as heavy metals such as manganese, lithium, beryllium, lead, arsenic, cobalt and volatile organic compounds. 
Like the toxic soup at Ground Zero, these compounds are exceedingly dangerous, especially in combination. They can lodge deep in the lungs, enter the bloodstream and cause cancers, strokes and long-term neurological disease. 
In many homes, these toxins have penetrated walls, furniture, heating and air conditioner systems in ways that cannot be fully eradicated. Those houses will need to be stripped to the studs or demolished.
Yet insurers are telling families it is safe to reinhabit the homes — according to testing thresholds set by their own contracted vendors. Their version of “safe,” like the EPA’s after 9/11, doesn’t match the science, nor does it safeguard people on the ground. 
The newly formed Coalition for Insurance Accountability seeks to hold these insurers to account, shine a light on these invisible dangers and push regulators to adopt higher, science-backed safety standards.
Why is there such a disconnect between the dangerous environmental realities and what insurance companies are willing to test and cover? The answer is profit. 
After California’s record-breaking wildfires in 2017 and 2018, many insurers quietly rewrote policies to exclude or severely limit coverage for fire-prone areas. After the most recent fires, insurers often refused to cover testing for asbestos, lead and heavy metals, unless there was visible physical damage. 
Even the FAIR Plan, California’s insurer of last resort, tried protecting its assets by rejecting lab-based testing. A recent court ruling found FAIR Plan has unlawfully denied claims for damages that were not visible or detectable by smell. 
This narrow definition of damage is a common industry tactic. Insurers avoid paying for the comprehensive testing and remediation that science says is necessary. They are redefining risk, rather than acknowledging the true scope of the contamination and long-term health consequences. 
As Californians face this invisible crisis, the state must work to close the gap between what insurers claim is safe and what science proves is safe for the families who want to return home. This isn’t a call for panic; it’s a call for accountability and decisive action.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/011225-Eaton-Fire-Clean-Up-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-15 08:56:48.222373

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)The week of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a Turning Point USA speaking event at Utah Valley University, a coalition of Utah organizations of different political affiliations appeared side by side to launch Turn Toward Each Other, a toolkit to reduce polarization in communities.
The organizations hope the effort shows the state’s commitment to meet the moment “not with division, but with a promise to build peace together,” Marianne Viray, executive director of the Disagree Better nonprofit, said in a statement. 
“Now is the moment to choose to turn toward each other, for us to come together as a community, a collective pause to help us align our responses to the tragedy,” Viray said during a news conference at the Utah State Capitol on Friday.

The website features a collection of tried resources to have more productive conversations, including a list of “dos and don’ts for communicating in response to violence,” and workshops on how to interact constructively on social media.
“There are courses you can take in how to navigate major conflict, suggestions on how to talk about gun violence with your children, and the list goes on,” she said. “They may not seem like big actions some people are calling for at a time like this, but there are many small things we can each do to turn toward each other more in conversation, in relationship and community.”
Participating organizations include Better Angels, Disagree Better, Living Room Conversations, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, Waymakers, Wheatley Institute, and The Dignity Institute.
Among the people at the Utah Capitol were Zac Wilson and Jack Davis, who attended Brigham Young University at about the same time but ended up in opposite political spaces on the Utah County campus. Wilson went on to chair the Utah Young Republicans for a time, while Davis led the Young Democrats of Utah.

“It’s sad when a tragedy is the catalyst for people coming together and talking through some of these things, but I hope this is a wake-up call,” Wilson said on Friday. “We can root out some of the ideology and the rhetoric and tone that went into what happened two days ago.”
For Davis, the moment was also a reflection of what happens when people get off social media and talk to their neighbors and community members.
“Zac and I would probably have a different relationship if we only communicated on social media,” Davis said. “And I think that this is a time for people to think about what it means to actually have relationships with the people around them.”
Wilson praised Kirk’s debates that, while at times confrontational, he said allowed everyone to have a voice. As a direct result of Kirk’s effort, Wilson said, Gen Z was brought into political processes and standing for freedom of speech. 
“In the coming weeks and months. We need to move beyond the platitudes and figure out what’s going on. What’s the root cause of what killed Charlie. Our country is an inspiring and beautiful place, one that has survived a civil war, one that, in the 1960s, survived rioting, unrest and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy,” Wilson said. “We can and we will overcome this.”
‘Our nation is broken,’ Utah Gov. Cox says of Charlie Kirk assassination

While Davis may disagree with Wilson most of the time, he said he couldn’t be in a greater agreement at this moment, since everyone in the country has the promise of freedom of speech. 
“The brutal attack that we witnessed this week wasn’t just an attack on a man and a family, though it was,” Davis said. “It was also an attack on that fundamental right of free speech that we enjoy and that lets each of us engage in our communities in the way that we wish.”
Davis also urged all young Utahns to reject violence as a means to try to accomplish something.
“Political violence is a corrosive evil that we cannot allow in our state. It cannot take root here, because that is the destruction of the political system that we know and love,” Davis said.
Now, the two men have plans to meet and discuss how to go from here and turn the idea of encouraging young people to engage in political processes amid turmoil into action.
On Friday the Utah Department of Health and Human Services also reminded that Utahns feeling scared, anxious, or overwhelmed due to traumatic events like this can call or text 988, which will connect them with a crisis worker at the Utah Crisis Line 24/7 for free.
“They can help work through your feelings and make appropriate connections to other mental health resources across the state. Our team is here around the clock to support Utahns in need,” Rachel Lucynski, director of Community Crisis Intervention and Support Services at Huntsman Mental Health Institute said in a statement.

But local health departments have closed clinics, stopped programs, cut immunization appointments, and laid off workers anyway.","In summary
Whether federal cuts are legal is still undecided. But local health departments have closed clinics, stopped programs, cut immunization appointments, and laid off workers anyway.


Earlier this year, Selena Peña spent her days helping Kern County residents learn how to lead healthier lives through nutrition and fitness classes. She was part of a public health team focused on reducing high rates of obesity and heart disease. 
But in July the county eliminated the program, citing the loss of $12.5 million in federal public health funding. It was early in a series of cascading cuts to Kern’s health programs this year. Other counties are making similar decisions.
Across the state, county health and human services departments have made significant reductions to bread-and-butter programs as a result of the Trump administration’s funding cuts and freezes. Kern, San Luis Obispo, Orange and Los Angeles counties, as well as the city of Long Beach, are among those reducing health services. The state’s budgetary crisis and subsequent public health cuts have also strained local resources.
California cities and counties have closed public health clinics, eliminated family planning programs, stopped dental services, reduced appointment availability for immunizations, instituted hiring freezes and laid off dozens of local health workers. At the end of the month, because of cuts in Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, most county health departments will shut down nutrition programs focused on teaching low-income families how to stretch their food stamp dollars and cook healthier food.
Kern has the highest rate of diabetes-related deaths in the state, and 78% of adults are overweight or obese, according to state data. Peña, who was born and raised there, has seen firsthand how poverty, lack of education and language barriers contribute to poor health. That’s why she was thrilled to do work that helped people like her mom begin to take control of their health. 
The irony is not lost on local health leaders that while U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vocally pushes an agenda targeting leading causes of chronic disease like obesity and heart disease, local programs to address these issues and more have been gutted. His recent “Make Our Children Healthy Again” strategy report called out poor diet and lack of physical activity as primary drivers of chronic disease among kids.
“It’s not good enough to say this is important,” said Bernadette Boden-Albala, dean of the school of population and public health at UC Irvine. “They talk about nutrition, but where’s the money on nutrition?
Health departments are well-positioned to improve community health outcomes, Boden-Albala said, because their services are often aimed at improving systemic barriers that make it harder for people to be healthy. They focus on food insecurity, health education and access, disease prevention and surveillance, mental health and regulations to promote safety.
The work is preventative in nature, and without it communities will have more illness, higher costs and fewer health care options, said Long Beach Health and Human Services Director Alison King.
“When public health funding is reduced, prevention work is often the first to be impacted,” King said.
Long Beach has lost nearly $4 million in federal grants with the largest cut affecting its HIV and sexually transmitted infection prevention program.
These policies “will reverberate for the rest of this administration if not well beyond that,” said Arthur Reingold, professor of epidemiology at UC Berkeley School of Public Health and global infectious disease expert.
DOGE cuts billions of public health dollars 
Many of the cuts to local health departments started in March when Elon Musk, then-adviser to the Department of Government Efficiency, terminated more than $11 billion of public health funding nationwide. California lost nearly $1 billion.
Those cuts targeted money that health departments had used to bolster their response to the COVID-19 pandemic by shoring up laboratory capacity, community outreach and immunization programs. In turn, many counties hired dozens of public health workers and were able to expand other services. 
The grants were, in some cases, scheduled to last until 2027. Their abrupt termination left counties scrambling.
“We couldn’t even prepare for the end of this funding. That was what was so catastrophic for us,” said Brynn Carrigan, Kern County public health director. “We received notification the day after the stop-funding order was effective.”
California sued to prevent the Trump administration’s cuts, and a federal judge ruled in May that the money must be restored while the lawsuit plays out. But in many ways, the tug of war between federal cuts and state litigation still left local governments with no choice but to eliminate services. If the courts were to ultimately side with the Trump administration, counties would have to repay the money to the federal government.

“At the end of the day all of the liability and all of the risk is on the county, and we’re talking millions of dollars,” Carrigan said.
That’s why programs like Peña’s healthy habits team and others have been terminated.
Her team — called “Know Your Numbers” — checked residents’ blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol and body mass index before providing seven weeks of free dietary and exercise classes to show them how their numbers improved.
“Our health should be a priority. We should want to combat the things that make us unhealthy: Diseases, tobacco, unhealthy foods,” said Peña, a member of Service Employees International Union Local 721. “It’s discouraging when the government doesn’t want to care for the health of the public.”
California counties eliminate dental, other programs
In Kern County, the department has also been forced to close a clinic serving rural farm communities, stop most mobile clinic services, reduce appointment availability at its primary Bakersfield clinic by 67%, and eliminate 35 jobs.
More than 170 miles south, Orange County Health Director Veronica Kelley has grappled with the same difficult decisions. Public health has “not been whole for decades,” Kelly said, but the early federal grant terminations have been especially harsh. They cost Orange County $13.7 million over the next two years.
In May, the county closed its emergency dental clinic. A month later, the children’s clinic and family planning clinic also closed. A federal program to help new moms with diapers, breastfeeding support and food has also been reduced. In October, the county will lose an additional $4 million to combat obesity and food insecurity.
“If we do care about the health of Americans and people who live here and the health of Orange County residents, then we need to put more focus on funding these services,” Kelley said. 
The department tried to make reductions in areas where other community providers could absorb the patient load and have the least impact on access to services, Kelley said. But the county isn’t blind to the probability that more cuts will happen in the coming years, as federal support for Medicaid decreases substantially.
Most counties rely on Medicaid to provide mental health services and inpatient substance abuse treatment. It also helps pay for public health clinics where people can get immunizations and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections. Counties that run public hospitals are facing even greater uncertainty.
Los Angeles public hospitals brace for Medicaid cuts
In Los Angeles County, the health services department projects it will have a $1.85 billion annual deficit by 2028-29 largely due to Medicaid cuts. The department operates four public hospitals, and 80% of its patients rely on Medicaid for health insurance. 
At a recent county supervisors meeting, county Chief Executive Fesia Davenport said federal cuts will likely result in thousands of layoffs and could precipitate the closure of a county hospital. 
There are no current plans to close any hospitals, said Jorge Orozco, chief executive of L.A. General Medical Center, but the department has instituted a hiring freeze. County officials are also considering consolidating services that might be provided at multiple hospitals like radiation oncology and delaying maintenance and capital improvement projects.
Still, a deficit of that magnitude will be impossible for the county to fully absorb.
“Belt tightening efforts and cost efficiencies really are not sufficient to make up $1.85 billion,” Orozco said. “That’s really catastrophic.”
The L.A. County Department of Public Health earlier this year also lost $45 million in federal grants and has instituted a hiring freeze.
Orozco said cuts to the health care safety net will ultimately impact everyone in L.A. County. One-third of all trauma cases are taken to a county hospital, he added. 
“Our safety net system really serves a huge segment of our population here at L.A. General,” Orozco said. “So the impact of service reductions, the impact of budget reductions, will be felt not only to the most vulnerable, but really all of our community.”

The program, called Pathways to Success, aims to bolster the state’s economy through offering support for ongoing education.
“For us, it’s about providing support for them growing their human capital for what is needed in that region,” ACHE Executive Director Jim Purcell said. “We basically did a statistical analysis using the American Community Survey (ACS) and determined two workforce regions that were on the cusp of economic growth but they needed to have a different mix of credentialed individuals.”

The ACS is an annual survey of social and economic demographics conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Students attending a four-year institution can receive up to $3,000 per academic year for full-time enrollment and $250 per credit hour for part-time enrollment. Students attending a two-year institution can receive up to $1,500 per academic year for full-time enrollment and $125 per credit hour for part-time enrollment.
The initiative currently focuses on the southeast, east and north Alabama regions. According to a presentation, the Southeastern region has a high number of people with associate degrees, but is in need of individuals with a bachelor degree or higher and higher labor force participation.
Jacksonville State University (JSU), Troy University, Athens State University and Calhoun Community College will participate in the program.
JSU’s tuition this academic year is $10,590 while Troy’s tuition is $10,176. Athens State University’s tuition for last academic year was $6,120 and Calhoun Community College’s tuition for the same term was $5,120.
“Being selected for the Pathways to Progress Initiative affirms our commitment to helping northeast Alabama grow by building a stronger workforce and creating more opportunities for adult learners,” JSU President Don C. Killingsworh said in a statement.
Purcell said the program will move across the state as the ACS is updated.
“We will be looking at places which we think we can increase the speed we rightset the workforce there to provide an appropriate mix of bachelors and associates in a community,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/College-graduates-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 08:56:48.222373

Residents and churches have filed a lawsuit to stop the ongoing mining at the site, saying it is having a negative impact on the community. (Southern Environmental Law Center)Cody Gilliam said the tranquility of life in Belle Mina in Limestone County is now punctuated by blasts from dynamite.
“They have seen their lives upended because of the blasting so far,” said Gilliam, pastor for Belle Mina Methodist Church and a resident of the area. “They have felt it. They have pictures moving on the walls. They have actually had some of their china break in their cabinets.”
Gilliam’s church, one of the plaintiffs listed in the case, along with other Belle Mina residents and churches, filed suit earlier this year against Stoned LLC, a company operating a nearby quarry and conducting the blasting.

“These residents are experiencing the horrific effects of the quarry,” said Sarah Stokes, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, who is representing residents and area churches that include Bella Mina Methodist. “They can’t sleep at night, their children can’t sleep at night, they can’t sit outside their house and enjoy being outside on their property because the dust is too thick.”
Attorneys representing Stoned LLC, along with Grayson Carter & Son Contracting, Inc., Elephants R Us LLC; Landquest Properties, LLC, the defendants in the lawsuit, declined comment. In legal filings, the companies denied many of the claims in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleges that the operator of the quarry plans to harvest roughly 400 tons of limestone at the site, equivalent to about one million tons of the sediment annually, which will continue for the next 30 years.
According to the lawsuit, operators detonate explosives to fracture the limestone so that it can be extracted, causing several problems for local residents.
“Defendants have blasted at the Quarry Site at least eight times since they began construction in November 2024,” the lawsuit states. “Blasting creates noise, dust, vibrations that can damage structures, as well as cause flyrock that can travel beyond the boundaries of the Quarry Site.”
Aside from the noise that stems from the explosives, residents near the site must also endure the sound generated by the equipment that grinds the limestone 11 hours per day more than five days per week, the lawsuit said. That is in addition to the noise generated by vehicle traffic from operating the quarry.
“Air pollutants and emissions will adversely affect the individual Plaintiffs’ and the church congregants if they gather outdoors at their churches: inhalation of such pollutants can trigger allergic reactions, and/or cause symptoms like sneezing, itching, skin rashes, and respiratory distress,” the lawsuit states.
Residents also worry that the quarry will alter the environment. According to the lawsuit, the quarry could disrupt the flow of groundwater and affect a local creek. Residents also said in the lawsuit that disrupting the flow of groundwater could damage their structures.
“In some instances, ground subsidence results in open sinkholes that swallow anything on the surface. Mapping of the Belle Mina area shows multiple sinkholes and subsidence features surrounding the Quarry Site,” the lawsuit states.
Gilliam said he understands that limestone needs to be harvested and has its uses but expressed concerns that the site operators selected was near a residential community.
“The issue that I have, in a 20-mile radius there are five quarries,” Gilliam said.
The plaintiffs are seeking to have the quarry closed by having the court issue a permanent injunction to prevent the company from operating the quarry.

(Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Air conditioning is a life-saving tool in southern Nevada, but more and more people are finding it difficult to afford.  
Jacqueline Banderas, a mother of five, said there are times she’s received electricity bills of more than $1,000 to cool her home at the height of summer. 
“Once, they even cut my power because I was just one dollar short on a payment. My food spoiled, and the heat was unbearable,” said Banderas, a musician in Las Dos de Sinaloa Band. “My son has asthma and depends on a nebulizer. I live in constant fear that one day I won’t be able to afford the bill, and his health will be at risk.”
She is one of nearly 32,000 Nevadans who had their power disconnected by NV Energy for nonpayment in 2024, according to the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada. Year-by-year the number of disconnections for nonpayment has increased as the cost of utilities have gone up, in large part as a result of extreme weather. 
NV Energy is prohibited from cutting off power to delinquent residential customers when the temperature is forecast to exceed 105, but any lower and it’s free game. And once power is cut, NV Energy is not required to reconnect, no matter how high temperatures get.
Extreme heat in Southern Nevada led to at least 114 heat-related deaths in Clark County this year, according to the county’s coroner’s office.
Joanne Leovy, a family physician and the chair of Nevada Clinicians for Climate Action, said people often focus on the immediate fatalities caused by heat, like heat stroke, but prolonged exposure to extreme heat can negatively impact people’s health in a number of other ways.
“It’s a lot harder for us to keep in mind all the simple things that happen. We know the biggest cause of death and illness related to heat isn’t actually heat stroke, it’s cardiovascular problems like heart attacks,” Leovy said. 
Regular exposure to extreme heat – like that experienced by outdoor workers – can also lead to kidney disease.
“I think most people with chronic kidney disease don’t understand that heat can be a part of that,” Leovy said.
During the EcoMadres’ 2nd Annual Summit Friday community advocates and lawmakers highlighted Nevada’s failure to address extreme heat and where the state has seen improvements. 
Leovy said there is a real lack of education around heat’s impact on health in Nevada, including among physicians. Without education communities are less informed about how they can protect their health. 
“We as a community in Las Vegas have only started talking about extreme heat in the last two to three years,” Leovy said.
“We can educate patients in the office. One of the issues with heat is that there are a number of medications that people take on a chronic daily basis that make them much more susceptible to heat illness” unbeknownst to the patient, Leovy said.
High blood pressure medications and most psychotropic medications – antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, stimulants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers – can make people more vulnerable to heat illness. 
Health conditions such as diabetes and obesity can limit people’s ability to regulate their body heat and increase their exposure to extreme heat. Old age also increases risk of heat-related illness, and respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, such as asthma, are exacerbated by heat, said Leovy.
While there are steps people can take to protect their health in extreme heat, a systemic approach and long-term investments will be required to increase public health as extreme heat grows.
“In patients I’ve treated, there’s an overlap between having difficulty cooling your home, having a job that gives you indoor or outdoor heat exposure, and having barriers to transportation,” Leovy said. 
“As a community and as a state it’s good for us to address all those issues to help people be cooler,” she continued.
Nevada Assemblymembers Howard Watts and Cinthia Zermeño Moore spoke at the summit about legislative victories for environmental justice bills that address extreme heat. 
One of those measures that passed was Assembly Bill 96, which requires the state’s two most populous counties to actively address extreme heat through urban planning strategies, like creating public cooling spaces, public water access, cool building practices, and shaded areas in their development plans.
“It took us two legislative sessions to get it done,” Watts said.
Nevada’s Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed a similar bill in 2023. His reasoning was that there’s “no data definitively supporting the proposition that development is causing rising temperatures in either Washoe County or Clark County.” 
In reality, one of the major consequences of urban development is the urban heat island that results in cities being, on average, warmer than adjacent rural landscapes. 
“We need to think much more broadly about heat,” Watts said. “How do we build cooler cities and communities? I’m hopeful that integrating that into how our cities and counties do planning across the board, and not in isolated silos, will make a meaningful difference for our communities.”
Lombardo also signed Assembly Bill 458, a bipartisan measure that expands access to rooftop solar for Nevada families living in affordable housing. The bill will help lower power utilities for low-income households, said Watts.
“As we’re looking for solutions, we’re looking for hope. That’s an example of something that we were able to do,” Watts said.
“Hopefully soon, when you look at apartment buildings and other affordable housing throughout our community, you’re going to start to see solar panels going up on those and know that folks that previously didn’t have access to solar energy are now going to be able to see those benefits and are going to be able to lower their bills,” he said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-3-5-25-at-4.44-PM-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-09-15 08:56:48.222373

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey listens in the background. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)There’s a lot to dislike about the CHOOSE Act, Alabama’s effective voucher program.
Like forcing poorer Alabamians to pay for a wealthy family’s private education. Or the lack of income eligibility limits. Or state leaders cheering the “popularity” of the program, which has a real chance of blowing a hole in the Education Trust Fund budget in the coming years, as happened in Arizona.
In light of all that, Gov. Kay Ivey and Alabama House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter’s demands that CHOOSE Act athletes get special treatment may seem minor. But they’re also revealing.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Like most Alabama political crises, this started with someone daring to make an obvious observation. The Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA) considers the tax credits awarded to recipients of the CHOOSE Act — up to $7,000 per child — a form of financial aid.
Hard to argue with that. The CHOOSE Act covers “non-public education expenses,” but the data shows the program is an effective subsidy for private school tuition and homeschool expenses.
And because it’s financial aid, the athletic association until earlier this month required CHOOSE Act athletes to sit out one year.
For good reason. You don’t want a bunch of deep-pocketed private schools — or a person with deep pockets creating St. Sebastian’s School for Blue Chip Offensive Linemen — luring athletes from smaller public school programs with scholarships or tuition breaks, draining talent from multiple levels of high school athletics.
But not everyone sees this as an issue. In a lawsuit filed earlier this month, Ivey and Ledbetter effectively argued that CHOOSE Act recipients deserve special treatment.
“Enforcement of AHSAA’s financial aid rule as currently written would deprive affected students of invaluable or irreplaceable experiences and competitive opportunity that cannot be recovered once lost,” the lawsuit said.
The proper response to this? Too bad. Parents make choices. There are rules governing those choices. If you decide that enrolling your child in a private school is the best thing for your child, you live with the consequences.
But in Alabama, consequences only affect the bottom 99%. The state got a temporary restraining order against the provision earlier this month, a sign that Alabama is likely to prevail in the case. The way legislators wrote the law — with a clause saying that the act will not affect athletic eligibility — the athletic association might have a hard time making its argument.
Montgomery Circuit Court J.R. Gaines said the association’s other financial aid regulations remain in effect, but good luck enforcing those now. Just tell a promising young athlete at a small school that they can go to a well-endowed private one, and the floodgates will open up. Public schools will suffer more for the convenience of private ones.
Which is what the CHOOSE Act is all about.
Forget the nonsense supporters broadcast about this student or that one getting “rescued” from some public school. Most recipients are already out of the state public school system. And let’s not forget these self-styled saviors uphold a state tax system that ensures a handful of public schools get adequate resources, while many poor and rural ones do not.
This is at a time when there are some very mild restrictions on who can access the CHOOSE Act. Those caps expire in 2027. And so will the benevolent pretenses of the law.
Even now, the income tax credit doesn’t cover the average yearly cost of Alabama private school tuition (currently about $8,300). It will cover even less of it in two years, thanks to inflation and the mounting evidence that laws like the CHOOSE Act result in private schools raising their costs.
The CHOOSE ACT by its very nature provides help to those who don’t need it. Its main purpose is and always will be welfare for the wealthy. And we can’t have fairness ruining that.
But that’s Alabama’s approach to public schools. Our state believes that some people deserve a good education, and many more do not.
The white planters who created our modern state government in the 1870s had no interest in letting Alabamians govern themselves. They wanted to hoard money and power. They particularly hated the thought of any wealth they extracted from Black labor going to educate Black workers’ children.
That’s why we have property tax caps. That’s why there’s no right to a public education in our state constitution. That’s why we force Alabamians to pay high sales taxes, even on our food.
And it’s why we have the CHOOSE Act. Our lawmakers don’t see public education as a civic virtue, but as a leech on privilege. Or at best, a profit opportunity.
In that light, it’s no surprise we spent public resources finding another carve-out for the children of Alabama’s big mules. Fears of corruption matter less than the terrifying thought of a private school kid being inconvenienced.
And there’s no bigger inconvenience to elite privilege than public education.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nathaniel-Ledbetter-Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 08:56:48.222373

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Here in Nevada, it’s baseball season. And no, not the incoming Las Vegas A’s or Summerlin South’s Little League title. I’m talking about the insider baseball our Democratic leaders are playing. Instead of standing up to Governor Lombardo and a GOP floating inhumane ideas like a “Coyote Compound” detention camp, they’re huddled with Hollywood executives and the very governor they claim to oppose — hammering out billion-dollar giveaways.
And for what? Film tax credits are a proven bad investment. Connecticut’s program returned just seven cents on the dollar. Other states average barely twenty cents back—and those are states with income taxes. Nevada has none, which means the return will be even worse. Georgia leveraged its financial future in Hollywood, and Disney still ran to London. Maryland expanded its program to keep Veep, only to watch the show bolt for California. Michigan cut school and police budgets because of the drain of its program , and once they had to scale the program back, the movie Detroit—you read that correctly—left to film in Massachusetts instead. And in Massachusetts, the payoff was one sided: 66% of wages went to out-of -state residents, many of them actors and directors. Working people got nothing but the bill.
After a tumultuous election last year, and an even more chaotic seven months under the current administration, one thing is clear: voters are desperate for leaders who will actually fight for them. In Nevada, that desperation is on full display. Broadacres was forced to shutter for weeks, tourism numbers are in free fall, and Governor Joe Lombardo has even commissioned the National Guard to work with ICE. You’d think there would be no better time to be a Democrat. Yet somehow, it’s never  been worse.
The Democratic Party’s approval rating has cratered to 33%. Longtime donors have closed their wallets. One put it bluntly: “They want us to spend money, and for what? For no message, no organization, no forward thinking.”
But there are still glimmers of hope across the country. In New York City, voters overwhelmingly supported a pitch from Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani, despite an attempt at election interference by Donald Trump. In Texas, Democrats fled their homes and families to deny a quorum on Donald Trump’s rigged redistricting scheme.  They holed up in motels, hunted by the FBI, threatened with losing their seats—all to stand between their voters and a blatant power grab. Texas’s legislature is part time, meaning many of them also put their full time jobs on the line. They temporarily stopped the corrupt special session and drew national attention to the blatant power grab. 
After they returned, Texas Democrats lived under constant surveillance. Police details shadowed them everywhere. Those who initially resisted were forced to remain inside the Texas House building until they signed away their rights, unable to go home to their families. Donald Trump’s authoritarian grab unfortunately succeeded, and Democrats were strong-armed into passing the new congressional maps. While California Democrats have taken notice, responding with the “Election Rigging Response Act,”, Nevada Democrats have continued down the same old path. 
Democrats in Texas risked arrest for their constituents. Democrats in Nevada are working out of the public’s eye against their very own. 
Nevada Democrats just rallied throughout the state under the slogan “Benefits Over Billionaires,” vowing to fight for working families, Medicaid recipients, and SNAP beneficiaries. Yet behind closed doors, they’re plotting to revive the same film tax credits that a state report warned would drain more than $1 billion from the budget and force deeper service cuts.
When billionaires come knocking with studio proposals, the doors fly open. When working families ask for healthcare, rent relief, or a seat at the table, excuses pile up. You can’t be the party of “benefits over billionaires” in daylight, then cozy up to the billionaire class when the cameras are off.
This isn’t just about Hollywood—it’s about who and what we value. Nevadans are facing a 17.5% health insurance rate hike. The state’s 856,000 Medicaid recipients are at risk. Wallethub listed Nevada as the 4th most expensive housing market in the country, and similar studies rank the state in the top 5 for most expensive child care. Democratic voters aren’t looking for a new deal for billionaire executives—they’re hungry for a new deal for themselves.
Now is the time to fight. For your constituents who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads. For the Nevadans under risk of unprecedented rate hikes. For our community members too afraid to send their kids to school. Nearly 80% of Nevadans believe corporations should be paying more, not less.  When voters tell you what matters, believe them.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/state-seal-and-flag-1024x669.jpg,,,2025-09-15 08:56:48.222373

HOST: Paul Hattis & John McDonough
GUEST: Dr. Kiame Mahaniah, Health and Human Services Secretary







MASSACHUSETTS’S NEW SECRETARY of Health and Human Services has long had equity on his mind, even if national pressures now discourage using social justice language to describe it.  
“The way I think of health equity is the capacity of the system to spend more resources and more money on those who need it the most,” Dr. Kiame Mahaniah said on the latest episode of The Codcast.  
“Even though ‘Trump 2’ tries to stay away from the word equity, when they talk about rural health, they’re talking about equity. When they’re talking about substance use disorder, they’re talking about equity,” he said. “When they’re talking about bringing in a digital infrastructure and rural areas, that’s digital equity. They’re using different words, but the concepts – that the more pain that you’re in, the more services you should receive – I think those are right. Those are accepted concepts. And I don’t see us veering away from that in Massachusetts.” 
This week, on the monthly Health or Consequences episode of The Codcast, John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute spoke with Mahaniah as part of CommonWealth Beacon’s health care access month and its special “Critical Condition” coverage. 
Mahaniah served as undersecretary of health for most of Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh’s tenure. Upon Walsh’s departure for personal reasons in July, Gov. Maura Healey appointed Mahaniah as a permanent replacement.  
Massachusetts was already dealing with system stressors before the second Trump administration began, Hattis and Mahaniah noted. That included the primary care crisis, provider burnout, and difficulty for certain regions and populations to reliably access the health care they need.  
“As the improvement engineers say, your system is designed to get the results that it’s getting,” he said. The current system is complex and built on “a financing system that is not favoring primary care,” he said. 
Massachusetts, rather than a fee-for-service model, could consider payment systems that force a certain amount of primary care spending or work on a pre-paid prospective model. 
But when it comes to ensuring access to medical care like vaccines facing federal complications, the state is in a difficult position. While the Healey administration is crafting a process for recommending vaccines separate from the federal government’s position, there will likely still be issues securing those vaccines at an affordable rate, Mahaniah said. 
“I think the harder part is what’s going to happen to the purchasing and the distribution of these vaccines, because that was really coordinated by the CDC, and it was predicated on the CDC covering the vaccines from its own committee,” he said.  
The federal government was able to purchase tens of millions of doses for a negotiated rate that even a collaboration of states just cannot match, he said. “Will that whole infrastructure go away – meaning the ability to order vaccines and distribute them? … We really do worry about the purchase, the distribution, and then of course, the impact that it could have on health coverage.” 
On the podcast, McDonough, Hattis, and Mahaniah discuss looming Medicaid cuts (5:30), the primary care crisis (19:15), and how to make sure the vulnerable can still access health services (26:30).

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-15 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Constitution Pipeline: What to know about the controversial gas project,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/15/constitution-pipeline-natural-gas-new-york-pennsylvania-ct/,The Constitution Pipeline will link up with two existing pipelines that serve both CT and the wider region.,"At first glance, the route of one of America’s most controversial pipeline projects might not seem to have much to do with New England.
The proposed 125-mile pipeline between Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale field and upstate New York, however, is part of a long-standing effort to increase the flow of natural gas into parts of Connecticut and, by extension, the neighboring states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire.
Such efforts have recently drawn interest from a politically-diverse group of figures such as Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont as well as Republican President Donald J. Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, all of whom view natural gas as a way of reducing the region’s cost-of-energy burden.
Opponents, meanwhile, argue that building a new pipeline will only worsen pollution and the release of climate-altering greenhouse gases, while doing little to bring down prices. 
What is the Constitution Pipeline?
The Constitution Pipeline is being developed by Williams Companies, a large operator of pipelines across the United States. The pipeline would have the ability to carry up to 650 million cubic feet of gas a day, according to the company, enough to serve about 3 million homes.
Williams first received federal approvals to build the pipeline more than a decade ago, but the project hit a snag when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation declined to issue a water quality permit in 2016.
The project continued to languish until the developers resubmitted applications to state and federal regulators earlier this year. 
“Williams remains committed to advancing the Constitution Pipeline project and has submitted permit applications,” to regulators in New York and Pennsylvania, the company said in a statement this month. “We are also continuing to work with the states, Congress, and the Administration to strengthen U.S. energy markets, lower costs for American families, and support long-term economic growth.”
Pending those approvals, Williams estimates that the pipeline should begin construction next year and enter service near the end of 2027. 
Is Connecticut involved?
While the Constitution Pipeline itself will not carry gas into Connecticut, its terminus in New York will link up with two existing pipelines — the Tennessee and Iroquois systems — that serve both the state and the wider region.
Those pipelines already operate at or near capacity, officials say, creating a supply bottleneck particularly during winter months when gas is used to both heat homes and fuel the power plants that produce the bulk of the region’s electricity.
In order to reduce that bottleneck, pipeline operators in Connecticut are pursuing their own expansion projects.
Iroquois pipeline’s owners, for example, are seeking to build a series of compressors that would push an additional 125 million cubic feet of gas through the each day, an increase of 8.3% over its existing capacity. Meanwhile, Canadian energy company Enbridge has its own plans to expand its regional pipeline, the Algonquin, by 2029.
Carolina Kulbeth, a spokesperson for Tennessee Pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, said in a statement that expanding pipeline capacity is “critical” to eliminating existing constraints on gas supply.
“New pipeline infrastructure is the only way to ensure reliability and affordability in the New England region, as demand continues to rise among residential, commercial, and industrial customers,” Kulbeth said. 
Trump himself has touted the pipeline’s benefits, saying that it would lower energy prices by up to $5,000 per family in the Northeast — figures that critics say are wildly inflated.
“I can tell you Connecticut wants it and all of New England wants it,” Trump said in March. “And who wouldn’t it?”
What does it have to do with wind?
In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that the resurrection of the Constitution Pipeline was linked to negotiations between the Trump administration and New York over the fate of another project, Empire Wind.
Federal authorities had pulled permits for the wind project in April, only to reverse course around the same time that Williams resubmitted its pipeline applications. 
While New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has denied making any explicit promises to approve the pipeline, she has expressed a willingness to work with the administration and developers on unnamed “new energy projects” that comply with state law. 
Lamont, however, has strongly suggested that the two projects are intertwined. 
After the Trump administration last week ordered a halt in construction on another wind project being staged in New London, Lamont expressed surprise at the decision given his prior support for the development of new pipelines. 
“We’re already having very productive conversations with Williams pipeline company and [the secretaries] of Energy and Interior regarding how we can get additional sources of power here to this region, including American natural gas,” Lamont said. “So I don’t think there’s a conflict there.” 
What do opponents say?
Critics of pipeline expansion argue that projects such as Constitution are at odds with the commitments made by local elected officials to slowly wean the region off of its reliance on fossil fuels. Connecticut, for example, has laws pledging to get all of the state’s power needs from carbon-free sources no later than 2040 and achieving economy-wide net-zero emissions 10 years after that.
In addition, they point to the region’s already sky-high energy prices to argue that importing more natural gas is not an effective solution. 
“This is not about what’s better for the climate, or air or energy costs,” said Samantha Dynowski, the Connecticut state director for the Sierra Club. “This is about, you know, Trump’s buddies, his fossil fuel buddies.”
During his presidential campaign last year, Trump pledged to ease environmental restrictions and approve new drilling, pipeline and other fossil fuel projects. At the same time, he attempted to solicit $1 billion in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry.
Pipeline projects such as the Iroquois and Algonquin expansion projects have also faced local opposition in Connecticut, particularly in Brookfield where residents have complained about plans to build a new compressor station in close proximity to a middle school.
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced its tentative approval of the compressor on July 31.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP807089399687-1024x672.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Suspended thousands of feet in the New Mexico skies Sunday, Pojoaque Pueblo Gov. Jenelle Roybal could see the indelible impressions of Pueblo Bonito nestled under Fajada Butte.
Built by Ancient Pueblo society, the half dome structure constitutes  the most recognizable archaeological site in the Chaco Culture National Historical Park in the state’s northwestern corner. 
However, recent federal efforts to revoke a 10-mile buffer zone for oil and gas development around Chaco Culture National Historical Park threaten the sacred site for New Mexico Pueblos, the Hopi Indians of Arizona and the Navajo Nation.

In a plane, the buffer just across the butte is crossed in minutes. Beyond it extends miles of oil and gas development in the Mancos Shale in the San Juan Basin. One of the busiest gas producing areas in the U.S. from the air, the land is marked with the straight cuts of roads ending in oil pads and pumpjacks. 
“That land was really torn up —  it’s just roads everywhere, that land’s never going to go back to the way it was,” Roybal said from the Double Eagle II airport in Albuquerque Sunday morning. 
Roybal said protecting the sacred site is crucial not only for tribal sovereignty, but also for holding the connection to the site’s sacred value.
“Any land in New Mexico impacted affects my people,” she said.
The flight, provided by volunteer pilots with the conservation organization LightHawk and the Acoma-based Native Land Institute,  kicks off a week of advocacy during which at least 10 Pueblo governors are headed to Washington D.C. to meet with U.S. Congress members to press for further protections as the Trump administration vows to “unleash” oil and gas development. 
In April, members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation re-introduced federal legislation to make permanent a Biden-era ban on development within 10 miles of  the site. But a competing Republican-backed bill and the Trump Administration’s efforts to unwind the order are threatening that progress, the delegation said in a June letter.

Roybal recently went to Washington D.C. with other tribal governors to meet with U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, to urge further protections for preventing oil and gas encroachment around Chaco Canyon. 
She said Burgum,  who personally attended the August meeting,  seemed receptive to visiting Chaco Canyon in the future. 
“He definitely wanted to continue the conversation,” Roybal said of the meeting with Burgum. “He was very interested in coming out and looking. I think that’s important, it’s where they need to see their impact. ”
Joey Sanchez, a former governor of Santa Ana Pueblo and now a tribal liaison with Native Lands Institute, said protecting Chaco means keeping “a living museum” alive and connects generations of Pueblo people throughout time. 
“When you go to touch the walls, that spirituality comes back to life with you,” he said.
Federal efforts to revoke buffer zone around Chaco Canyon prompt delegation letter

Alyssa Sanchez (Santa Ana Pueblo), 32, said she wants to protect Chaco for future generations, and worries that further pollution or encroachment will despoil the site for her young nephews and others. 
“You really can tell from a bird’s-eye-view that while 10 miles seems like a lot, it isn’t even two minutes in a plane,” she said. “That damage is going to spread, 10 miles is nothing, it’s just sad.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pueblo-Bonito-1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

If successful, it will imperil nearly a half-billion dollars lawmakers counted on for state budgets. (Getty Images)Comcast is suing to block a new Washington law imposing sales tax on advertising services, imperiling a financial linchpin lawmakers relied on to balance the state’s budget.
The cable giant contends that the statute set to take effect Oct. 1 violates federal law because it does not apply the tax to all advertising services in the same manner.
Attorneys for the corporation also assert that parts of the law are not allowed under the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bars states from imposing “discriminatory taxes” on electronic commerce. 
“Almost all forms of advertising conducted over the Internet are subject to the tax, while most forms of advertising conducted off the Internet are not subject to the tax,” they wrote.
If Comcast succeeds in getting the tax overturned, it could force major recalibrations in the budget.
Striking the tax on advertising services alone would reduce tax collections by roughly $475 million over the next four fiscal years, said Mikhail Carpenter, a spokesperson for the state’s Department of Revenue.
The lawsuit filed in Thurston County Superior Court on Sept. 9 names the state and the Department of Revenue as main defendants. 
A Comcast spokesman said the lawsuit lays out the company’s concerns and declined to comment further.
Department of Revenue officials are reviewing it with legal counsel, Carpenter said.
The fight centers on a section of Senate Bill 5814, a major expansion of business taxes passed by the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate in April and signed by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson in May. Republicans in both chambers opposed the bill.
This bill is counted on to raise roughly $1.1 billion in this two-year budget and $2.7 billion over four years, much of it by charging the retail sales and use tax on more services, such as digital advertising, security services and temporary staffing.
It is one of the largest pieces of a $9.4 billion package that Democrats approved in April to balance the current budget, and the next one as well.
Comcast is contesting provisions that will require sales tax be collected for ads sold by streaming services, while exempting advertising services of newspapers, radio and television broadcasting, as well as on billboards and buses. Naming rights and ads in stadiums will not be subject to the tax either.
This would mean, for example, a Seattle television station won’t charge sales tax on ads sold to a local business, but a streaming service like Netflix must charge sales tax if it sells an ad to the same business.
“These excluded categories of advertising were drawn in such a way that the burden of the tax falls on Internet-based advertising, rather than non-Internet based advertising,” reads the lawsuit.
The lawsuit is not raising a new issue.
A coalition of streaming services, including Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock, and the Walt Disney Co., urged Ferguson to veto the bill, arguing the new advertising tax would lead to higher costs for customers or fewer options if services leave the market.
“Singling out one segment of the ad economy for this kind of discriminatory treatment is the wrong way to address the state’s fiscal needs and would do far more harm than good,” the Streaming Innovation Alliance told the governor in a letter.
The Department of Revenue is in the process of writing final rules for implementation of the tax law. 
As part of the process, in July, it held two “listening sessions” in which business owners and operators sought clarity on what advertising services would be covered, questioned the legality of the approach, and expressed concern consumers would be negatively impacted.
The department expects to issue “interim guidance” on advertising service in the next two weeks, Carpenter said. It will provide taxpayers with instructions “they can rely on while the department continues to review issues and adopts final interpretive guidance.”
This guidance will not address the legal issues raised by the lawsuit, he said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gavel-and-money-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

(Getty Images)The Indiana Department of Correction will begin sending payments to dozens of counties on Monday to cover costs for housing state prisoners, ending months of delays that left local jails without reimbursements.
“In recent months, the Indiana Department of Correction has been working to ensure calculations of any money owed to the counties are accurate,” DOC spokesperson Annie Goeller said in a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
She explained that two separate streams of payments are at issue: funding tied to Level 6 felony diversions, and per diem reimbursements for state prisoners held in county jails awaiting transfer.
Story continues below.
County Hold Master Summary - FY 2025
 
Level 6 offenders used to be sent to state prisons until a criminal justice overhaul in 2013. After that, low-level felons were kept in local jails at state expense.
Goeller said the outstanding costs associated with Level 6 diversions were governed by a funding formula established by the General Assembly in 2019.
“This formula has since become outdated and no longer reflects current data, resulting in overpayments to several counties,” she said.
To resolve that, DOC will forgive those debts rather than seek repayment, Goeller said.
In total, the department will forgive about $7.7 million in overpayments across 51 counties, including large amounts in Kosciusko County, which was overpaid nearly $599,000; Greene County, which was overpaid more than $254,000; and Clark County, where the overpayment was about $264,000, according to a DOC payment summary provided to the Capital Chronicle.
Indiana Department of Correction readies to pay $12 million in jail back payments

The department will also resume reimbursements for jail holds, where inmates who have been convicted of state crimes remain in county jails until DOC picks them up. 
State law requires pickup within five days, but counties are reimbursed at a daily rate for each additional day an inmate is held. 
The General Assembly raised that per diem earlier this year, and Goeller said DOC currently owes counties “approximately $6.1 million to 41 counties for these holds.” 
“The department will begin reimbursing these counties immediately,” she added.
The largest payments are set to go to several northern Indiana counties with high numbers of state holds. 
Elkhart County is owed more than $638,000 for 34,024 days of holds, while St. Joseph County is owed nearly $397,000 for 21,910 days. In Lake County, where 13,463 hold days were recorded, the reimbursement totals just under $178,000.
Additionally, Delaware County will receive roughly $216,000 and Vigo County about $290,000 — both for more than 10,000 days of holds. Hendricks County, meanwhile, is set to receive more than $171,000. 
Other counties are owed smaller amounts, such as Monroe County at about $53,000; Jennings County at nearly $27,000; and Fountain County at about $39,000, the DOC summary shows.
Goeller said the reimbursements will come in a single distribution next week, and that “money will come from IDOC’s budget, which includes funding for jail payments.”

Bob Ferguson signed an executive order Sept. 3 creating Your Washington, a division of the executive branch that will focus on improving how the state delivers services to residents. Jesse Jones, the director, speaks with Ferguson after the signing. (Photo courtesy of governor's office.)For two decades, embattled consumers knew having investigative journalist Jesse Jones on their side could very likely make things right for them.
Now, Gov. Bob Ferguson is counting on Jones to level up such success for residents across the state.
Ferguson renamed and rebranded Results Washington, an obscure data-driven creation of his predecessor, into a “customer experience hub” called Your Washington that launched this week. He hired Jones in January to lead the transformation, which became formal with Ferguson’s signing of an executive order on Sept. 3.
“Washingtonians know that when there is a problem to be solved, you get Jesse,” Ferguson said in January. “Government must work better. Jesse’s track record makes him an ideal candidate for this role.” 
The executive order directs agencies under Ferguson’s control to provide Your Washington staff with an overview of how they account for customer experience and track their delivery of key services. In six months, each agency must begin implementing a Customer Experience Improvement Plan. Quarterly progress reports must be filed with Your Washington.
“In my inaugural address, I promised to improve customer service in state government. We’re going to make it happen,” Ferguson posted on social media after signing the executive order.
Ferguson’s effort follows a series of initiatives along these lines that Washington governors have pursued over the past three decades.
As part of the governor’s order, Jones and his staff are working with WaTech, the state’s IT agency, to expand wa.gov, the state’s existing online portal to state services, programs and information. 
The Your Washington website, meanwhile, is a place where residents can share their experiences and state employees can learn best practices for serving the public.
Jones said there are plans for a hotline for people to call to leave complaints and compliments about government agencies. There is also going to be a small studio where “folks can come in and tell their customer service story,” he said.
And, each quarter, two state employees “who embody the spirit of service excellence” will be recognized. They’ll be chosen based on the nominations from the public, Jones said.
“Our role is to assist, embrace and help these agencies do their best with customer experience,” said Jones, who joined Ferguson following 20 years as an investigative and consumer reporter with two Seattle television stations. “It is a huge undertaking for a group of 10 people,” he said.
In search of better customer service
Customers, in the vision of Your Washington, are “anyone who interacts with a state program or service” including residents, businesses, organizations, and agency employees.
Customer experience, or CX for short, is defined as “a shared mindset” in the design of services for those who use and deliver them.
The website has a resource page with links to research and tools for better understanding the mindset of customers. There is information on practices such as influence mapping and empathy mapping to help employees get a broader picture of those affected by a potential decision.
Jones, in a statement on the website, says customer experience “doesn’t start at the front counter – IT STARTS INSIDE. How leaders support staff, and how managers treat their teams, directly shapes the experience we deliver to the public.”
A new way to address an old idea
Ferguson is the latest Washington governor with a scheme to make state agencies relevant and responsive.
In the late 90s, Gov. Gary Locke unfurled priorities of government to figure out what services people most wanted and needed from the state, and how to best fund them.
Gov. Christine Gregoire followed with Government Management Accountability and Performance, which she introduced in February 2005, her second month in office. It called for developing “clear, relevant and easy-to-understand measures” to show whether programs were successful. Department managers to front-line employees were required to work “creatively and cooperatively” across agency lines “to improve government service.”
Then came Gov. Jay Inslee with Results Washington in September 2013, his first year on the job. Its team did deep dives in data collection, then used findings to craft policies in the areas of education, economy, clean energy and environment, health and safety, and government accountability. A lot of the data is retained on the Your Washington site.
With Results Washington, the director was responsible for “implementing a continued customer-oriented approach to state government” centered on expanding public participation “in efforts to improve our state.”
For his endeavor, Ferguson is counting on Jones’ media savvy to further enhance public interest and awareness in such work. 
“Washingtonians deserve efficient, responsive, and person-focused government services that respect their time and meet their needs,” Ferguson said in an emailed statement. “This executive order is the next step in our efforts to ensure we deliver.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/YourWashington-6-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in south Minneapolis last month has state lawmakers searching for ways to reduce gun violence, which is the leading cause of death for children in the United States. 
Minnesota already has stricter-than-average gun laws, and it’s not clear whether any of the gun control measures up for discussion would have prevented a 23-year-old Minnesota resident from firing more than 100 rounds through the windows of Annunciation during the first Mass of the school year. 
Even if Minnesota had banned semiautomatic military-style assault weapons, like the one used by the shooter, they’re available for purchase in every surrounding state. The assailant also brought a shotgun and handgun to the school.
The shooter would have passed background checks and didn’t trigger the state’s red flag law, which allows courts to order the confiscation of weapons from people who threaten their own life or others. 
In other words, America’s permissive gun culture and laws — cultivated over many decades by the gun lobby and bipartisan but now mostly Republican politicians and their supporters — mean that even the most rigorous measures taken by individual states can only reduce deaths around the margins in a country that’s home to nearly 400 million firearms.
But those measures and others can still prevent future gun deaths, and are worth implementing, according to studies and gun violence prevention researchers.
In states with more permissive gun laws and higher gun ownership rates, more people die in shootings — and the gap between states with permissive and restrictive gun laws is growing, according to one study.  
Although mass shootings draw the most attention, only 1% of firearm deaths in the U.S. occur in mass shootings. Most are suicides, and some are accidental deaths. Others are isolated homicides, many of which are committed by intimate partners. 


America’s penchant for owning guns is striking compared to other countries. For every 100 Americans, there are 120 civilian guns, according to Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey — far more than the second-highest, which is 62 guns per 100 people in the Falkland Islands.
“I am not going to allow anyone to try and make the case that the United States is unique in either mental health issues or other things,” Walz said on Sept. 2 while announcing plans to call a special legislative session on gun violence. “The thing that makes America unique in terms of shootings is we just have more guns and the wrong types of guns that are on the streets.”


Walz’s priority for the special session is banning firearms like the AR-15-style rifle used by the Annunciation shooter. A DFL-led Senate Working Group on Gun Violence Prevention will evaluate other special session proposals this week.
“My hope is that the special session will be focused on the future as well — on what could prevent the next shooting — because it’s not going to be exactly what happened (at Annunciation),” said Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins University. 
Here’s what data and experts say about the effectiveness of various gun control policies: 
Assault weapon and high-capacity magazine bans
What constitutes an “assault weapon” varies state-to-state, but definitions usually include semi-automatic firearms that accept a detachable magazine and include one or more “military-style” features, such as a folding or telescoping stock.
Semi-automatic firearms fire one bullet each time the trigger is pulled, and automatically reloads the next bullet as the trigger is released. Most popular handguns, like the Glock 22, are semi-automatic; so are AR-15s and AK-47s. (Automatic firearms, which fire continuously while the trigger is pulled, and devices that convert semi-automatic weapons to automatic are highly restricted by federal law.)
Minnesota law lists 17 firearm makes and models, and all those with similar specifications, as “semiautomatic military-style assault weapons.”

Since 2000, one-third of mass shootings involved assault weapons, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Prevention Project at Hamline University. Most mass shootings — 52% — involved handguns. 
A majority of the deadliest mass shootings, however — like those in Uvalde, Sutherland Springs, Orlando and Sandy Hook — involved assault rifles. 
AR-15s and AK-47s are often selected by mass shooters for their ease of use and high velocity, which creates shockwaves that cause devastating damage to bodies even with smaller bullets than many handguns. A 2025 study found that the use of an assault weapon is associated with a slight increase in the number of injuries and deaths in mass shooting incidents. 
The federal government banned the sale of assault weapons from 1994 to 2004, but people who purchased those guns before the ban took effect were allowed to keep them.
During the federal assault weapons ban, mass shooting incidents and deaths decreased. The trend reversed when the ban expired in 2004. 
Ten states ban assault weapons. Fourteen states prohibit high-capacity magazines, usually defined as those with more than 10 rounds. (The standard magazine size for an AR-15 is 30 rounds, but some magazines hold up to 100 bullets.)
Some studies show that state-level high-capacity magazine bans reduce public mass shootings and fatalities. 
There is less evidence that state-level assault weapons bans have the same effect, in part because laws vary widely from state-to-state, making comparisons difficult, said Roskam, the Johns Hopkins researcher. 
Because high-capacity magazine bans and assault weapons bans often go hand-in-hand, researchers struggle to disentangle the two policies. 
Regardless: “It is incredibly clear that assault weapons are used in and facilitate a lot of mass shootings. And despite the lack of clear evidence, because of some of the research limitations that I identified, we do feel that they would have a protective effect,” Roskam said.
A range of factors could limit the impact of a state-level ban: The grandfathering-in of existing weapons; the ease of transporting firearms across state lines; and the rush to purchase affected weapons before a ban takes effect.
Extreme risk protection orders, or “red flag” laws
If a person poses a significant threat of bodily harm to others or is at risk of suicide, family members or law enforcement officers can ask a judge to order the confiscation of that person’s firearms for up to one year.
This policy, called an “extreme risk protection order” or “red flag law” took effect in January 2024 after the DFL-controlled Legislature passed a law in 2023.

Extreme risk protection orders can reduce gun deaths, including suicides, homicides and mass shootings, according to a limited body of research. Indiana’s red flag law is associated with a a 7.5% reduction in firearm suicides, and gun suicides declined nearly 14% in Connecticut after a similar law passed there. 
There’s also evidence that red flag laws prevent some mass shootings; For instance, out of 159 orders issued from 2016 to 2018 in California, 21 subjects displayed intent to commit a mass shooting. After their firearms were confiscated, none of those people committed suicide or homicide.
Red flag laws are relatively new, and the evidence to support their effectiveness is less robust than that of the federal assault weapons ban.
“It’s also very difficult to prove a negative — to prove the shootings that don’t happen,” said Jaclyn Schildkraut, executive director of the Regional Gun Violence Research Consortium at the Rockefeller Institute of Government.
The impact of extreme risk protection orders is dependent on the public’s knowledge of the law, and law enforcement agencies’ participation, Roskam said. 
In Minnesota, more petitions for extreme risk protection orders were filed in the first seven months of 2025 than in all of 2024, signaling increased public participation and enforcement of the law, MinnPost reported. 
Safe storage laws
In Minnesota, it’s illegal to negligently store a loaded firearm in a location where the person knows, or reasonably should know, that a child is likely to gain access, unless the owner takes “reasonable action” to prevent the child from accessing the gun.
The statute is known as a child-access prevention law, a type of safe storage law, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent suicides, accidental shootings and homicides by minors, according to several studies. 
And while there’s not substantial evidence to prove that child-access prevention laws reduce mass shootings, one study found that two-thirds of school shooters obtained their firearms from family or friends.  


The Minnesota House passed an even stricter safe storage bill in 2024, but it did not come to a vote in the Senate. That bill would have required gun owners to store their firearms unloaded and equipped with a locking device; or, loaded or unloaded, in a locked firearm storage unit or room.
Most research on safe storage policies focuses on the child access piece of the law. While safe storage laws are usually not proactively enforced, they provide a path for parents to be charged in the event that their child accesses a negligently-stored firearm and uses it in a crime.
“It’s not just about the passage of the law, or even the enforcement of the criminal penalties — It’s also about educating people about the benefits and the risks that they face from not doing it,” Roskam said.

School safety

Minnesota Republicans say they will approach a special session with a focus on school safety, rather than gun control. 
Schildkraut’s team at the Regional Gun Violence Research Consortium is examining the effectiveness of behavioral threat assessments, which are used to identify and monitor people who may pose a threat of violence to themselves or others. (Federal funding for that project was canceled earlier this year because it does not align with the Trump administration’s priorities, Schildkraut said. The research is ongoing with other funding sources.)
“To undergo a behavioral threat assessment process, you need that person to be on somebody’s radar. And when you’re thinking about schools, the people whose radar…he or she is most likely to be on, is the other students,” Schildkraut said. 
Teaching students about the warning signs and behaviors of students in crisis and creating anonymous tip lines can help schools and law enforcement agencies identify students who may pose a threat — before they commit a violent act against themselves or others.
“The firearm is the means, right? But the motivation and the method … why they’re doing this and what is underpinning all of that certainly doesn’t always revolve around that firearm,” Schildkraut said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MG_0364-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

This article coincides with the  “Welcoming Week” (September 12-21) — an annual tradition when events are organized nationwide to recognize and celebrate the contributions of immigrants in our communities and the work carried out at local levels to be welcoming places for all community members. In the spirit of this tradition, here are a few points (not to be interpreted as legal advice) that may help immigrant community members and their neighbors, friends, and advocates continue to navigate this challenging time.
Know the rights of all people in the U.S., regardless of immigration status
Everyone in the country, whether or not a U.S. citizen, has certain basic rights and protections under the U.S. Constitution. Suffice it to say here that the application of these rights can be complex and depend upon the circumstances at hand, but national and local non-profit organizations have distilled information, which has been translated into multiple languages, and, locally, private and non-profit attorneys regularly conduct information sessions tailored to current events with an eye toward empowering community members. 
Two Indianapolis-based organizations that house resources are the Immigrant Welcome Center and the Coalition for our Immigrant Neighbors. At this point, many people are familiar with “Red Cards” that list short phrases to allow people to exercise their rights in different situations.
Connect with qualified attorneys and advocates
It’s not only recommended but also can be critical to obtain the advice of a qualified and licensed attorney before applying for an immigration benefit. If appropriate for the issue, a Department of Justice accredited representative — a trained attorney authorized by the DOJ to provide immigration services — may be of assistance. If a person is in “deportation” proceedings, statistically, it is well settled that representation makes a vast difference in the outcome of the case. Several non-profit immigration service providers exist to serve eligible low-income and vulnerable immigrants in Indianapolis and statewide. The American Immigration Lawyers Association is a non-partisan, non-profit, voluntary network of immigration attorneys nationwide. Its mission includes advancing immigration attorneys’ skill and professional development, so seekers of immigration help may wish to retain a member of the AILA Indiana chapter.

Because immigration law is a federal practice area, licensure in Indiana versus another state is not required to represent Indiana-based clients in immigration court or before an immigration agency/officer, but hiring an attorney licensed in Indiana could offer practical benefits like familiarity with local resources, courts, and agencies. This Indiana Courts link shows the status of an attorney’s licensure in Indiana and disciplinary action history.
Have a family safety plan or help others form one 
Certain public spaces like schools and courthouses were exempt from immigration enforcement under a federal government policy until its rescission in January 2025, so people must invoke basic constitutional rights. An explanation from a national non-profit is publicly available here.
Any parent or caretaker may take steps to ensure the safety of their dependents if they become incapacitated for any reason, including immigration detention, and community-based resources exist. Knowing a person’s noncitizen (“A”) number is key to helping someone detained for immigration reasons. State family law governs guardianships, and power of attorney documents may be executed but may not be needed by everyone in every circumstance. For questions or concerns, consult a qualified attorney. 
Take care of yourself and others
Studies show that more than a majority of adults in the U.S. have experienced potentially traumatic events during their lives and, in my experience, most immigrant clients have experienced trauma in at least one form during their immigration journey. If they wish, immigrant survivors can connect with advocated trained to help in overcoming the effects of trauma, and this can put immigrant clients in better position to work with their attorneys on a legal case. 
For those in crisis, emotional and mental health support is available by calling/texting 988 (available in English, Spanish and to those who are deaf or hard of hearing). Vicarious or secondary trauma often affects those in roles aimed at helping survivors of trauma. Identifying signs of vicarious trauma and practicing self-care activities are at a minimum worth exploring. 
In conclusion, I hope that at least one piece of information in this article was helpful. May you be welcomed in your community, and may you be well.

Every state — usually the attorney general — decides who gets the money, how it’s allowed to be spent and whether the families most impacted by addiction can know or advise how the dollars are spent. 
When the first opioid settlements were being finalized in 2021, Mississippi’s main decision maker, Attorney General Lynn Fitch, asked the state’s towns, cities and counties to sign on to an agreement to join the lawsuits. The agreement says local governments receive 15% of Mississippi’s total share, and their elected officials can spend the money like any other public dollars without reporting where the dollars go. 
Nearly 150 Mississippi cities and counties signed onto the agreement, and most started receiving their payments in the fall of 2022. For the next two and a half years, they told their constituents almost nothing about how they were spending their money. 
Beginning in May, Mississippi Today put in records requests to all local governments receiving Mississippi opioid settlement money. One hundred and forty one of the 147 opioid governments that received opioid settlement funds told Mississippi Today how much money they’ve received and how they’ve been using the dollars. Five localities provided Mississippi Today with incomplete information, and Mound Bayou provided the newsroom with no information.
Cities and counties were scattered in the timing of their responses, from a few providing information the same day and others fulfilling requests months later. The presentation of their responses also took a variety of forms; some local record keepers provided detailed spending ledgers and official city or county meeting minutes where elected officials voted how to spend their dollars. Others replied to the email with a few sentences explaining how much money they received and how it’s being used. 
To clearly show how much money local governments have received and how they’ve been using those dollars, Mississippi Today created its database. We broadly identified five pieces of information from the responses: 

How much money a government has received
Whether a government’s settlement money is being used for a specific project and what that project is
Where a government’s settlement money is being deposited into its general fund
Where a government’s settlement money is unallocated or used for unknown purposes because the officials didn’t respond
When the locality responded to our request.

To say whether the spending addressed addiction, Mississippi Today compared a government’s response to the list of opioid prevention uses the settlements’ lawyers recommend. 
From there, we sorted the governments into:

Those that were using settlement money to address addiction
Those that were not using settlement money to address addiction
Those that used some settlement money to address addiction 
Those that did not respond to our request for spending plans 
Those that have yet to spend their dollars.

When a local government administrator provided official records that showed the money is being spent, Mississippi Today uploaded the documents and linked to the file in the database.
To make sure this information was presented accurately and consistently, Mississippi Today hired an independent fact checker to review the database. The fact checker was not paid based on the results of the assessment.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/02091825/naloxone.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446
,Mississippi Today,2025-09-15 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Mississippi cities and counties, lacking state guidance, spend millions of opioid settlement dollars on general expenses",Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/15/lacking-state-guidance-cities-counties/,"Of the over $15.5 million local governments have received, they’ve used roughly $6.4 million as of this summer. About $4.3 million of that has been designated for routine government expenses.","For the past three years, 147 towns, cities and counties have controlled millions of Mississippi opioid settlement dollars meant to address the overdose epidemic. 
However, elected officials have been much more likely to spend the money on routine government expenses than on addressing addiction, a Mississippi Today investigation found. And they are doing so legally: Attorney General Lynn Fitch allowed them to spend these dollars on any public purpose rather than addressing the public health catastrophe that’s killed over 1,300 Mississippians since the state received its first lawsuit check.
Mississippi Today filed public records requests with all cities and counties that have received National Opioid Settlement dollars to learn how much money each has received and spent. Of the over $15.5 million local governments have received, they’ve used roughly $6.4 million as of this summer. About $4.3 million of that has been designated for routine government expenses. 

Most of Mississippi’s opioid settlement money is controlled by the state Legislature, which tasked an advisory committee with recommending how lawmakers spend the state’s share to treat and prevent opioid addiction. But applications for those dollars only went out last month, and that money is unlikely to be distributed until the Legislature enacts a budget in July 2026. 
Until then, the only Mississippi lawsuit money that can likely address addiction is funds that went to the 147 local governments, which are expected to net around $48 million more in settlements over the next 15 years.  

Mississippi Today opens ‘black box’ of opioid settlement spending

Melody Worsham, a peer support specialist for the Mississippi Recovery Advocacy Project, has worked to address the harms of the addiction epidemic for over a decade. She said she sees missing resources in the state’s effort to prevent overdose deaths every day, and she hopes the settlement money will eventually go to groups such as hers that build on the knowledge of people who’ve experienced addiction. 
She said that she would be willing to fill potholes herself after Mississippi Today told her the amount of local government opioid lawsuit money being used for city and county general expenses.
“I’ve got people to volunteer to do the potholes if they stop spending the opioid money for that,” she said. “I’m disgusted. I’m disillusioned. I’m actually kind of speechless, I really am.”
Jackson County on the Gulf Coast and the city of Jackson are two of the five local governments that have received the most money in the state to date. Neither are using their dollars to address addiction, records responses show.
Jackson County, the county with the most suspected overdose deaths last year, is using over $1 million for unspecified government expenses. The city of Jackson has spent some of the roughly $547,000 it reported receiving for fiber optic cable installation, office moving expenses and a shelving system. 
Both Jackson County Board of Supervisors President Barry Cumbest and Jackson Mayor John Horhn did not respond to emails asking whether their governments have made the best use of these lawsuit dollars. Records show Horhn took office after the city of Jackson spent some of its settlement money for general purposes.
Mississippi Today could only account for about $945,000 across all 147 localities that has been spent to address and prevent addiction. Most of that went to fund mental health emergency services and drug intervention courts, programs that direct some people struggling with substance use disorder away from jails or prisons and toward treatment programs. 

Officials for the dozens of governments depositing opioid settlement checks into general expense accounts told Mississippi Today that once the money goes into those accounts, it’s impossible to trace where the dollars go. Many of them pointed to a settlement agreement and letters authored by Fitch’s office, which told local governments to use the money however they see fit.
Across the country, there’ve been other instances of local governments spending opioid lawsuit dollars for resources that may not directly address addiction. But unlike Mississippi’s contract, most states’ agreements make elected officials conform to an approved list of uses that are intended to respond to the public health crisis. 
Dr. Judith Feinberg, a West Virginia University behavioral medicine and psychiatry professor, co-authored a guide with other public health professors that lays out how states can use opioid settlement money to prevent more deadly overdoses. After reviewing Mississippi Today’s data, she said the local governments’ spending so far has been “very tragic.”

“From a public health perspective, this is complete and utter bullshit,” she said. 
After Mississippi Today sent Fitch a letter that outlined the local governments’ spending, she did not answer a question about whether she still stood by the decision to allow cities and counties to spend the money on any public purpose.
In a statement, Fitch’s Chief of Staff Michelle Williams said the opioid crisis cost hundreds of billions of dollars, expenses that affected government health care, criminal justice and social safety net services. Williams said the settlements can be used to reimburse cities and counties for some of these costs. 
It’s a different message than Fitch communicated when announcing at least one of the settlements in 2021. When an agreement was finalized with the consulting group McKinsey, her office said the funds were being provided “to address the crisis.”
In a July interview, Williams said that the attorney general’s agreement was the best way to encourage Mississippi’s towns, cities and counties to join the national opioid lawsuits. 
But she said she couldn’t recall if any local governments said they wouldn’t sign on to the lawsuits unless they could spend their money on any purpose, though she believed it helped get more to join. 
Fitch is reported to be considering a run for governor in 2026, which Feinberg said could have played into her decision. 
“It’s just politically to make everyone happy at the local level,” she said. “Like, ‘Oh, here’s a little slush fund for you. Do what you would like.’”

Pine Belt resident Jane Clair Tyner watched her son Asa Henderson struggle with opioid use until he died at 23 years old in 2019. When Mississippi Today told her about the settlement spending of the cities and counties, she said it adds heartache to the grief she continues to carry. 
Tyner said she has no interest in receiving settlement checks from the pharmaceutical companies, as the money would be better used to prevent more overdoses. But the spending shows that Fitch’s new message is the one cities and counties have taken to heart. 
“It’s just incredibly unjust,” she said. “It makes a mockery of our entire justice system. It makes a mockery of court cases. It makes a mockery of settlements.” 
‘The epidemic is marching on’
While U.S. and Mississippi overdose deaths have slightly decreased over the past two years, both the state and national death rates are higher than they were in the late 2010s, when the country’s surgeon general said combating the opioid epidemic was his top public health priority.
Dr. Caleb Alexander, a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor and an expert witness in many of the opioid settlement lawsuits, said all the money Mississippi is receiving is a valuable resource that can prevent more deaths. 
“The epidemic is marching on, and enormous harms continue to occur in cities and counties, big and small,” he said. 
Shortages in the state’s treatment and recovery resources, ones that more local financial support could help address, have likely prolonged the epidemic. A 2023 Journal of the American Medical Association study found that among Mississippians on Medicaid, a federal-state health insurance program for vulnerable people, less than a third of those diagnosed with opioid addiction received effective medication for the disease. 
Sixty-eight of Mississippi’s 82 counties didn’t have any recovery residences, also known as sober living homes, according to a 2022 report from the Public Health Institute. The report says the availability of these homes, which the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has said is crucial to curbing more overdoses, is among the lowest of any state in the country.
To Tyner, the mother who lost her son to an overdose, these are some of the resource holes that the settlement dollars could help fill. 
“We have an opportunity to open more beds, to create more community mental health centers, to make recovery possible,” she said.
The only government that reported spending its money to improve access to opioid use disorder medication or recovery residences was Horn Lake, which donated about $75,000 to a local treatment center in June. 
DeSoto County has used all of its settlement money for the construction of a new crisis stabilization unit, and Lamar County plans to do the same with its hundreds of thousands of dollars. But these centers are designed for stabilizing people in crisis or experiencing psychosis, and they don’t provide long-term services for addiction.
Melody Madaris oversees one of these units as the executive director of the community mental health center Communicare in north Mississippi. Centers like hers run both crisis stabilization units and addiction treatment programs, and she said local officials who want to prevent more overdoses should look to fund the treatment services instead.

Unlike private rehabilitation centers, addiction treatment programs at community mental health centers serve all regardless of Mississippians ability to pay. Madaris said that makes for difficult financial situations.
“We all operate in the red every year,” she said. 
Some of the Mississippi settlement spending that counts as addressing addiction is unlikely to prevent more overdose deaths, according to public health researchers. The city of Starkville is using about $15,000 for its police to teach the Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or DARE, a program that most research indicates isn’t effective at preventing drug use. 
The city of Clarksdale’s deputy clerk said the government is spending roughly $36,000 so its police and fire departments can buy more naloxone, the opioid overdose-reversing medication. But Worsham, the Mississippi peer support specialist, said the criminal nature of opioid use makes it unlikely people will call law enforcement to respond to an overdose. 
“They’re putting it in the hands of people who are least likely to be able to hand it to the people who need it,” she said. 
David Engel, the Copiah County administrator, said he believes the drug court addiction treatment program his government is sending its settlement dollars to is amazing. 
But beyond that, he said he and the supervisors are unclear how best to prevent more opioid deaths. And the attorney general’s office messages saying the money can be spent on anything aren’t helpful.
“That’s no guidance whatsoever,” he said. 
Repeating history could doom future crisis response
Dr. Rahul Gupta, the former Office of National Drug Control Policy director, said it should be the responsibility of the state government to encourage local governments how best the dollars can be used to stop the public health overdose crisis.
Fitch’s counterparts in states such as North Carolina and Utah have developed instructions for how these dollars can best be used to prevent more overdoses. Fitch did not answer a question about whether she would consider making a guide like those for the local governments.
“It’s not fair to blame them (localities) for utilizing money in different ways if we’re not providing that overarching guidance to them,” Gupta said. He added that public health bodies such as Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health have created helpful national guides for opioid settlement spending.
Only one of the 147 governments, the city of Hattiesburg, indicated that it would seek input from residents who’ve been impacted by addiction to guide how it should use its settlement funds. It reported receiving roughly $54,000 in May.


Mayor Toby Barker said in June he wanted to seek the advice of families who’ve lost loved ones, addiction treatment providers and law enforcement officers of how to best spend its dollars.
“I don’t want us to do something to do something,” he said. “I want to see Hattiesburg make a focused investment on where it can do some good.”
Feinberg, the West Virginia University professor, said community input is the best way to make sure these dollars reduce the overdose death rate. She said other local elected officials may want to look to Hattiesburg as an example of what’s possible, as she thinks it could have the best luck at saving lives.
It’s important that these dollars be spent to prevent more overdose deaths not just for this crisis but also for future ones, Gupta said. The opioid lawsuits were modeled after tobacco cases in the 1990s, and a lot of that money didn’t end up addressing the public health emergency at hand. 
If that happens again, Gupta said, judges could be hesitant to demand response money for the next public health emergency created by corporations.
“It’s going to be very difficult to argue why these are required to abate that crisis,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/11135521/MT-OpioidSettlement-story2-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

But a Mississippi Today investigation found that in the three years of receiving the funds, public officials across the state reported spending less than $1 million – or less than 1% of the money received so far – on direct measures to prevent more drug deaths.
The attorney general’s office split the money – expected to total around $421 million through 2040 – between Mississippi’s state and local governments. Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office and the Legislature oversee most of Mississippi’s opioid settlement dollars, but they’ve only spent money on attorneys’ fees so far. The remaining portion – 15% of Mississippi’s funds – goes to cities, counties and towns. 
Management of the local dollars has mostly been a mystery until now. Fitch created a contract with towns, cities and counties that allows them to spend their portion on whatever they see fit – unlike agreements in at least 34 other states. They’re also not required to report what they do with the dollars.
But how Mississippi governments spend money is information that can be requested by anyone. From May to August, Mississippi Today filed public records requests with all 147 towns, cities and counties that have received settlement dollars to find out how much they’ve gotten and how they’ve been using the funds.
The newsroom accounted for about $15.5 million and received responses from almost every city and county receiving settlement shares. It filed an ethics complaint against Mound Bayou, the only local government that didn’t provide any information. Mississippi Today tracked how that money is being spent and analyzed the data to determine how much Mississippi is spending to prevent overdoses, treat addiction and connect people with recovery.
Mississippi Today has published a database for anyone to search how local governments are spending opioid settlement dollars.

Here are some of the biggest takeaways:

Since September 2022, the 146 towns, cities and counties that responded to Mississippi Today reported receiving roughly $15.5 million. Leaders for those governments have spent about $6.4 million of that.


Around $945,000 has been used to address addiction with the strategies laid out in one of the opioid settlements, which plaintiffs’ lawyers called “an exemplar.” Most of that money has been used to support drug courts and mental health crisis intervention services. All of the states bordering Mississippi report using at least $4 million each – significantly more than Mississippi both in terms of dollars and percentage of total share – on strategies to address the overdose crisis, and most have committed tens of millions of dollars already.


The remaining $5.4 million is being used for other purposes. Local officials have deposited $4.2 million directly into accounts for general expenses, often making it impossible to track the dollars. Some expenses not related to addiction include police equipment in Oxford and fiber optic cable installation in Jackson. The city of Vicksburg purchased and firefighter suits and donated to a crisis pregnancy center.


Over the past three years, 20 of the 147 local governments have spent or finalized plans to spend some or all of their opioid settlement shares to address addiction, officials told Mississippi Today, and 53 governments have not spent or made plans to spend any opioid dollars.


Just one of the 147 governments, Hattiesburg, indicated it would create opportunities for public input on how to spend its opioid settlement dollars. Mayor Toby Barker initiated his plan after Mississippi Today submitted its public records request in May. 


Public health and legal experts who reviewed Mississippi Today’s data said the pattern of Mississippi’s local spending is a problem, as the money was won from companies that profited while residents struggled with addiction.
Representatives for the towns, cities and counties pointed out to Mississippi Today that Fitch’s contract advised them to spend their dollars for any public purpose. The attorney general has minimized the amount of Mississippi opioid settlement money that must be spent addressing addiction. 

Mississippi cities and counties, lacking state guidance, spend millions of opioid settlement dollars on general expenses

While most states have developed plans that say all opioid settlement money needs to go toward addressing addiction, the Mississippi attorney general’s version says the state can use 30% of its dollars on other purposes, the most allowed by the national lawsuit settlements. Fitch included all of the local dollars in that 30%.
In addition to the attorney general’s directive, some city and county officials said the small amounts they were receiving made it difficult to identify the right addiction-related project. They instead highlighted other efforts they have undertaken to address substance use disorder, like funding local drug courts with other public dollars.
Mississippi Today emailed Fitch a letter with these findings, and she did not answer whether she still believes it was the right decision to allow cities and counties such free rein. Her chief of staff, Michelle Williams, said in a statement that the opioid crisis has cost the country hundreds of billions of dollars, and the settlements allow state and local governments to pay for prior opioid expenses over the past three decades. 
She said the attorney general’s office is working with the Legislature and a new state opioid settlement advisory committee to use the majority of Mississippi’s settlement dollars to prevent more overdoses.
“The Attorney General’s Office is committed to doing everything we can to get the money out to where it is needed quickly,” Williams wrote. 
But the state’s share likely won’t be distributed until July 2026, after the Legislature passes its next budget. Until then, the local dollars are the only Mississippi opioid settlement funds expected to be spent on anything besides lawyers’ fees and administrative expenses.

Dr. Rahul Gupta, former director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and an expert witness in several of the lawsuits against opioid companies, said these dollars should be an opportunity to prevent more suffering after the defendant companies’ business models led to an unprecedented number of drug deaths.
He said Mississippi’s local spending reminded him of how states used money from the 1990s tobacco lawsuits — for purposes other than ending a public health catastrophe.
“We should have learned a lot from our tobacco settlement funds,” Gupta said. “It’s disheartening and disappointing to see that.”
‘There was just nothing’
In 2022, when Tricia Christensen established the Appalachian Opioid Remediation project, she created a database to track how 13 states in the region spent their opioid settlement dollars. For the next two years, she led a team that pored through Google alerts, media reports and local public meetings in those states, including Mississippi.
She and her team found opioid settlement spending information in every state, except one.
“In Mississippi, there was just nothing,” said Christensen, now a consultant who advises states on how to spend opioid settlement money. “It was like a black box.”
While a few local governments provided Mississippi Today with spending resolutions passed by city and county officials, most appear to be spending their dollars without any public announcement. Many officials didn’t produce any internal documents that detailed how they were using their money and instead emailed the newsroom a few sentences that outlined their expenses.
Officials with McComb and Charleston said they didn’t know how much opioid settlement money they’d received – despite the fact they were already spending it. Mississippi Today referred clerks for the cities to the management firm in charge of distributing national opioid settlement money so they could determine how much their governments had secured.
When they provided the newsroom with that information and their spending, the records showed each had already spent a large amount of their dollars. McComb used $106,500 of its roughly $151,000 for new police cars, and Charleston had used the roughly $1,000 it received for payroll expenses and police supplies.
Dr. Judith Feinberg, a West Virginia University behavioral medicine and psychiatry professor, helped write a set of best practice guidelines for how states can use these dollars to prevent more overdose deaths. She said she believes state officials who don’t require or even encourage public reporting of opioid settlement spending are prioritizing politics over public health.

“If no one writes anything down, then there’s nothing to investigate,” she said.
Not every government provided Mississippi Today with all the requested information. Officials for Rankin County, which is expected to get the third largest amount of opioid settlement money of any local government, provided Mississippi Today with checks they’ve received but no documents that detail how they’ve been spending nearly $510,000. 
In county attorney Craig Slay’s response, he included a copy of Fitch’s contract with local governments. The sentence that says counties can spend opioid dollars on anything they deem appropriate was highlighted.
Slay did not respond to calls and emails from Mississippi Today about the spending, and he didn’t engage with a reporter for the newsroom at a Rankin County Board of Supervisors meeting in August when he was asked how these dollars were spent. 
“The fact that no one has to report is tragic because you don’t know what the money was spent for,” Feinberg said. “And there’s no accounting. That’s really crazy.”
Thinking about the larger picture
Mississippi’s local governments are expected to accept at least $48 million more in opioid settlement funds over the next 15 years.  
Dr. Cathy Slemp led the West Virginia health department as the state battled the country’s deadliest overdose crisis in the late 2010s. She said the unspent dollars could be an opportunity for local elected officials to begin developing the treatment and recovery resources needed to stop more Mississippi drug deaths.
It’s easy to understand why local governments might want to use the funds to plug budget holes, she said. But she cautioned whether that would be the wisest decision, as many Mississippians struggling with opioid addiction still don’t have access to effective treatment. 
“We can continue to just fill holes, or we can think about it in the larger picture,” she said.
Melody Worsham, a peer support specialist for the Mississippi Recovery Advocacy Project, said she’s hopeful this money can eventually find its ways to groups like hers — organizations that rely on the expertise of those who’ve dealt with addiction and can share which strategies may reach others in similar situations.
But she said the management of the opioid settlement funds mirrors a concerning pattern of how officials in Mississippi spend public dollars. 
“When they get the money, the state figures out, the governments figure out how to spend that money as quietly as possible.”
Editor’s note: Mississippi Today sent almost all of its public records requests in mid-June. Local governments responded on dates that ranged from the same day we sent the request to early September. The settlement administrators sent some payments out throughout July, and governments that wrote back to the newsroom in June have likely received more money since then. We’ve noted the date of when we received the information in our database. Additionally, some towns, cities and counties may have used money or formalized spending plans since they responded. 
When governments provided totals with and without interest, Mississippi Today used the total without interest, as more governments responded in that format. Some checks originally earmarked for towns and cities, especially those set to receive relatively little opioid settlement money, were reallocated to their counties. Because of that, the total these governments expect to get may differ slightly from what they will get.

This has not been good for Missouri. But it has worked out for the former AGs who have successfully used the office to get the hell out of Missouri and into federal office without having to pretend to do the work of being attorney general for too long (It’s a four year term, but we’ve had four in six years). 
When I wrote about the hateful and wasteful anti-diversity crusade of former-as-of-last-week Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, I wondered if I wasn’t whitewashing his efforts by avoiding using the more apt synonym for “anti-diversity,” which is “white supremacist.”
When U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley gave a speech last year in which he proudly proclaimed to be a “Christian Nationalist,” I thought the white supremacist dogwhistles couldn’t get any louder.
But Missouri’s junior senator and second most recent AG-for-a-minute, Eric Schmitt, yeeted the dogwhistles in a speech telling us exactly what he and the MAGA movement he has pledged allegiance to stand for: rewriting history to justify the dominance of white, purportedly Christian men.
Schmitt’s speech at the National Conservatism Conference followed one speaker who argued at length that America’s biggest problem is white guilt and another who insisted the U.S. is in a crisis that can only be resolved by becoming a Christian nation. 
Schmitt went full blood and soil. 
In the speech, titled “What Is an American,” he proclaimed that America is not “a proposition” or a shared set of values, rather it is a country for white people descended from European settlers, whose accomplishments should not be diminished by acknowledging the people that some of them enslaved, the Native Americans they killed, or anyone else denied equal rights at the founding.  
Real Americans, in his view, can trace their ancestry to settlers. He frames his German ancestors as real Americans. He doesn’t call them “immigrants,” of course, instead contrasting them with other immigrants, Native Americans, and the enslaved people who long pre-dated his ancestors’ arrival. That requires either astounding ignorance or deliberate obfuscation of the fact that neither Germans nor Catholics were initially considered white or American.
Schmitt dismissed Americans’ outrage at the death of George Floyd and valorized Confederate generals.
Schmitt mocked the idea that “a poem on the Statute of Liberty” or “five words in the Declaration of Independence” define who is an American. 
The five words he finds overemphasized and a tool of the woke: “all men are created equal.” 
I kid you not. Read the speech.
Schmitt is peddling a perverse and revisionist originalism in which only the founders who won the debates of the time matter. He calls us back to when the Constitution was first signed — when it counted enslaved people as 3/5ths of a person to appease slaveowners. 
He is rejecting the Constitution that the people of the U.S. amended with the 14th, 15th and 19th Amendments to include those of us who are not male or white.
Schmitt made repeated allusions to the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory. This is the increasingly widespread conspiracy theory that Jews are bringing non-white people into this country to replace its rightful white owners. That’s what the “good people on both sides” as Trump put it, who chanted “Jews will not replace us!” in Charlottesville were referring to. 
Schmitt hired a staffer who was fired by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign for making a video containing Neo-Nazi imagery and has too many ties to white supremacists for me to detail here. 
Schmitt’s proposition that certain people are entitled to rule based on ancestry or power, rather than required to convince voters of varying backgrounds to vote for them, is not just a horrifying thing to say outloud. It’s an ideology that underlies so many real world illegal power grabs — from Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election to Governor Mike Kehoe and Republican legislators’ effort to redistrict away Kansas City area citizens’ voting power. 
Nevertheless, I take solace in the fact that — though truly horrific words came out of the mouth of our sitting senator — the video shows his speech was sparsely attended and everyone looked bored. 
There are more of us than there are of them. Schmitt can try to rewrite our history and claim this country isn’t “based on a proposition,” but Lincoln was right. This nation was “conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/candidatefilingday02222022000006-scaled-e1757792868662-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-15 06:57:03.965662

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Iowa congressional candidates took time Saturday at the Polk County Democrats’ Steak Fry to condemn political violence in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killing in Utah.
Van Hollen, gave a keynote address at event, an annual Iowa fundraiser that featured speeches from Democratic candidates for Iowa’s U.S. Senate race, as well as from the 3rd and 4th congressional district races. He spoke about Kirk’s death, saying the shooting is a reminder of “how fragile our democracy can feel,” while criticizing Trump’s response to the issue.
On Wednesday, Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot while answering a question at an event at Utah Valley University. The suspected gunman was identified and taken into custody Friday.
Politicians and leaders mourned Kirk’s death and called for a change to prevent future politically motivated violence.
“The answer cannot be more violence,” Van Hollen said. “The answer cannot be vengeance. And sadly, the president is using this moment not to unite America against political violence, but to engage in finger pointing.
“But we will not be silenced. We will speak out for what we believe vigorously, courageously and peacefully,” he said.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said it has been a “really hard week” in light of Kirk’s death, and that Democrats, and all Americans, need to take steps to ensure these threats are eliminated.
“We don’t have to look very far to see other examples of violence that has occurred because of political leanings,” Hart said, in part referring to the fatal shooting of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman in June. “And none of us find that to be acceptable, because it simply isn’t.

“We live in a country that was founded on the principle that we could stand up in a place like this and express our feelings, our thoughts, our attitudes, our beliefs and our political leanings, and not get shot because we have an opinion or a thought that’s different than somebody else’s,” she said.
In Iowa, there has been an outpouring of sympathy for Kirk’s family and calls to stop political violence. Speaking with reporters, Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate called for an end to political violence.
In recent days, there has been some criticism from Republicans and others of Iowans, including some teachers, who have made controversial social media posts about Kirk’s death.
Democratic Senate candidate Jackie Norris, the school board president for the Des Moines Public Schools, said political violence was unacceptable, and that teachers — alongside most people — should be more cognizant of what they are publicly posting on social media. However, Norris added, “we have to respect that people have different views,” including teachers.
“It is important that we tone down the rhetoric, but we also have to respect that (teachers) have strong feelings too,” Norris said. “It’s a balance.”
Van Hollen calls Democrats ‘spineless’ for not backing Mamdani
Van Hollen also told Iowans at the event that winning in 2026 will mean Democrats must be outspokenly in support of Democratic candidates running in 2025 races — including New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.
The Maryland Democrat said Iowa would play an important role in the 2026 midterms — but that supporting Democrats in 2025 races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as for New York City mayor, will help build “momentum” for 2026.
Van Hollen criticized New York Democrats for not supporting Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America who won the Democratic mayoral primary. He said many Democrats representing New York in the U.S. House and Senate have “stayed on the sidelines” as President Donald Trump and others have mobilized to defeat the Democratic candidate.
“That kind of spineless politics is what people are sick of,” Van Hollen said. “They need to get behind him and get behind him now.”
Van Hollen criticized other aspects of the Democratic Party, saying the Biden administration was “feckless” in holding the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accountable to U.S. and international law. But he largely focused his remarks on Trump and Republicans in control of Congress.
Maryland leaders denounce political violence in the wake of Charlie Kirk killing

In addition to talking about Medicaid cuts and criticizing Trump’s foreign policy decisions, Van Hollen said the Trump administration was violating people’s constitutional rights by pursuing mass deportations. Van Hollen gained a significant national platform earlier in 2025 for his work involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador erroneously and held in prison there before being returned to the U.S. He is currently being held in Virginia by immigration authorities.
Van Hollen was one of the major advocates for returning Abrego Garcia to this country and allowing his case to go through the U.S. court system. At Saturday’s event, he said he was advised not to pursue the issue, as immigration is not a winning topic for Democrats, but said he continued to fight for Abrego Garcia’s due process rights because “our democracy cannot survive on silence or equivocation.”
“And lo and behold, Americans across the political spectrum do believe in the red, white and blue essential right to due process in the United States of America,” he said. “They do believe in the principle that no one in America — I mean, no one — should be disappeared by the state without having a chance before a court of law.
“And Americans understand this is not about one man,” Van Hollen said. “It’s about all of us. Because when you strip away the rights from one person, you threaten the rights … of all of us.”
Abrego Garcia has been returned to the U.S., though the Trump administration has said it intends to deport him again, potentially to the country of Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland.
Van Hollen said he would “never, ever apologize for standing up for anybody’s constitutional rights,” and said Democrats need to do more to speak out on issues they believe are important, even if polls or pundits say the topics are not politically advantageous. This will be especially important in states like Iowa, he said.
“We can and we will win here again, if — if — we speak to our core values, if we show people what we will stand up for and we will fight for,” Van Hollen said. “That’s why it’s great to be here to flip steaks and flip seats.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)On a sunny Friday afternoon, a half-dozen lawmakers and at least as many passenger rail advocates boarded an Amtrak train in Columbus, Wisconsin, for a 90-minute ride across the countryside.
Their destination was Tomah, where they spent another 90 minutes talking about why Wisconsin should expand train service and how to make that happen.
The event was a debut of sorts for the state Legislature’s Passenger Rail Caucus, a body that began coming together this year.
State Rep. Lori Palmeri
There are many reasons to expand passenger rail service in Wisconsin, according to Rep. Lori Palmeri (D-Oshkosh), a principal organizer for the group.
She sees economic and environmental benefits to rail travel — moving more people with less pollution per individual. But it also provides options for people no longer interested in driving but who don’t want to be stuck at home.
Rail service can address “the spatial mismatch between where people are living and where people are either working or going to school or getting their health care or recreating,” Palmeri said in an interview. “When I talk to seniors, they want to have that access to not just urban centers, but some of our second-class cities, too.”
An adult granddaughter of hers has epilepsy and will never be able to drive, Palmeri said, but others in that age group appear to drive less for other reasons.
“Fewer and fewer younger people are investing either in the learning piece” — driver training — “or the financial piece of car ownership,” she said, especially as cars get more expensive to own.
In short, for lawmakers in the passenger rail caucus and for the advocates encouraging them, passenger rail service is more than a nostalgic indulgence. It’s an underappreciated alternative to cramped airliners and congested highways.
‘Our time to stand up’
And it’s an alternative that Susan Foote-Martin, vice president of communications for the Wisconsin Association of Railroad Passengers, says will require a concerted campaign to gain more attention and support.
“We feel now is our time to stand up, and to speak up, and to ante up for the things that mean something to us,” Foote-Martin told the lawmakers and other advocates gathered in a Tomah restaurant’s banquet room.
“If we don’t do it, it’s not going to happen,” she said. “We can’t wait for a posse to come riding out of the sunset to save us. We are the posse.”
The caucus is building up steam while the view ahead is murky.
Amtrak’s Borealis train, which makes round trips once a day from Chicago to the Twin Cities through southern and western Wisconsin, has lived up to early projections, transporting nearly 230,000 riders in the first year of  its launch in May 2024.
Meanwhile, a  bus service connecting the Amtrak station in  Milwaukee to Green Bay through the Fox Valley will end abruptly Oct. 1. The service was funded through the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT), but money to continue the route was left out of the 2025-27 state budget.
“We’re working with WisDOT to do more, but to do more takes funding,” Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari told the assembled group. “And if there’s a way to put that back together again or find funding for it, we’re at WisDOT’s disposal and yours to go hunt that down.”
The bus service offered, in effect, proof of concept for a long desired  revival of passenger rail service to Green Bay. That proposed extension is the farthest along in development and planning of various Amtrak extension proposals in Wisconsin, according to Larry Rueff, who represents NEWRails, a nonprofit formed to promote the Green Bay extension. (The first three letters in the name stand for Northeast Wisconsin.)
The line is ready for the next phase in planning. “We need to know that it’s going to be funded, or it won’t get any further — and that’s going to be bad for Green Bay and bad for the rest of the state’s projects,” Rueff said in an interview.
High-speed memories
There’s no shortage of other ideas. Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said he’d like to see passenger service into Beloit some day. Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point) would like to see service connecting Stevens Point and other central Wisconsin communities to the Twin Cities through the Chippewa Valley.
“I just want to see passenger rail as being a viable alternative to everyone having to have a car right now,” Miresse told the Wisconsin Examiner. “I think people would like the opportunity to travel to Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison and be able to hop on a train and not have the burden of having a vehicle.”
The choice of Tomah for Friday’s discussion harkened back to the high-speed rail project approved during former Gov. Jim Doyle’s second term. After Scott Walker was elected governor in 2010 promising to cancel the project, Doyle killed it just before leaving office at the end of that year.
The project’s demise also put off plans to put a passenger stop in Madison. Columbus, the nearest Amtrak station, is 27 miles northeast of the capital city.
“As someone who works in Madison almost every week, it was a great disappointment to lose that high speed rail option,” Rep. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse), who also came to the Tomah meeting, said in an interview. “There are times when I’m driving to Madison and I think, ‘I could be on a train working right now.’”
Tomah had begun planning an intermodal hub as part of the high speed rail project. While that plan died, Tomah City Administrator Nick Morales told the group the city has seen bustling tourism and regularly draws in traffic to the region’s two military bases and a veterans hospital.
“We struggle with a lot of our transportation needs, and increased rail services to Tomah would greatly benefit us,” he said.
Getting Republicans on board
The lawmakers and advocates who gathered in Tomah contend that expanding rail service in Wisconsin should be a bipartisan objective, but only Democratic legislators were on hand for Friday’s event.
The late Republican Rep. Ed Brooks is reported to have proposed a railroad caucus years ago. “This was a dream of his,” Billings told the group, recalling fondly how she got to know Brooks early in her Assembly career.
Palmeri said she has reached out to several GOP lawmakers, some of whom have put their names on railroad-related bills in the past. “The hope was that we would have folks on the other side of the aisle also join us and hear the same information,” she said after the session was over Friday.
The canceled bus connection to Green Bay was among the casualties when the Republican majority on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee  removed $15 million for passenger rail service from Gov. Tony Evers’ draft budget.
The new passenger rail caucus is working on a bill that would make up for what was lost. There isn’t yet a draft, but Palmeri doesn’t expect it simply to be a rewrite of the Evers proposal.
“No disrespect to what was put in the budget, but I think there are some folks who are interested in going big or going home,” she said.  
Such legislation is unlikely to advance without support from Republicans, however. Asked what it would take to persuade GOP lawmakers to take it up, Palmeri answered, “them not being in the majority.”
So does that mean the developing legislation is intended for Democratic campaign messaging in the 2026 legislative elections?
“To a certain extent,” Palmeri said. “But I do also have the belief — maybe somewhat naïve — that there are people on the other side of the aisle who know this is good for their districts and who know that this could be their future — right?”

Two fatalities this year in such chambers have brought attention to hyperbaric oxygen therapy, including efforts to beef up state regulation. (Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images) Just before 8 a.m. on Jan. 31, an explosion rocked a nondescript one-story office building in an affluent suburb of Detroit.
The building was home to The Oxford Center, a health clinic that provided hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat a variety of disorders.
Inside the clinic, a spark had ignited the high-pressure, pure-oxygen atmosphere in a hyperbaric chamber where 5-year-old Thomas Cooper lay with a pillow and blanket, receiving treatment for ADHD and sleep apnea. A fireball consumed the inside of the chamber in seconds, killing the boy, law enforcement later said.
His mother suffered third-degree burns on her arms as she tried to free her son.
Within weeks of the tragedy, Michigan Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel charged three Oxford Center employees, including the center’s owner, with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and a fourth employee with involuntary manslaughter. Nessel said the staff disregarded multiple safety protocols.
The Michigan death and another fatality less than six months later at a wellness clinic in Arizona have thrown a spotlight on the largely unregulated world of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. A treatment once primarily confined to hospitals, it has surged in popularity in alternative health spaces in recent years.
About 1,200 hyperbaric medicine programs operate in the United States, according to estimates from the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, a nonprofit organization recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an accrediting body for hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Of those, 140 are accredited by the organization.
While nearly a dozen states require hyperbaric oxygen chambers to comply with certain safety standards, no states have comprehensive requirements specifically for accreditation or inspection of HBOT facilities.
Wellness clinics, sometimes without physician supervision, use the pressurized chambers for off-label treatments — those not approved by the FDA.
Before the explosion that killed Thomas Cooper, Michigan state Sen. Stephanie Chang had never heard of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The Oxford Center is located in her district, just a block from where she takes her daughter for tutoring, she said.
Chang, a Democrat, was aghast when she learned the state doesn’t accredit or regularly inspect clinics that offer the therapy. It doesn’t even track where such clinics operate.
“I think many people in the community felt the same way,” she said. “This is happening in our community without any regulation? We’ve got to do something.”
MAHA fans
Earlier this year, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited wellness podcaster Gary Brecka at his home, where they hung out in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber before taping an episode of Brecka’s show.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has found a support network inside Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement, among wellness influencers and anti-aging gurus. Podcasters including Brecka and Joe Rogan have touted the benefits of the chambers, while a hyperbaric chamber manufacturer had a presence at this year’s MAHA Spring Gala in Florida.
Before Trump’s reelection, Kennedy said in a social media post that the “FDA’s war on public health” was about to end, and he criticized its “aggressive suppression” of alternative health treatments, including hyperbaric therapy.
State lawmakers embrace RFK Jr.’s health policies

In hyperbaric oxygen therapy, also known as HBOT, patients rest inside a special chamber where they breathe pure oxygen. The air pressure in the chamber is raised to a level higher than normal to help increase the amount of oxygen in the blood to in turn accelerate healing.
Modern HBOT has been used for decades and is approved by the FDA to treat more than a dozen conditions, including burns, carbon monoxide poisoning and non-healing diabetic wounds.
Last month, in the wake of the Michigan and Arizona deaths, the FDA issued recommendations for HBOT providers and facilities to help reduce safety risks.
But as the wellness industry has ballooned, HBOT has seen “an exponential increase” in nonmedical providers, said John Peters, executive director at the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society.
Wellness clinics like The Oxford Center in Michigan advertise that HBOT can treat a multitude of conditions off-label, from cancer and HIV to dementia and autism. Scientific research has been inconclusive. For example, some studies have shown benefits for children with autism, while others have found insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment.
Peters believes much of the off-label claims are exaggerated.
“There are people with discretionary income willing to spend it on these sales pitches,” said Peters. “What’s more sad than that are the people who are vulnerable. These are individuals who have sick family members or are sick themselves and they’re grasping at straws, looking for any relief. And they are tricked by these carpetbaggers.”
Most insurance plans will cover HBOT for FDA-approved uses, including the treatment of burns or carbon monoxide poisoning. Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare — the health insurance for active-duty and retired members of the military — also have a short list of approved conditions. For everything else, it’s cash-only.
And HBOT typically isn’t a one-and-done treatment. It can cost $200 or more per treatment session, with dozens of sessions recommended. Thomas Cooper had been on his 36th of 40 treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and sleep apnea, the Detroit Free Press reported. The FDA has not approved HBOT for either condition.
Unaccredited clinics like The Oxford Center are “making a lot of money and they have no one overseeing them,” said Michigan Democratic state Rep. Sharon MacDonell, who also represents the district where The Oxford Center was located and is working with Chang on a bill to regulate HBOT.
“No health insurance company is asking for documentation, no system is checking in. No state has figured out a way to do this, so we’re trying really hard.”
States in the dark
Deaths in hyperbaric chambers are rare, but the Michigan incident was one of two fatalities this year: In July, Walter Foxcroft, a 43-year-old physical therapist, was killed in an apparent flash fire in a hyperbaric chamber at his wellness clinic in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, according to municipal officials. First responders found him dead inside an intact chamber that appeared to have been on fire.
There have been other deaths and injuries over the past two decades.
In 2009, a 4-year-old boy and his 62-year-old grandmother died in a fire when a chamber exploded at a Florida clinic. That clinic, like the ones in Michigan and Arizona, was not accredited.
In 2023, a hyperbaric oxygen chamber exploded at a wellness spa in Utah, seriously injuring the two people inside, according to local fire officials. And in 2012, a hyperbaric chamber at a veterinary center in Florida exploded, killing the horse inside and a woman who had been operating the unit.
Nearly a dozen states require hyperbaric oxygen chambers to comply with certain safety standards for pressure vessels laid out by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
But Peters, with the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, said a large number of hyperbaric chambers imported from countries such as China and Poland that don’t meet those standards. He said experts believe there could be 20,000 noncode compliant chambers operating in the United States.










The FDA guidance does nothing to curb the proliferation of noncode compliant chambers into the country and the use of those chambers.


– John Peters, executive director at the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society


That’s one reason he believes the recent FDA guidance for safe use of the chambers rings hollow.
“The FDA guidance does nothing to curb the proliferation of noncode compliant chambers into the country and the use of those chambers,” he said. “It does nothing to address the secondary market. You can buy a hyperbaric chamber and sell it to another individual without any requirement.”
Access vs. safety
Chang and MacDonell say they want to require accreditation for hyperbaric chambers and for the clinics that offer the therapy, including requiring a physician or other medical provider to oversee treatment.
But some people, including some autism advocates, have expressed concern that overregulation could hurt access to HBOT for families that want it.
“I think these folks recognize they want to keep access but don’t want people getting taken advantage of by bad actors in this space, and want to ensure they’re going to a facility that’s doing things the right way,” Chang said.
Chang said the bill would not regulate a newer, more portable type of hyperbaric chamber that are popular in wellness circles and sometimes used in homes. They have soft outer shells and seal with a zipper, unlike traditional steel-cased chambers. The soft-side chambers provide so-called mild hyperbaric oxygen therapy at lower pressure and aren’t considered medical devices like hard-shell chambers. But in North Carolina, state fire marshals have shut down the use of such devices at wellness clinics over safety concerns.
Fire officials in other states, including Utah, have also expressed concerns over the soft-side chambers.
In a first for states, Texas might put MAHA warning labels on snack foods

In recent years, veterans groups have pushed for HBOT to be available and covered for treating traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. Thirteen states have passed legislation to require or support such treatments for veterans, according to Eric Koleda, national director of state legislative efforts for TreatNOW, a coalition that promotes HBOT access for veterans.
Koleda said he’s glad the Michigan lawmakers are working on the issue, though he’s not convinced stricter regulation is needed.
“We’re not proposing that there needs to be an enormous amount of regulation because there are already safety standards in place, and if they’re adhered to, that ensures a safe level of operation,” he said. “This is treatment that’s already done safely every day.”
In July, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe signed a bill into law establishing a fund to pay for HBOT for veterans with a traumatic brain injury or PTSD. The bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the legislature.
Veteran-related HBOT bills have also been introduced this year in Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York and Oregon. Koleda said his organization is also working to get the FDA and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to add traumatic brain injury and PTSD to the list of conditions approved for HBOT treatment.
Indiana state Sen. David Niezgodski, a Democrat, introduced a resolution in April urging the state’s legislative council to study regulation of HBOT. The deaths in Michigan and Arizona caught his eye, he said, because Indiana has a law promoting the treatment for veterans. The resolution passed but wasn’t taken up by the council.
“I am 100% for trying to do everything we can to get this treatment where those who need it are truly able to benefit from it,” he told Stateline. “Though I want to be certain that we do everything we can to make sure that when they receive that treatment, it’s going to be safe at all times.”
The Michigan lawmakers stress their bill doesn’t restrict HBOT’s off-label use and they’re continuing to work with stakeholders. They hope to get it filed before the end of the year.
“When you go into what you believe to be a medical facility, you assume it is being regulated and that it is licensed and that the people running this complex technology know what they’re doing,” said MacDonell. “That’s our goal.”

Sylvia Ortiz-Velez secured Republican support for her resolution and, unlike the Hispanic Caucus, was able to get a scheduled floor vote. Ortiz-Velez speaks at a press conference in January. Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Monday marks the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, and this year’s celebration could be the first time that the Wisconsin Legislature officially recognizes the month. 
Assembly Joint Resolution 83 recognizes that Hispanic Heritage Month runs from Sept. 15 through Oct. 15 and that it presents an opportunity to honor the contributions of Hispanics and Latinos to the “past, present and future” of Wisconsin and the country. The month starts halfway through September because Sept. 15 marks the anniversary of independence from Spanish rule for  several Central American countries, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
The Assembly unanimously passed the resolution authored by Milwaukee Democrat Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez, though its journey to the floor was marred by a public dispute among Democratic lawmakers. Black History Month resolutions have also stirred controversy in the past and for many years faced roadblocks to passage. This year the Black History Month resolution passed smoothly. 
Ortiz-Velez authored her resolution after she was not included as an author on a similar effort  by members of the Hispanic Legislative Caucus. Ortiz-Velez had declined to join the newly formed caucus, and its members explained that the authors of their resolution were exclusively  caucus members. 
Ortiz-Velez’s resolution differed from the caucus version in that it doesn’t honor the work of any specific individuals. 
Ortiz-Velez secured Republican support for her resolution and, unlike the Hispanic Caucus, was able to get a scheduled floor vote.
Ortiz-Velez said on the floor that in writing her resolution she “wanted to make sure that I focused on the values that bind us together, so everyone can feel that they were included and had a seat at the table.” She noted in her speech that Hispanic and Latino people make up 7.8% of the state’s population — the largest minority group in Wisconsin. 
“Across the state, Hispanic and Latino families are helping revitalize small towns and urban neighborhoods by opening businesses and buying homes and restoring vacant properties, supporting local schools and churches,” Ortiz-Velez said. “Hispanic and Latino Wisconsinites share the same core values… faith, family, hard work and service to community and country.”
The resolution states that Hispanic and Latino people settled in the area before Wisconsin achieved statehood in 1848 and that the 20th century was a time when Central and South Americans increasingly migrated to Wisconsin for work, becoming a “vital part of Wisconsin’s agricultural economy.”
“Wisconsin has become home to more than 450,000 Hispanics and Latinos, who represent one of the fastest-growing demographic groups in the state,” the resolution states. “Hispanics and Latinos live and work all across the state, enriching and revitalizing rural and urban communities alike.” 
It also recognizes that Hispanic and Latino residents have served as elected officials and “have risked their lives to defend the United States in every armed conflict in modern history.” 
Several lawmakers spoke in favor of the resolution ahead of the unanimous vote last week, including Rep. Priscilla Prado (D-Milwaukee), the leader of the Hispanic Legislative Caucus. 
Prado said the resolution was a “long overdue acknowledgment of the meaningful contributions that Hispanic communities have made to our great state.” 
“Unity is possible, even if we disagree on other issues, and at a time when division can feel ever so present, this resolution promises to lean into our shared humanity. It is not about winners or losers. It’s about the community I represent, and that I identify with,” Prado said. “Today, let’s pass this resolution, not just as a formality, but with excitement and heartfelt recognition to our Hispanic communities and their contribution to our great state.” 
Ortiz-Velez said in a statement that if the resolution passes the Senate, it will be the first time a joint resolution recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month will have ever passed the full Legislature. 
The resolution also has bipartisan support in the Senate with Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) as the leading coauthor. The Senate does not have a scheduled floor session during September.

Four initiatives among federal agencies and in Congress would harm the Western landscape that’s owned by all Americans, conservationists contend.
The post After national parks hearing, MAGA forces continue public land assault, greens say appeared first on WyoFile .","As Congress conducted a high-profile hearing in Grand Teton National Park 10 days ago to support parks funding, President Donald Trump’s administration and supporters were busy elsewhere eliminating public land protections across the West.
The Grand Teton hearing conducted by the House Committee on Natural Resources on Sept. 5 heard widespread support for resolving a backlog of maintenance at national parks, along with calls to restore DOGE staffing cuts.
But the committee meeting at the spectacular Jenny Lake Plaza came amidst a flurry of attacks against rules protecting wildlife, its habitat and preservation funds, conservationists said.
Those attacks include Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ move to rescind the Forest Service roadless rule that protects 59 million roadless acres considered vital to wildlife. Also, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order restricting use of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was created in 1964 to buy and preserve recreation lands.
“The administration is saying that public [BLM] lands should be managed primarily for the good of powerful drilling, mining and development interests.” Alison Flint
Meantime, the U.S. House on Sept. 3 put on the chopping block a Bureau of Land Management plan in Montana that restricted coal leasing. If agreed to by the Senate, the bill would open the door to “legal and regulatory chaos” across the West, the Center for Western Priorities warned.
And on Thursday, the BLM opened comment on the plan to roll back its Public Lands Rule that gave conservation an equal footing with industrial uses of property owned by all Americans.
All that happened in 15 days — about one week on either side of the congressional Teton hearing. But while witnesses were supporting parks in the open air of the Teton Mountains, Trump allies were undercutting conservation with less visible methods, one public lands advocate said.
The rule changes, secretarial orders and legislation are complex and sometimes opaque, said Amy Lindholm, an Appalachian Mountain Club director and spokesperson for the Land and Water Conservation Fund Coalition.
“It’s not easy to understand what’s going on here,” she said, using Burgum’s order curtailing the LWCF as an example. “It flies under the radar [but] could be as serious as selling off pieces of federal public land.”
The MAGA messages
The administration and its supporters characterized the changes as necessary to help reduce the federal deficit, rectify allegedly unlawful policies and increase energy production, among other things.
“I am so baffled and mortified that for four years our government intentionally tried to impose energy poverty on the American people, all to please the vocal but minority climate lobby,” U.S. Rep Harriet Hageman said on the House floor when voting Sept. 3 for Joint House Resolution 104.
That bill states that the BLM’s Montana management plan restricting coal leasing in the Powder River Basin “shall have no force or effect.”

Hageman’s vote was one of three in the 211-208 tally that helped Republicans use the Congressional Review Act to move the bill through the House.
On another front, Agriculture Secretary Rollins’ roadless-rule rollback will allow loggers “to access our abundant timer [sic] resources,” U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis wrote to a constituent on Sept. 2. The roadless rule “has done nothing to advance our national interest or strengthen our communities,” Lummis wrote.
The rollback “will give state and local leaders, not distant federal agencies, the authority to manage forests responsibly, improve forest health, and implement real wildfire prevention strategies,” Lummis’ letter reads. “I will push back on any policies that endangers [sic] Wyoming families, communities or businesses.”  
In ordering revisions to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, Interior Secretary Burgum wrote that changes will ensure funds “are managed efficiently and aligned with the goals of the Trump administration.” The account was used to buy and protect the 640-acre Kelly Parcel in Grand Teton National Park. While touting the revisions, Burgum said the Trump administration has “prioritized access to Federal lands and outdoor recreation.”
At the BLM, meanwhile, conservation should not be on equal footing with mining, drilling and grazing, according to a notice seeking public comment on the expurgation of the Public Lands Rule. Also known as the Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, the measure is “unnecessary and violates existing statutory requirements,” the notice reads.
Conservation doesn’t rise to a “principal or major use” of BLM land, the Western Energy Alliance said in a statement supporting rollback of the Public Lands Rule. Those principal uses are “mineral exploration and production, livestock grazing, rights‐of‐way, fish and wildlife development, recreation, and timber,” the statement said.
Greens see an assault
Conservationists and others are challenging those MAGA positions. Using the Congressional Review Act to undo the BLM’s Montana plan for the Powder River Basin coal — a move Hageman voted for — risks unleashing “legal and regulatory chaos across the West,” the Center for Western Priorities said.
“If courts interpret this action broadly, every management plan written since 1996 could be challenged in court — potentially invalidating oil and gas leases, grazing permits, and threatening public access to trails and campgrounds,” the Center’s Deputy Director Aaron Weiss said in a statement.
Without BLM resource management plans, operations would revert to “outdated frameworks … written before today’s recreation economy took off,” he said. “Outfitters, guides and businesses that depend on reliable access for rafting, off-roading, and other outdoor activities could face years of uncertainty, permit delays, and costly litigation.”

On the roadless front, Lummis’ contention that roads can help prevent wildfires contradicts a 2007 study that found “current road systems increase risk of human-caused fire.” Authored by the Pacific Biodiversity Institute, the 40-page paper found that “[a]reas that are very close to roads have many times more wildfire occurrences than areas distant from roads.”
Roadless areas are critical to outfitter Meredith Taylor, who has worked successfully in them for decades, she told WyoFile. Industrializing them could endanger her family, community and business, she suggested. 
“Unnecessary road development would ruin the value of these public lands for people and wildlife who appreciate them as they are,” Taylor said. The Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation and others urged the public to comment before Sept. 19.
Conservation should be equal
Conservationists also decried the pending revocation of the BLM’s Public Lands Rule/Conservation and Landscape Health Rule. “The administration is saying that public lands should be managed primarily for the good of powerful drilling, mining and development interests,” Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement.
“They’re saying that public lands’ role in providing Americans the freedom to enjoy the outdoors, and conserve beloved places … is a second-class consideration,” Flint said. The rule “has solid grounding in a nearly 50-year-old directive from Congress,” she said.
Defenders of Wildlife said the existing rule “requires science-based decision-making and consideration of conservation.” The rule is “foolishly being yanked away in service of the ‘Drill, baby, drill’ agenda,” Vera Smith, national forests and public lands director at Defenders, said in a statement.
Addressing changes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which receives $900 million a year from oil and gas leasing, LWCF Coalition spokesperson Lindholm warned of dangers in Burgum’s order.
“There’s a provision encouraging states to use their state grant dollars [from the federal fund] to buy surplus federal land,” she said. “We don’t want states to use the funds to buy back federal land that’s already been protected, to pay for continued access to places they already have access to,” she said.
Given Burgum’s advocacy for developing federal land for housing, the changes create “a dangerous potential pathway for the selloff of federal lands,” she said.
The agency already has a process for the sale of property that works, Lindholm said. Burgum’s order will reexamine that process “with the intent of increasing the discretion of the secretary.”
Without Burgum’s stated selloff advocacy, “it’s not something we would have necessarily red-flagged,” she said.
Soul of Wyoming
Healthy landscapes and wildlife are the soul of northwestern Wyoming, state Rep. Liz Storer, a Democrat from Jackson, said. Her district covers Grand Teton and parts of Yellowstone national parks, the National Elk Refuge, parts of the Bridger-Teton National Forest and BLM property.
Those lands and the wildlife on them “define who we are,” she said at a Keep Parks Public rally in Jackson on Sept. 4.
Others at the forum chimed in. “These threats to public lands are very much alive,” Lauren Bogard, senior director of advocacy at the Center for Western Priorities, said after outlining DOGE cuts and threats to conservation.EcoTour Adventures founder and wildlife guide Taylor Phillips told the Teton congressional panel that scientists are scared. “In the next five to 10 years, the wildlife as we see it now will not exist unless drastic measures are taken,” Phillips testified of his talks with scientists.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)After weeks of hype, it turns out the Oklahoma Department of Education’s new test that promises to weed out “woke” teachers doesn’t do any such thing.
In fact, it’s impossible to fail Superintendent Ryan Walters’ so-called “America First” test that he promises is “woke-proofing the classroom” and that he wants to require blue-state educators to take before they can teach here. 
It turns out you can get every answer wrong and still receive a “Certificate of Completion” certifying that you have “successfully completed the Teacher Qualification Test.” I know because I purposely set out to get every question wrong by picking the stupidest answers in the 34-question multiple choice exam developed in conjunction with PragerU, a self-described conservative nonprofit, that includes a mix of random history, culture and gender-related biology questions.
The test, which is available to anyone to take, requires you to keep guessing until you pick the correct answer. As a result, there’s no true measure of if someone is too “woke” to teach in our schools or even if they actually understand our nation’s history.
I had been looking forward to pitting myself against the test to get a better grasp about how Walters and PragerU actually define “woke.” Walters, after all, is encouraging schools to use PragerU’s videos as instructional materials in our schools.
So I was disappointed, though perhaps not entirely surprised, to discover after weeks of promises, this test amounts to the latest harebrained antic dreamed up by a headline-thirsty public official. 
The effort does little more than fearmonger against imaginary boogeyteachers who Walters seems to think want to consume Oklahoma children’s little souls with “liberal” lessons.
But this stunt is the biggest embarrassment yet for our Republican state superintendent, and that’s saying a lot given that he has proven time and again to be all show and little substance. He’s already created the do-nothing Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism and once tried to require a video of himself attacking the “radical left” be shown to children. 
I fear this latest effort will do little to help our state attract the quality teachers we desperately need and to bolster faith in the lessons being taught in our classrooms. We’re in the throes of a massive teacher shortage and have seen record numbers of emergency certified educators entering our classrooms. We’re behind the regional average in educator pay, and though Walters has implemented successful signing bonus programs aimed at helping recruit talented teachers, it hasn’t been enough to turn the tide.
Because it wasn’t the actual test questions themselves that were so insulting, though it is pretty bold to require an assessment that doesn’t actually do any assessing and to pass it off as a barometer to prove “your commitment to truth and integrity.”
What I found alarming was Walters’ seeming reckless disregard for protecting personal information. In order to take this dubious “assessment,” people are required to visit PragerU’s site and provide the California-based nonprofit with all sorts of personal information.
Why does PragerU need to know my mailing address, my phone number, my name, my email address and if I’m a parent or teacher in order to access this.
What’s next, a DNA sample?
And I also had to agree to give PragerU carte blanc permission to send me emails and “view, monitor and record” my activity on their site. And, they have wasted no time in spamming me with unwanted emails like a sandwich shop rewards program.
We’re supposed to be able to trust Walters to act in the best interest of our children, and I fail to see how shilling for PragerU does that.
What I also found outrageous was the bizarre, 16-minute video conversation that Walters recorded with PragerU’s CEO Marissa Streit that introduces the test. The CEO lets loose and says the people who are critical of her group “are the same people who don’t care about children,” and “people who have been able to hold schools and our children hostage to their political agenda.”
She also said their group and Walters have the “same enemies.”
Rather than pushing back on that “woke” indoctrination and insulting inflammatory rhetoric, Walters responds: “That’s exactly right.”
“We’re not going to continue to sit back and watch the teacher’s unions use schools to force a left-wing ideology on kids,” Walters also says in the video.
Talk about a political agenda.
Anyone who registers to complete the test receives a welcome email from PragerU containing this gem: “Alarmingly, many young Americans haven’t been exposed to clear, conservative perspectives. PragerU fills that void by offering fact-based content that simplifies complex issues and champions foundational values like freedom and personal responsibility.”
Not surprisingly “conservative” indoctrination is OK in Walters’ eyes.
As a parent, I don’t want any sort of indoctrination going on in my schools. 
And, to borrow one of Republicans’ favorite phrases, shouldn’t I have parental choice in terms of what my children are learning? Why would I want some random California nonprofit determining what’s right for my children or spouting hate about me – their mother – being an “enemy” simply because I’m a critic of PragerU’s efforts to oversimply our history and make fun of historically marginalized people? 
As a particularly revolting example, PragerU has a cartoon on their site that features two time traveling children who go back to 1493 to speak with Christopher Columbus. They’re on a mission to determine whether the U.S. should honor him with a holiday or if that day should honor the Indigenous people of the Americas who lived here when he arrived. When asked about slavery, Columbus justifies it by saying it’s as old as time, and that “being taken as a slave is better than being killed.”
Wow.
Does saying slavery is wrong make someone “woke”? I’m not sure. But teaching children that it’s a better option than death is callous. And immoral.
Walters said he’s fine with allowing his children to learn from PragerU videos, and that’s a choice he gets to make. He’s in a position of power, even if he’s using it irresponsibly. 
But if Walters truly embodies parental empowerment like he claims, he should not be associating in an official capacity with a group that is trying to assert their political beliefs in our schools.
Walters should be pushing back against all out-of-state actors, even conservative ones, who are trying to impose their views on our children. And he shouldn’t be allowing random groups to create “tests.” 
Let’s leave that to the education experts.

On paper, the Equality State appears to have good annual growth, but pockets of extreme wealth skew the numbers, writes columnist Khale Lenhart.
The post Wyoming’s economic issues are more urgent than we realize appeared first on WyoFile .","For years, Wyoming’s economic picture has been precarious, with major fluctuations in employment and productivity. However, we have reassured ourselves with the conventional wisdom that our “boom and bust” economy will soon have better days. Numbers have generally supported this view. Despite the obvious ups and downs, average incomes continued to rise and, at least based on statewide statistics, we had not yet reached a tipping point. Unfortunately, that perspective may be more flawed than we realize.

Opinion

When we evaluate Wyoming’s economy, we often lose sight of its most important component: its people. Wyoming is made up of people, not numbers on a profit-loss statement. High GDP is great, but if that productivity does not increase the well-being of the people doing the work, it is hollow. When we evaluate our economy’s performance, in addition to factors like average productivity and profitability, we should also look at numbers like personal incomes. Are Wyoming’s citizens keeping up with the rest of the nation? Based on the numbers in recent years, it appears we are not. 
I recently had a conversation with a friend involved in statistical analysis, specifically in the economic and business sectors. He pointed out that while Wyoming’s per capita income statistics appeared to show healthy growth, they were greatly skewed. The inclusion of Teton County and its many high-income residents in Wyoming’s statewide calculations paints a far rosier picture than truly exists. 
It is no surprise that Teton County outpaces the rest of Wyoming when it comes to personal incomes. Teton County is famously among the wealthiest counties in the country, and we all have heard the quips about Jackson’s wealth and the billionaires forcing out the millionaires. What is surprising is how Teton County has sharply differed from the rest of Wyoming in the years since the COVID pandemic. Looking at the 10 most recent years of data included in federal labor statistics, you can get a sense of how things have changed. In the early to mid-2010s, Teton County tended to do better than the rest of Wyoming when it came to income growth, with growth corresponding with the rest of the state. When the rest of the state’s income growth rate changed, Teton County’s tended to as well, and in the same direction. 
In 2019, however, we saw the beginning of a sharp divergence. Whereas the rest of Wyoming’s personal income was stagnant and slightly declining, Teton County began to see massive personal income growth. For example, using 2014 as a baseline, Wyoming outside of Teton County saw its average personal income decline by 4.7% by 2019. In contrast, Teton County saw its average personal income grow by 22.7%. Over the next several years, the rest of Wyoming’s income largely stagnated. It was not until 2023 that average personal incomes caught up with 2014 numbers, and even then, they were only 1.9% higher. Teton County, on the other hand, saw its average personal income skyrocket. Comparing 2014 to 2023, Teton County’s average income nearly doubled, increasing by 94.3%.
Due to Wyoming’s small population, this has major impacts on statewide statistics. When looking at statewide numbers, it appears that Wyoming had fairly healthy annual growth, with a 14.4% increase in incomes between 2014 and 2023. What really happened, however, was that Teton County saw incomes shoot up, while the rest of the state stalled. 
What does this mean? It means that our state policymakers must understand that things may be worse than they appear on paper. Questions about how we encourage quality, high-paying jobs and economic opportunities are likely more urgent than we think. If Wyoming fails to provide the sort of opportunity that can be found elsewhere, people will leave. It is as simple as that.
Unfortunately, we have already become used to this trend. Wyoming ranks last in retaining its young people, with the highest out-migration rate in the country. Census numbers also show that, despite a statewide population increase of around 3.3% between 2010 and 2020, almost every age demographic saw population losses in Wyoming, except the 65+ demographic, which saw an increase of over 48%. This is troubling, as it shows we are losing our productive-aged population. There is little doubt that the lack of economic opportunities plays a real role.
Our policymakers need to take this issue seriously. This goes beyond hoping that our legacy industries will continue to prop us up. They are an important part of our economy and need to be supported, but they cannot be the only part of our economy. Too often, we let discontent with change stifle progress. Either our economy will change, or we will continue to export our opportunity and our young people to the benefit of other states. I want my children to have the chance to get good paying, quality jobs here in Wyoming. If we do not take this issue seriously, they may not have the chance.

(Photo courtesy of Cindy Green's campaign)Virginia’s Democrats have touted the fact that they are running candidates in all 100 House of Delegates seats, but the party isn’t always putting its money where its mouth is, some candidates say. 
The Democratic National Committee, typically focused on D.C. politics, has expanded its efforts to boost parties at the state level. Chair Ken Martin announced earlier this year that the DNC would disburse $17,500 per month to Virginia’s state Democratic Party. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee recently pumped another $1.5 million into Virginia’s races, as part of a seven figure investment. 
“The role of political parties is to build infrastructure everywhere,” Martin said earlier this year.
But not every candidate running for Virginia’s House of Delegates this year has directly benefited so far.
A special fundraising page on Act Blue, a Democratic fundraising site, dubs the 27 Democratic candidates for House seats in Republican-leaning areas the “Virginia Value Pack” who are “punching well above their weight.” 
The Act Blue page’s goal is $70,000 that can be split between the candidates, for which about $60,000 has already been raised from individuals chipping in. 
Cindy Green, who is challenging Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, in House District 44, said it’s heartening to see support from voters.
She and the other 26 candidates also wrote a joint letter to incumbent Democratic delegates and senators asking for support. Some answered the call, like Sens. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, and Dels. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, and David Reid, D-Fairfax, Green said. 
First-time candidate Stacey Carroll, a military veteran and CPA in Northern Virginia, also donated $500, Green said. 
“She’s running just like the rest of us are,” Green said. “So that was very impressive.”
The shared resource from Carroll comes from a sizable coffer for a newcomer. Carroll is taking on Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, in Republican-leaning House District 64, which is eyed as one that Democrats could flip. DLCC, for instance, included Carroll in their latest round of candidate spotlights. 
Green said it’s “ironic” that Democratic leadership in Virginia touts having 100 candidates this year, while not financially backing all of them. 
She said she understands most resources should be directed at those in competitive or potentially flippable seats, but says a little bit would go a long way for candidates like herself. 
“A campaign like mine, it doesn’t take a lot of money to provide support,” Green said.
Her money goes toward brochures to hand out when door-knocking, yard signs, radio ads, and billboards. With a small campaign of volunteers who have full-time jobs like herself, she doesn’t have to worry about paying staff or consultants or large advertisement blitzes. 
“We’re scrappy,” Green said. “We know how to get stuff done.”
Green said that she and the 26 other Democrats running in Republican strongholds are doing it for a few reasons: to give voters choices, help build future party benches in the areas, and to support up-ballot votes for Abigail Spanberger, Ghazala Hashmi and Jay Jones as governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.
For Green, in particular, it’s also about making her opponent spend money in his district. 
“I’m trying to keep O’Quinn’s money in his district,” she said. “He’s a piggy bank for his party. That will continue as long as no one is challenging him.”
First elected in 2011, O’Quinn has yet to have a Democratic opponent and has only been challenged twice by a Republican who first ran as an independent.
He has since risen through the ranks in Republican leadership to the role of Deputy House Leader in the GOP caucus. Not having to run a serious campaign against challengers means his coffers have continued to grow. O’Quinn has donated nearly a million dollars in political contributions to other Republican candidates.
To ward off Green, he may not need to spend much money locally in places like Washington County and Bristol, but as she ramps up her ground game, he might feel compelled to. 
Though DPVA and the House Democratic Caucus have not directly supported the candidates in donations, caucus spokeswoman Amber Gantt said that Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, and DPVA Chair Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, have given money to Rural Ground Game, an organization supporting rural candidates.
Locally-rooted organizers are otherwise taking matters into their own hands. 
Rebecca Daly, chair of 9th Congressional District Democratic Committee, said she has done what she can to boost rural Democrats in deep Southwest Virginia. That included hosting candidate training for 13 of the 27 “Value Pack” Democrats within the district. 
She said that behind the scenes she has been “preaching” to the state party officials for years about investment in that side of the state. 
She doesn’t feel they’re always getting it, evidenced by receiving just 700 yard signs for Spanberger, Hashmi and Jones recently. With the 9th District being “about the size of the state of New Jersey” Daly said she has to sort out how to divide them up between over 20 local committees and a handful of Young Democrat committees. 
“The position has always been to take care of the crescent,” Daley said of Democratic strongholds in Northern and Central Virginia into Hampton Roads. 
Though the caucus and state party have invested predominantly in Virginia’s Democratic bases, candidates who proved themselves in the past with narrow losses are getting more investment this time. One of those is Lily Franklin in House District 41. Having narrowly lost to Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, in 2023, she now has nearly double his donations — over $350,00 of which comes from the caucus and DPVA. That’s a campaign war chest of about $540,000 to his roughly $248,000.
Green and Daly know most Democrats in rural or certain suburban areas aren’t likely to perform as well as Franklin has, but they imagine a day that could be different. 
“If we don’t build, we’re never going to win in other areas,” Daley said.

Shannon Building (Building One) on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda. (Photo by Lydia Polimeni/National Institutes of Health)A University of Maryland program that encourages undergraduate minority students to research communication sciences and disorders was making strides to help people learn and communicate better — until its grant, like 78 others in Maryland, was cut in May.
UMD-REACH —Research, Equity, and Access in Communication and Hearing — was one of the lucky 47 projects in the state that have seen their National Institutes of Health grant reinstated since the initial May cut by the Trump administration. But program officials said the delay came with a cost.
“We’re happy about the reinstatement, but at the same time, it’s taken a lot of time and work for a bunch of people who would rather be helping people learn things and helping people be healthier,” Matthew Goupell, a co-director of the UMD-REACH program, said.
While UMD-REACH is once again receiving funds from NIH following the July reinstatement, its research and student training has slowed down. The organization is among dozens in Maryland that have seen funding abruptly turned off and then reinstated, disrupting research and programs.
“We had to all spend a lot of time dealing with the uncertainty, and that just takes away from the ability to progress the science,” said Goupell. “It’s about a limitation on our time and our productivity for these slowdowns.”
UMD-REACH was told its grant was being terminated because NIH policy does not prioritize research programs as part of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, efforts, according to an email Goupell received from NIH.
U.S. Supreme Court gives go-ahead for Trump to cancel $783M in NIH research grants

This spring, President Donald Trump (R) and his administration terminated hundreds of science and research grants supported by the NIH, in an effort to drastically slash government spending and reduce federal support for initiatives that focus on DEI, LGBTQ+ issues and other underserved populations.
But in the following months, the administration has reversed its decisions on some grant terminations, while court rulings forced it to reinstate other grants, making the landscape of tracking whether the money is flowing to those research programs difficult.
“Funding terminations and delays are a significant obstacle for researchers at Johns Hopkins and other universities,” Johns Hopkins University said in a written statement. “The university will continue strongly advocating for our research mission, the benefits it provides to our community here in Baltimore, and the value of lifesaving discoveries for people all across the country.”
Grant Witness is an attempt to follow the changing landscape on NIH grants, by collecting firsthand testimony from researchers who no longer have access to funding and referencing official announcements from the Trump administration.
For Maryland, Grant Witness reports that a total of 79 grant programs were terminated throughout the year, affecting $67.5 million in funds.
The database says that 32 of those grants were still terminated as of September, freezing $16.5 million in research grants. The other 47 of those terminated programs may have been reinstated due to court proceedings or administration decision reversals – potentially freeing up about $51 million.
But some programs still face challenges even if NIH funding for those programs have been reinstated, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
“Some of these studies were in progress and had to come to a screeching halt,” he said, noting that some studies needed consistent updates that couldn’t be completed while funding was frozen. “Those experiments are ruined at that point.”
The American Public Health Association is currently in a legal battle challenging the grant terminations saying that the terminations were discriminatory in nature. Some of the suspended research grants were reinstated following APHA’s legal challenge to the NIH.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But even then, Benjamin said, the Trump administration has been slow-walking the grant funds for some of the programs that should be receiving funding again.
“Innovation is being stifled,” he said. “The administration is slow-walking a lot of them out the door.”
Johns Hopkins agrees, saying that “many federal agencies have significantly slowed the release of new research awards and the renewal of existing awards, leading to a sharp drop in federal research investment at Hopkins and other universities.”
“From late January through late May of this year, new research funding awards were down by nearly two-thirds as compared to the same period in 2024,” said the statement from Hopkins, one of the biggest losers of grant funding.
Benjamin said that the administration’s targeting of DEI research was “fundamentally being racist and discriminatory.”
“These programs are designed to address health inequity,” Georges said, noting that cutting those grants undermines programs looking to improve health for underserved communities and women.
Court challenges continue.
In August, the U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a temporary injunction for the termination of hundreds of NIH grant programs related to LGBTQ+ issues, agreeing with the plaintiffs would succeed in their claims that the terminations were discriminatory in nature.
Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior legal counsel and health care strategist for Lambda Legal, said that he hopes that the NIH complies with the injunction and chooses not to appeal the decision, though there is still time for the agency to file an appeal.
“It guarantees that, at minimum, LGBTQI health-related research won’t be completely stalled under this administration for the time being,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nihbuilding-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-09-15 06:57:03.965662

(Photo by T. Chavis/National Park Service)With access to beginner-friendly hikes with epic views as well as technical, multi-day and backcountry objectives for experts, the Taggart Lake trailhead in Grand Teton National Park is the busiest year-round trailhead in the park.
So busy, according to park officials, that on peak days more than 1,000 people flock to the site, and annual visitations tally more than 160,000.
“Use at Taggart Lake has increased more than 100% in the last 10 years,” Superintendent Chip Jenkins said. That compares to a 20% growth in overall park visitation, showing just how appealing it is.

Facilities are no longer adequate to serve the 700 or so average daily visitors, and park officials have sketched out a plan to expand the parking lot, reconfigure trails, install new toilets and improve other aspects of the trailhead area to accommodate mushrooming use.
Grand Teton National Park is seeking comment on an environmental assessment of the project. The 35-day comment period closes on Sept. 23.
During a Wednesday presentation on the environmental assessment, Jenkins said the so-called preferred alternative would create a more accessible and capacious site that would help protect the resources. Park data documented numerous instances of fecal matter and toilet paper near Taggart Lake in 2022, according to the assessment.
“We think that this preferred alternative will help us make for a better Taggart experience and for a better Grand Teton experience,” Jenkins said.
The project is estimated to cost $14.6 million to construct, with the Grand Teton National Park Foundation providing more than $10 million of that. Much of the remaining expense will be funded through appropriated federal dollars, primarily through the National Park Service Centennial Challenge, Jenkins said. Construction is anticipated to begin in 2026.
The project underscores how Grand Teton and neighboring Yellowstone National Park are wrestling with growing visitors who are filling parking lots, crowding trails and putting a strain on park services like bathrooms and search and rescue.
 Trailhead is Grand Teton National Park hotspot 

As a launching-off point for popular hikes near the park’s southern entrance, the trailhead is one of the most common places for people to start their visit to Grand Teton, Jenkins said. It’s also a well-used parking spot for skiers setting out on winter adventures.
Site maintenance has not kept pace with usage growth. Park officials have been gathering public comment on the Taggart Lake experience for the last year to guide improvements to the site. Proposals are mapped out in the environmental assessment. Under the preferred alternative, the project would:

Expand the parking lot.
Install new permanent toilets and a water station.
Redesign the trailhead area and create more accessible pathways.
Make improvements to the Taggart Lake shoreline to better define access points.
Improve facilities at the nearby Cottonwood Creek Picnic area.

Objectives of the plan include better safety for bicyclists and better protection for nearby wildlife, according to the assessment.

The environmental assessment also contains a “no action” alternative, under which Grand Teton would continue to maintain the project area as is.
If the preferred action option takes place, the Taggart Lake trailhead upgrades would be among several construction projects scheduled for the park through 2028.
 Taggart Lake trailhead use an example of broader visitation challenges

The busy Taggart Lake trailhead underscores the broader challenges growing visitation presents to national park managers.
Grand Teton and Yellowstone both reported record visitation in 2021. Visitations dipped since then, but the overall trend is still climbing.
Right now, Grand Teton is on track to tally its second-highest year for visitation, Jenkins said. Yellowstone, meanwhile, has tallied 3.5 million recreation visits through August, up slightly from 2024 but still behind pace to top 2021.
“Our infrastructure is not always adequate for current visitation numbers, let alone for increasing future levels,” Jenkins said during a congressional field hearing held in the park last week.



Though both parks have implemented measures like camping reservations, vehicle limits at crowded lots and a pilot shuttle system, they have yet to adopt more drastic tools like timed-entry systems that Arches and Rocky Mountain National Parks have adopted to manage huge crowds.
Public lands advocates are keeping a close eye on national parks this year in the wake of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency efforts. Since the Trump administration took office, the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff, according to the National Parks Conservation Association.
It appears Wyoming’s parks avoided the brunt of those cuts. Yellowstone National Park’s 2025 staffing is higher than last year, a park spokeswoman told WyoFile.

(Photo: Meharry Medical College via Facebook)NASHVILLE — The Trump administration has eliminated $2 million in HIV research facility funding for Meharry Medical College after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the National Institutes of Health to cancel hundreds of millions of dollars in DEI-linked funding for biomedical research.
Meharry, one of the nation’s oldest and largest historically Black medical schools, intended to use the funding for a “cutting-edge and modern HIV research space.”
For decades, Meharry scientists have investigated why minority populations are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS, working in tandem with Vanderbilt University and other organizations. Meharry was seeking to expand its capacity to conduct clinical trials and produce groundbreaking research.
The grant was terminated in March with no explanation or path of recourse.
“We are very disappointed, because we are working hard and we had a vision for this lab, and now that will not materialize anymore, at least for the time being,” Vladimir Berthaud, the grant’s principal investigator, said. Berthaud has worked at Meharry for nearly 25 years and was instrumental in founding the Meharry Center for HIV/AIDS Health Disparities Research in 2005.
At the same time, Berthaud said he is thankful that the NIH reinstated funding that was initially frozen for a long-standing grant that supports  investigators from Meharry and partner institutions who are studying the inner-workings of the virus to inform efforts to develop a cure and vaccine for HIV, an area of research with limited funding.
The cuts to Meharry are among $783 million in NIH funding eliminated by the federal government for a broad spectrum of disease research — including cancer, Alzheimer’s, and heart disease —  that had diversity, equity and inclusion components. The Trump administration decision to eliminate the programs was upheld in a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in August. 
The NIH cuts are among a “catastrophic” series of federal HIV/AIDS program eliminations this year, disrupting the ongoing work of preventing, testing, treating and developing a vaccine for the disease in the U.S. and worldwide, said John Meade, a senior program manager for AVAC, a nonprofit that focuses on HIV/AIDS prevention.
See what research at Tennessee universities was defunded in Trump’s federal grant cuts

Thus far this year, the government has eliminated 191 HIV-specific grants worth $200 million, and brought 56% of active HIV clinical trials to a halt, Meade said. 
It has terminated U.S.-backed international HIV research and slashed the NIH workforce tasked with HIV/AIDS work. In May, the NIH announced it would eliminate the annual $67 million budget for the Consortia for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development, which has worked to develop a vaccine for the disease.
“This will leave a hole in infectious disease research for the long term,” said Meade, who noted HIV/AIDS funding is especially vulnerable to anti-DEI initiatives because the disease disproportionately impacts people of color and LGBTQ individuals. 
“I believe there was a very targeted attack when it came to HIV specifically, primarily because the populations it primarily impacts,” he said.
Local advocates said the federal research cuts will have a direct impact on people living with HIV/AIDS or those at risk for contracting it.
“The sum total of federal cuts to research, prevention and suppression send the intended message: the government doesn’t care about eliminating HIV,” said Molly Quinn, executive director for OUTMemphis, an LGBTQ advocacy organization that offers support and services to people living with HIV/AIDS.
“As a service provider for HIV patients, these cuts make it harder for us to do our work, more likely for people to remain untested, and harder for patients to get the health care they need,” she said.  “Service providers across the South have to stand together and redouble our efforts, because we’re all interconnected. HIV can be eliminated, but our silence won’t save us.”
 HIV/AIDS research in jeopardy 

Meharry and Vanderbilt established a teaching, research and patient care alliance in 1999. Both schools have received NIH funding for AIDS-related research for years.
In 2003, NIH granted the schools $2.25 million over three years to establish a new Center for AIDS Research operated by the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance. At the time, the center was the first to include a historically Black university like Meharry.










We envisioned a lot of opportunities, so those opportunities are gone for research and training for what they call the next generation of HIV researchers.


– Don't forget to add author


NIH funding supported the creation of the Meharry Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research in 2005. A decade later, a five-year NIH grant allowed Meharry and Vanderbilt to expand their AIDS research center to include the Tennessee Department of Health, establishing the Tennessee Center for AIDS Research (CFAR.) 
By 2020, the center grew into a partnership between Vanderbilt, Meharry, the state health department and Nashville CARES, an HIV/AIDS service nonprofit providing education, confidential testing and support services to more than 20,000 Tennesseans.
NIH granted an additional $7.5 million meant to span five years “to enable the CFAR to continue its efforts to reduce the burden of HIV by supporting a wide range of scientific research, training and mentoring, and community engagement in Tennessee and beyond,” according to a May 2020 news release.
The funding was, in part, a result of the Biden administration’s effort to implement diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives now being gutted by the Trump administration. 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center grant cuts may include faculty, research diversity initiatives

In response to former President Joe Biden’s directive that each federal agency create a DEI plan, the NIH sought to redistribute research funding more broadly beyond elite colleges and universities to institutions that represent underserved communities. 
Historically black colleges and universities such as Meharry received infrastructure grants to expand their research capacity in order to compete for future grants, such as the $2 million grant to upgrade lab facilities at Meharry, Meade said. 
“There was a lot put into HBCUs to increase their infrastructure so they would be able to carry out and be more competitive” against institutions like Harvard and Stanford, who have historically received the lion’s share of biomedical research funding, he said.
 $2M training facility grant terminated; others reinstated

The $2 million award started on Sept. 16, 2022, but was terminated on March 21 before construction began. About $114,000 had already been spent on pre-construction activities when the remaining funds were rescinded, according to usaspending.gov, a government-run federal spending database.
Meharry worked closely with the NIH to ensure compliance with the highest standards in each step of the design process for the new center, which was 95% designed when the federal government terminated the funds needed to bring those plans into reality, Berthaud said.
The funding would have paid for a “cutting-edge and modern HIV research space” at the college, which has been researching “factors responsible for the profoundly disproportionate burden of HIV/AIDS among minority populations” for the last two decades in partnership with Vanderbilt and other organizations. 
The new lab facility would have included space and equipment for up to six new investigators near the Meharry Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, according to a grant summary. The center’s current setup features four labs within the center and other HIV/AIDS investigators scattered among other university buildings.The lack of modern facility space “severely impedes” the college’s ability to attract new research faculty to the center, the grant summary states.
Because the grant was solely focused on construction of the lab, its termination did not impact any researchers’ employment. 
The loss of the grant doesn’t directly impact Meharry’s other work in HIV/AIDS research, but it does represent a setback in the college’s overall plans to attract other HIV researchers to come to Meharry for their work.
“We envisioned a lot of opportunities, so those opportunities are gone for research and training for what they call the next generation of HIV researchers,” Berthaud said. “And this was not just for Meharry. We’re supposed to train and offer opportunities for anyone around the country who would like to use this lab for training and research.”
A separate multi-million dollar award to continue work at the Research Centers in Minority Institutions Program in Health Disparities Research at Meharry Medical College was also terminated, but NIH reinstated funding around July. The grant is a renewal of a long-standing program that appears to stretch back to at least 2017, according to transaction history listed on usaspending.gov. 
Changes at NIH give political appointees greater power to fund or block research

 
The program is focused on eliminating health disparities, specifically in diseases with detrimental impacts on minority health, including HIV/AIDS, the award summary states. Mentoring early-career researchers and improving relationships with community organizations are among the program’s broader goals.
The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities obligated around $4 million to the program in late July, usaspending.gov records show.
Another grant funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration that supports international AIDS relief — the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) — was also reinstated after a funding freeze. The international program was founded in 2003 and has since saved more than 25 million lives, Berthaud said. Meharry uses PEPFAR funding to reduce mother-to-baby HIV transmission rates in multiple African countries, and conducts exchange programs with universities in low- and middle-income countries, according to the college.
Berthaud said that while HIV treatment is now relatively simple, staying on treatment can be difficult for people, especially those living in less wealthy countries.
“We shouldn’t let our guards off regarding HIV,” he said. “Yes, we have made tremendous progress, and most of this progress, we owe it to the NIH. The major discoveries in HIV research have been funded by the NIH.”
Meharry’s partner institutions have not publicly addressed the NIH funding cuts or freezes. 
Nashville CARES declined to comment while Vanderbilt University Medical Center offered no response. 
The recent federal funding cuts introduce more uncertainty in the timetable for a cure, or a vaccine, while HIV in Tennessee continues to grow.
There are nearly 20,000 people living with HIV in Tennessee, according to the state’s health department. Memphis is among the top 50 cities for new HIV infections.
“The biggest thing is that it continues to slow down the process to study HIV and hopefully find a way to do vaccine trials that people have been waiting for,” said Ray Holloman, chair of the transgender task force at the Tennessee Equality Project.
“There’s been years and years of these grants coming through and the government saying, yes, we need to find a cure and, now, it’s not so much,” he said.

In addition to working in labs, participants in the Duke scholars program created poster presentations of the lab work and explained their research to audiences, familiar exercises for scientists attending professional conferences.

About 5% of doctors in the United States are Black, according to 2023 data from the Association of American Medical Colleges, while about 14.4 % of the U.S. population identified as Black that year, according to the Pew Research Center. 
In 2024, 6.6% of the doctorates in STEM awarded to Americans or naturalized citizens were earned by Black researchers. 
While more than 19% of the population was Hispanic/Latino in 2023, about 6.5% of the medical doctors were Latino. Latino scientists earned 10% of the research doctoral degrees awarded that year in science, technology, engineering and math. 
As it targets diversity and equity, the Trump administration has ended funding for projects that encourage a diverse STEM workforce, research by early-career scientists, and research about health disparities, HIV, mental health, and nutrition.
Programs at Duke, Stanford University, Hampton University, Washington University, and others lost federal money for programs aimed at increasing diversity in genomic research, according to a list of canceled grants obtained by U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (D-Raleigh). 
U-RISE was among the formerly federally funded programs supporting undergraduates who aspired to earn advanced degrees in biomedical research. The acronym stands for Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement.
UNC-Pembroke, the state’s Historically American Indian University, was one of the UNC campuses that had its U-RISE grant canceled.
The program matched eight students with faculty researchers, according to an online description. Its goals were to increase the number of students that applied for and entered STEM doctoral programs, provide them with a “rigorous research experience,” and prepare them to be successful scientists. 
The program ended after one year. 
Diversity and equity are targets of state and national politicians. Last year, the UNC system banned DEI policies. 
Efforts to increase diversity in biomedical sciences provides students with mentors, lab experience and a chance to form friendships with other students who share their goals. 
Students also learn what makes for a compelling research question and how to present their research in an engaging way, said Julie Posselt, a professor of Education at the University of Southern California who has published books on graduate education and equity in science.
“The mere existence of opportunities changes people’s aspirations,” she said. 










The NIH says they are not banned words, but there’s literal PDFs of banned words.


– Annelise Mennicke, UNC Charlotte professor


“The  long term effects will also be felt by the average American in terms of the access to new health care techniques, access to new technologies, improvements to systems that affect all of us,” she said.
Grants aimed at increasing the presence of marginalized groups in STEM were the first to be targeted, said Ebony McGee, an expert on diversity in STEM education. The elimination of funds aimed at marginalized communities in STEM will be a factor in deciding who continues in research careers, said McGee, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University. 
She knows of graduate students who would have quit their programs if not for the coaching they received. 
“It gave them a way to continue to be motivated in those racialized spaces and places,” she said.  
Generation of science lost
The canceled funding has not only stifled on-going research, it has pulled up the ladder for up-and-coming scientists, faculty and students at North Carolina universities told NC Newsline.
“There’s going to be an entire decade or generation of science that is left behind because all of the DEI programs are cut, all of the — I mean, the NIH says there are not banned words, but there’s literal PDFs of banned words,” said Annelise Mennicke, a UNC Charlotte professor studying counseling for LGBTQ+ survivors of sexual violence.
The federal government stripped funding from Mennicke’s study, which aimed to assess how to improve counseling options for LGBTQ+ individuals. As a researcher who focuses on gender and sexuality, she feels the National Institutes of Health has essentially barred support for her field.
“If we’re not able to study LGBTQ+ health, then that entire group of people is left out of the conversation,” Mennicke said. “Their health will worsen, will be set back because we don’t understand basic mechanisms of their health, but also we’re not training scientists to do that kind of research.”
The NIH has slashed hundreds of millions in research grants to North Carolina institutions with a focus on projects that the administration deems related to gender and sexuality, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and vaccine research.
For students, that means an abrupt stop to research they were involved in and a loss of future opportunities to grow their scientific abilities.

“I know people whose salaries have either been, you know, cut in half just by losing the supplemental fellowship income or totally just losing their summer fellowship,” said Nyssa Tucker, president of the UNC graduate workers’ union. “People are having to totally pivot in their directions — so folks who have been pursuing that as their thesis, their doctoral work, are now faced with the quandary of saying, ‘Do I keep doing this?’”
Even where funding has been reinstated — Mennicke’s research money is once again flowing — graduate students may not return. “What can’t be reinstated is the negative impacts on the students,” Mennicke said. “This was undermining their belief in public health and in the value of the science that they were doing.”
Epidemiology and community health professor Jessamyn Moxie, Mennicke’s co-lead on the study, said two of the original student researchers on the project did not return. “Morale was just broken,” Mennicke said. 
Those who did come back largely asked to be kept out of the loop on the status of funding.
“It was just so stressful for them to have that uncertainty. I think, in this era especially, you know, in the best of days, students being involved with research is a somewhat stressful activity for them,” Moxie said. “A lot of our team is LGBTQ, so you put the larger climate of uncertainty about rights and their safety that they’re already navigating, and this is their employment — across UNC Charlotte, generally, a lot of our students work in order to survive.”
“The students really I think just wanted to dial this down in this one area that they could choose to dial down the uncertainty for themselves,” Moxie added.
The future of  the project is still uncertain. Mennicke said there had not been clear communication from the university on what the recent Supreme Court decision authorizing grant cancellations means for researchers at the school.
“Nobody really knows what the impacts of that Supreme Court case will be for individual researchers,” Mennicke said. “We’re still kind of waiting and seeing and acting as if we have — because we have the grant right now. So we’re just going to get on with the rigorously evaluated, peer-reviewed process that we went through to do the science that we believe in.”
Up in smoke
Students are also losing access to fellowship programs that helped them to connect with scientific peers and mentors, another avenue that has long fostered research careers. In April, the NIH canceled its MOSAIC program, aimed at helping postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds transition into faculty careers.

Mark Peifer, a cell biology professor at UNC Chapel Hill, said it was shameful that the government was canceling research awards to talented scientists “for reasons that have nothing to do with science.”
“It’s targeted at something really important, right, which is helping people make that really critical transition between post-doctoral fellow and faculty,” Peifer said. “People were worried that they wouldn’t be able to get a job and so many of our most talented scientists were choosing to move into the private sector.”
These programs serve a dual purpose: They help propel burgeoning young scientists while also bringing outside funding to research projects at universities that may not have otherwise been possible.
The administration’s actions, Peifer added, have had a chilling effect on private fellowships aimed at diversity as well. He pointed to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which canceled its $60 million inclusive excellence program as well as pausing the Hanna Gray Fellowship for early-career researchers. 
“What we’re learning is that this cohort building experience is really, really powerful at accelerating people’s development as scientific leaders, you know, because you’ve got people to talk to,” he said. “This is a phenomenal program.”










We’re going to definitely see a drop in the number of people who can do research of any type here in Chapel Hill, but I mean, across the nation.


– Nyssa Tucker, president, UNC graduate workers union


Moxie, the epidemiology and community health professor, expressed concern that the loss of opportunities would prevent young researchers from finding their lifelong passions. She said one of her formative research experiences was an ethnographic study on people living with HIV in Vietnam, which helped lead her into a career aimed at sexual health. 
“Researchers feel like it is gatekept for many students. They don’t know how to break into something that feels bigger than them,” Moxie said. “I think that when that is the case, then when the opportunities are limited, many students, if they enter in one particular area, that may not be the thing that ignites them.”
Tucker, the student worker union president — herself a toxicology and environmental health researcher — said it feels like “these careers are just up in smoke.”
“It’s not only people’s careers, it’s their livelihood, but also the work is done to benefit everyone,” Tucker said. “We’re going to definitely see a drop in the number of people who can do research of any type here in Chapel Hill, but I mean, across the nation.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Duke-Poster-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-09-15 06:57:03.965662

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Army Sgt. Chase Murray)North Dakota National Guard troops have not been requested for local or federal law enforcement operations, according to the governor’s office.
State Guard officials have not had any specific discussions about deploying soldiers and airmen domestically, said Adjutant General Mitchell Johnson.
About 1,000 North Dakota National Guard members trained last weekend in their specialties, Johnson told the North Dakota Monitor, but there have not been any discussions about deploying them imminently to assist with crime reduction or immigration enforcement operations.
“I would say we are always training to be ready for whatever we might be called for,” Johnson said. 
Johnson, also director of the Department of Emergency Services and an Air Force brigadier general, said Friday the National Guard can be activated either federally or by the state to support firefighters and local law enforcement.
What deployments look like are “situation dependent,” Johnson said, and responsive to each scenario as it comes in.

“Bottom line is, if resources are exceeded, and local resources are exceeded, for instance firefighting resources are not enough, then there’s a good chance that the National Guard is an answer, maybe not the answer, but an answer to that acute problem,” Johnson said.
He said he has not participated in any preliminary discussions about deploying National Guard members or resources to assist with local or federal law enforcement operations domestically.
Johnson said the 54 adjutant generals from all 50 states, three U.S. territories and Washington, D.C., hold regular calls on administrative concerns involving Guard members, but those typically revolve around funding, not specific deployments.
More than a dozen states have approved recent National Guard deployments to Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles with some ordered to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to Stateline.
On Friday, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee confirmed to the Tennessee Lookout that he’s been in “constant communication” with President Donald Trump’s administration about deploying the state’s National Guard members to Memphis as part of an effort to crack down on crime.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong was unavailable for an interview last week. Spokesperson Mike Nowatzki declined to answer questions about what circumstances could prompt the governor to authorize a National Guard deployment.
“We don’t speculate on potential North Dakota National Guard deployments,” Nowatzki said in a statement.
He added using National Guard soldiers and resources is a decision that is “not taken lightly” since every deployment pulls soldiers and airmen away from their families and employers.
“We all realize how important it is to support the citizens of North Dakota and also what it means to take Guardsmen away from their day jobs to do that, so it’s always a balance,” Johnson said.
Johnson said the state’s National Guard can perform crowd control and other types of law enforcement operations, but most of the time the Guard’s military police or security forces perform those types of actions.
North Dakota National Guard to assist search effort after flash flooding in central Texas

North Dakota National Guard members have supported law enforcement operations in the past, including during the 2016 and 2017 Dakota Access Pipeline protests, though they did not make arrests.
North Dakota Guard troops have also been deployed multiple times to the southern border.
“Every situation is unique, with multiple variables to consider in determining whether Guard mobilization is appropriate and, if so, under which status,” Nowatzki said.
State national guards can be activated by the governor and paid for by the state. They can also be deployed and paid for by the federal government under Title 10. A third option is a deployment controlled by the state, but funded and regulated by the federal government.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott requested Guard assistance from Armstrong in July through a state-to-state emergency compact in the aftermath of flash flooding that killed more than 135 people. Johnson said North Dakota’s Fargo-based 119th Wing of the North Dakota Air National Guard flew drone operations from Fargo for seven days in Texas in response to Abbott’s request, which cost the state about $22,000. State deployments were also authorized in the past to combat wildfires or help with natural disaster recovery.

(Photo by Lexi Browning/West Virginia Watch)Funding for 17 research projects at West Virginia University has been cancelled or suspended, including federal research dollars axed by President Donald Trump. The Republican president cancelled billions of dollars in research money for universities as he pushes for a more conservative ideology in higher education. 
Shauna Johnson, WVU’s executive director of strategic communications, said the cancelled research projects had been supported by a mix of state, foundation and federal grants.
“WVU is an R1 university where quality education and the cutting edge go hand-in-hand. Budget reductions in research and student aid will have an impact on the university’s education and research missions,” Johnson said. 
The funding cancellation or suspension included some multi-institution projects on which WVU was a partner.
Federal funding agencies that were supposed to fund projects included the U.S. Department of Education, National Endowment for the Humanities and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Documents shared by the university showed that the EPA had canceled more than $945,000 in funding for WVU’s Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design.
“WVU has worked with our congressional delegation, and with our higher education partners overall, in efforts to preserve research funding,” Johnson said. 
“It’s important to note that federal funding investments in research have implications far beyond the present day. The research we are doing now will benefit future generations and we are hopeful the support will be continued,” she continued. 
Trump’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion policies directives has also impacted higher education funding. Johnson explained that the anti-DEI directives had impacted some research funding at WVU, but it was not the main reason for cancelled or stalled projects.
The president cancelled $783 million in National Institutes of Health research funding for any projects tied to federal DEI efforts. The U.S. The Supreme Court last month upheld Trump’s directive, which is expected to slash hundreds of research projects nationwide.
“To my knowledge, there has been no loss of funding linked to DEI initiatives at Marshall.  Additionally, the impact of new federal guidelines on research grants has been minimal at Marshall University,” said Leah Payne, director of university communications at Marshall.
Hans Fogle, executive director of university communications at Shepherd University, said “None of our federal grants have been cancelled due to any assertion of a DEI issue.”

Severe weather reduced crop yield, inflation made production more costly and trade negotiations with China, Tennessee's largest soybean customer, mean prices are too low to profit. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)As Tennessee soybean farmers harvest their crop after a difficult growing season, they are facing a farm economy that resembles “death by a thousand cuts,” Tennessee Soybean Promotion Council Executive Director Stefan Maupin said.
Persistent inflation since the pandemic has made it more expensive for farmers to produce crops, and weather extremes over the last year mean they will see a significant loss in yield, he said. 
On top of that, bushels will soon hit a market where prices are low and Tennessee’s largest soybean export partner, China, is entirely absent amid trade negotiations with the Trump Administration. 
“We’re in a significant and desperate situation where … none of the crops that farmers grow right now return a profit,” Maupin said. “They don’t even break even.”
Another year in the red will be tough to survive for farmers still struggling to recover from last year’s losses, he added.
Soybeans are Tennessee’s most prominent row crop, logging more than $990 million in cash receipts in 2023. Tennessee farmers planted around 1.75 million acres of soybeans in 2025, mostly in West and Middle Tennessee.










We’re in a significant and desperate situation where … none of the crops that farmers grow right now return a profit. They don’t even break even.


– Stefan Maupin, Tennessee Soybean Promotion Council


Soybeans also topped the state’s commodity exports in 2023, bringing in $489.4 million, followed by cotton at $302.7 million. Soybean meal came in fourth with $129.6 million in export earnings, according to United States Department of Agriculture data.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January and began imposing tariffs on imported goods — including Chinese imports — China has answered with its own tariffs on U.S. goods. China began boycotting the purchase of U.S. soybeans in May, according to the New York Times, turning instead to crops from Brazil and other South American countries.
American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland urged Trump in an August 19 letter to reach a deal with China to remove retaliatory tariffs and secure soybean purchase commitments. 
“U.S. soybean farmers cannot survive a prolonged trade dispute with our largest customer,” Ragland wrote.
The American Soybean Association points to losses farmers experienced during trade tensions between China and the U.S. in 2018. Soybean farmers in the United States lost $9.4 billion that year, according to a USDA estimate.

A University of Tennessee Agriculture Extension study estimates that Tennessee experienced a total economic loss of nearly $40 million due to uncertainty caused by soybean tariffs in 2018, even when considering government payments made to soybean farmers in an effort to offset their loss of income.
Maupin said that Tennessee soybean producers are exporting to other countries, but demand outside of China — where the market is expanding — is not as high.
University of Tennessee estimates soybean losses at $110 million for 2025
Maupin said farmers’ financial strain is evident in the math.
The USDA predicts an average yield of 53.5 bushels per acre for soybeans this year. Maupin said this is likely too high an estimate for Tennessee, where spring storms brought widespread flooding in West Tennessee fields that delayed planting, and the dry weeks that followed starved plants of moisture. Tennessee averaged 47.4 bushels per acre from 2014 to 2024. This year, Maupin has heard some farmers say they’re looking at closer to 30 bushels an acre due to the dry conditions, he said.
Based on an average yield of 50 bushels per acre, farmers are projected to lose about $84 per acre on soybeans as of Aug. 12, according to estimates from the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture. If a farmer has 3,000 acres, that’s a roughly quarter-million dollar loss.
Estimates may change as costs fluctuate, but prices so far have hovered more than a dollar below UT’s estimated break-even price of $11.72 per bushel. The university’s Aug. 12 report estimates losses of nearly $110 million for Tennessee soybeans this year.
As difficult as conditions are for soybean farmers, Tennessee’s other major row crops — cotton, corn and wheat — are expected to see even higher losses per acre, according to the University of Tennessee. Farm level net losses for the state’s four primary row crops are expected to top $360 million in 2025.
Weather, inflation and tariffs squeeze farmers
Alan Meadows started working on his fifth-generation family farm in Lauderdale County when he graduated from high school about 25 years ago.
“This has been a really tough year for us,” he said.
Lauderdale County was among several West Tennessee counties to suffer flooding in April. Meadows planted his soybeans in late March.
“It started off really good … we were in the field in late March, which is early for us,” he said. “But then the wheels came off, so to speak, pretty quick.”
Before the plants could sprout, a four-day downpour dumped about 13 inches of water on the fields. Some of the crop was lost, and Meadows had to replant. If the crops continued to see some rainfall, that wouldn’t be an issue, he said, “but you know, as luck would have it, we turned out extremely dry this summer.”
Flood fallout poses challenges for West Tennessee soybean farmers

Supplies and equipment were more expensive this year, too, Meadows added, due to inflation and import tariffs.
“So much of what has happened and what’s going on here is totally out of our control,” he said. 
“We just want a free, fair and open market where we can sell our goods … as competitively as anybody else around the world,” Meadows said. “And we do feel that we produce a superior product here in the United States, and we just need to have the markets.”
Planning for 2026 and searching for relief
Even if a favorable trade deal is reached soon, Maupin said it will likely be too late for Tennessee’s soybean farmers to benefit.
“It will be very difficult to survive this year, and they’re harvesting crops now,” he said. 
Farmers pay most bills yearly, after revenue from selling their crops comes in. With projected losses, this means farms will not have money to pay electric bills, house and tractor payments, among other needs, Maupin said.
For those that have enough equity to hold out a little longer, he estimates the tide will need to turn before December, when farmers typically decide what to purchase and plant for the next growing season. 
Farmers, like other businesses, depend on financing to cover pre-sale costs. 
“Right now this year and looking like going into next year, the crop will not cash flow,” Maupin said, so farmers will likely have to put up something else — their farm, home, vehicles, or anything that holds equity — to secure the loan.
If next year’s harvest returns another loss instead of a profit, they risk losing that collateral. 
Those in the toughest position are younger farmers who “have just not had the opportunity to build up their equity in order to survive economic conditions like this,” Maupin said.
Soybean farmers are looking toward other possible uses that may help increase domestic sales. Maupin said biofuels hold potential, and the budget reconciliation bill passed in July included biofuel incentives that could provide a boost for that industry next year.
Farmers will continue to work with some states like California and Washington that are working to put fuel standards in place, but it’s not clear how widespread adoption will be across the country.
Ultimately, Maupin said, farmers will need help from the federal government.
Congress has not passed a new Farm Bill — multiyear legislation that authorizes funding for agricultural and food programs — since 2018. Instead, lawmakers have signed one-year extensions. The American Relief Act of 2025 extended the 2018 Farm Bill’s programs through Sept. 30. 
Maupin said without a fresh farm bill, “we do not have a workable safety net program when things like this happen in our economy.”
In the meantime, Maupin acknowledges the mental toll on farmers. 
“They have done everything right, they’ve managed their finances well, they have put in a good crop … but they cannot change the weather, they cannot change the economy, they cannot change the markets,” he said. “The weather is in the control of a higher power, and the economy and the markets are in control of Washington, D.C.”

CoreCivic, which owns the 752-bed site, then listed job openings for detention officers in Walsenburg “contingent on contract award,” the Colorado Sun reported in July.
The facility also showed up on an internal ICE planning document from July obtained by The Washington Post, along with new detention sites in Hudson and Ignacio and an expansion of the existing Aurora facility.
The correctional center was operational until 2010 and housed inmates from Arizona as the Colorado Department of Corrections moved away from using private prisons. If it reopened under an ICE contract, it would be part of an ongoing effort to expand detention and deportation efforts under the Trump administration. Those plans are bolstered by $45 billion in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved over the summer.
City and county leaders say they have no control over whether CoreCivic enters into a contract with ICE.
“The city doesn’t have a say in this,” said Walsenburg Interim City Administrator John Galusha. “The prison is permitted and has every right to open, as far as we’re concerned.”
Galusha said a CoreCivic representative called him in early September to establish communication, but did not have any information about when or if the site could open.
“There’s been discussion about opening the Walsenburg facility and it’s been around all over, including ICE internal memos, but there’s no commitment one way or another yet,” he said.

At the same time, businesses that operate in southern Colorado are preparing for the possibility. In a Sept. 4 email obtained by Colorado Newsline, the aviation director of the Pueblo Memorial Airport sought to connect Freeman Jet Center, an aviation services company, with CoreCivic leadership.
“They manage multiple jet centers across the US and service the ICE deportation flights in other communities,” Greg Pedroza wrote to Walsenburg city administration. “I am hoping you may have a contact with the detention center in Walsenburg who can speak to Freeman Jet Center management to propose Pueblo Airport to provide service to these flights, if needed.”
Pedroza did not return a request for comment.
A city administrator forwarded his email to Andrea Evans, a senior director at CoreCivic, who responded that she would send the information to her team. Freeman Jet Center did not respond to a request for comment or information about where they currently service immigration flights.
In a statement, CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin said that the company plays a “limited and important role” in the American immigration system and works within ICE’s established procurement process.
“We know this is a highly charged, emotional issue for many people, but the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively,” Gustin said. “These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
‘Not our dream situation’
The opening of the facility is a massive unknown, but many leaders would be supportive and welcoming of it, said Carlton Croft, the executive director of Huerfano County Economic Development. It would bring jobs, sales tax revenue and create a major utility customer.
“We need something to bring in younger families, and that’s jobs and economic growth,” he said. “This is not our dream situation, but we need the economic driver that something like this facility could bring.”
“It’s just hard in rural Colorado to attract the jobs, and if we don’t have jobs, these communities can slowly die and blow away,” Croft added.
Huerfano County has a median household income of about $52,000 and an employment rate of about 37%, according to recent census data. Colorado’s employment rate sits at about 65%.
Croft said he would love major manufacturers or data centers to set up in the county — he highlighted cosmetic manufacturer Chaé Organics as an example of Huerfano County success — but energy and infrastructure needs can be massive barriers. It also takes years and a large amount of capital investment to build those sites. The mothballed detention facility already exists, and has the right permits.

But others aren’t so sure about the sustainability of an ICE detention center as an economic driver in the county.
“It’s true there will be some significant revenues, but it will be short-term,” said Brian Lalander, who was the town’s mayor in 2020 and 2021 and now sits on the Historic Preservation Commission. “Let’s be realistic — these kinds of facilities are financed based on political ideology. This is not going to be the solution to Walsenburg’s economic problems.{
There is also the question of whether an operational detention center would draw its workforce from the county itself or attract commuters from Pueblo, Trinidad and other surrounding cities. Huerfano County has an aging population and a median age of 55 years old, and there’s not a lot of housing, especially rental properties.
“We’re very lucky that we have a nice hospital, but they’ve got most of the professional staff coming in from Colorado Springs and from Pueblo,” Croft said. “Very few actually live in our county, and we’ve got to figure out a way to make that possible.”
If the correctional facility opens up as an ICE detention center, it could need a few hundred employees, but those workers might not meaningfully contribute to Walsenburg’s economy if they live, shop and dine elsewhere.
“They’ll get an extra soft drink on their way home from Loves, but it won’t have this great effect,” Lalander said.
Still, Croft said he has picked up calls from hotels, restaurants and retail stores since the news of a possible ICE facility broke. Those would not be economic powerhouses, he said, but they would bring in a modest amount of jobs. Galusha said he remembered at least three more restaurants in town when the detention center was open.
A group of protestors have demonstrated in Walsenburg against the Trump administration every Friday since mid-February, and their attention is now largely focused on the detention center. Dee Maes-Sandoval is one of the few dozen who show up regularly. The Walsenburg native now lives in Colorado Springs and said she sees a level of apathy from Walsenburg residents on the issue.
“We’re kidnapping people because of the color of their skin,” she said, referencing immigration enforcement operations. “Read books about the Holocaust and what happened. We’re in the beginning stages, and people turned a blind eye because they didn’t want to get involved.”
Maes-Sandoval said she does not believe a detention center would be an economic boom to Walsenburg, since the workforce would likely come from outside the city. She sees hope in a lawsuit over a planned ICE facility at a CoreCivic property in Leavenworth, Kansas, where the city tried to block the prison’s reopening as an immigration detention center over permitting ordinances. A judge ruled in favor of the city and issued a temporary restraining order in June.
“The (city) ordinances presented a problem for that, and that’s what we’re hoping for in this case,” Maes-Sandoval said. “We’re hoping we can find something to stop it.”
That would require money and political willpower from the city or county. Maes-Sandoval acknowledges that CoreCivic is acting as if everything will move forward, and she won’t be surprised if it reopens. She drives to the facility when she can, and has noted the new barbed wire around the perimeter. If it does reopen, she said she will continue her activism.
“It’ll just mean that we will be out there more,” she said. “We will be out there, protesting at the site and seeing what we can do to help the people who will be detained there.”

Sign up for Dispatches to get stories in your inbox every week.
For years, North Dakota’s mineral owners have said state officials have ignored their pleas for help as companies deduct money from their share of income from oil and gas production. 
Now, some state lawmakers agree they need to take action. Responding to a recent North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica investigation, more than a half-dozen said a committee should study the issue and propose solutions before the next legislative session in 2027. Others suggested changes to state law, including one proposal to prohibit deductions unless a lease specifically allows them and another that would require companies and royalty owners to renegotiate their contracts every few decades. 

This is the fourth story in a series. Read the collection here.

The Legislature meets every other year. North Dakota lawmakers rejected proposals to protect private mineral owners in 2021 and 2023, and did not address the issue during this year’s session.
“It will definitely come up in 2027,” said Sen. Chuck Walen, a Republican from New Town. “I don’t know what the outcome will be, but it will definitely be coming up.”
North Dakota officials have taken steps to safeguard state-owned royalties. Since 1979, all state leases with oil and gas companies prohibit deductions. But that protection does not extend to leases that are negotiated by North Dakota’s estimated 300,000 private mineral owners.
“I definitely think something has to be done, especially since the state has protected itself,” said Rep. Patrick Hatlestad, a Republican from Williston. “I think it needs to do something similar for its citizens.”
Some lawmakers also have suggested they may need to make changes to the state’s postproduction royalty oversight program, created in 2023 to address minerals owners’ mounting frustration about postproduction deductions — the money companies withhold to cover the costs of processing and transporting minerals after they are extracted and before they are sold. That program has not alleviated concerns over postproduction deductions and, as of August, had not resolved any cases about that issue, the news organizations found.
Why it matters
Mineral owners have the rights to oil and gas found underground. They can lease those rights to companies in exchange for a cut of the revenue when oil is produced, called a royalty. 
But while the leases have remained the same for decades, the industry has changed. Oil and gas are now sold farther from the well, and companies incur more transportation and other costs to get the products to the point of sale. The companies pass on a portion of those costs to mineral owners, which North Dakota courts have determined is usually legal unless a lease says otherwise. 
Most leases signed decades ago don’t explicitly mention postproduction deductions, and leases don’t expire unless oil production lapses. 
North Dakota mineral owners say oil companies unfairly keep millions from checks without oversight

Deductions began surging in North Dakota about a decade ago. About 20% of royalties are deducted, on average, according to two estimates as well as interviews with royalty owners. That would have amounted to about $1 billion in 2023. 
Estimates provided by the North Dakota Petroleum Council suggest companies withhold at least hundreds of millions of dollars in North Dakota every year.
Why some lawmakers are pushing for change  
Several lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Don Longmuir, said that because the state’s legislative season is a relatively short 80 days, it’s important to have an interim legislative committee conduct a study and propose a solution ahead of the 2027 session.  
“We can’t wait until the session starts,” said Longmuir, of Stanley, in the oil-producing region of the state. “That’s something that you know really needs to happen before session starts, so that maybe they can come up with something.”
Assigning a new study to an interim committee would require a directive from Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, chair of the Legislative Management Committee. Hogue, a Republican from Minot, said he “would consider it” and will likely make a decision in the next month or two.
“I really need to do more self-education right now,” Hogue said. The recent series has raised “awareness that there is an issue out there,” he said. 
Sen. Dale Patten, who has served as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and would likely have influence over any legislation, said he is open to a formal legislative study but said it should be initiated only with input from the full Legislature.
“I would be comfortable with taking a look at it and see if there’s a way to resolve it,” said Patten, a Republican from Watford City. 
Some lawmakers are already thinking about ways to address the issue in the next session. 
One lawmaker said he may introduce legislation that would limit the length of leases to 30 years. Republican Sen. Jeff Magrum, who represents Hazelton and has supported landowners on other issues, said he hopes limiting leases will give future generations of mineral owners the opportunity to renegotiate contracts and incentivize companies to be more mindful of how they treat North Dakotans. 
“I don’t think that’s right for someone that’s not even born yet to have to honor a contract that I signed today. It’s just not fair to them,” Magrum said. “Look at how times have changed. Everything’s changed and they’re stuck in the contract that was written in the 1950s.” 
Magrum has introduced 13 bills related to property rights issues in the past two legislative sessions. All but one failed.
They can’t get answers from the oil industry. North Dakota’s oversight program hasn’t helped.

Rep. David Richter, a Republican from Williston, said he thinks it would be difficult for the Legislature to modify existing leases in that way, but it could limit the length of future leases.  
“Going forward, I think that might be an option worth taking a really hard look at,” Richter said. “But that doesn’t do anything to alleviate the situation of the leases that are already in place.”
For those existing leases, Richter said it is often “unclear” whether deductions are permitted, and some lawmakers said they should pass a state law to address the issue.
Richter said he prefers that companies and mineral owners renegotiate the contracts to specify whether deductions are permitted. But if that doesn’t happen, he said he is open to legislation that would “clarify” how leases that don’t mention deductions should be interpreted by the courts.
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, a Democrat from Fargo, said lawmakers should pass a  law stating that companies can’t take postproduction deductions unless leases explicitly allow them to do so. Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Republican from Williston who supports oil development but who also has tried to help mineral owners, proposed such a measure in 2021. 
“We could write legislation clarifying this easily,” Hogan said. “But we’ve never been able to get it done.”
Industry, state officials respond
Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, an organization that lobbies on behalf of more than 550 oil and gas companies, said many of the proposals would be a “substantial infringement” on mineral owners’ property rights. 
“We believe direct state involvement/interference in the contractual agreements of hundreds of thousands of private mineral leases is the wrong approach,” Ness wrote in an email. “Suggested actions like this would have a detrimental impact on mineral development in North Dakota.”
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican who worked for his family’s privately owned oil company earlier in his career, did not respond to a request for comment for this article. 
But during an Aug. 18 appearance on a KFGO radio program, the governor said he was open to making tweaks to the royalty oversight program. The program was created by legislators in 2023 and was envisioned as a way to mediate disputes about deductions between mineral owners and companies, but that hasn’t happened. 
Some states restrict the oil industry from taking mineral owners’ earnings. Not North Dakota.

“If this one isn’t working, we should find out why not and figure out if we can tweak it and make it better,” Armstrong said.
Some lawmakers said they don’t see a need to take any action. 
Sen. Kent Weston, a Republican from Sarles, said he’s discussed the issue with colleagues in the Legislature and North Dakota Petroleum Council staff in recent weeks. He said the status quo is  “fair” and necessary to ensure the oil and gas industry continues to invest in the state.  
House Majority Leader Mike Lefor and Rep. Todd Porter, the longtime chair of the committee overseeing the energy industry in the House, could not be reached for comment.

(Courtesy of the National Park Service)LINCOLN — Nebraska would have to dig into its pocketbook if it wants to take over management of the scenic Niobrara River from the National Park Service.
That seems clear after officials from Ohio, a state that has a rare “cooperative agreement” to manage federally designated wild and scenic rivers within its state, told the Examiner that is spends $1.2 million a year on its state scenic river program. Ohio manages three, federally designated scenic rivers and 13 other streams that have either a state scenic, wild or recreation designation.
The state assigns 11 staff members to manage stream quality, promote preservation of forest corridors and scenery and protect sensitive areas along the streams, as well as assist landowners, developers and other stakeholders. State personnel also work with advisory councils associated with each of the scenic rivers to give local landowners and other interests a voice in management decisions.


Federal law
“It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States that certain selected rivers of the Nation which, with their immediate environments possess outstandingly remarkable scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, cultural, or other similar values, shall be preserved in free-flowing condition, and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.”
— An excerpt from the Federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968


The issue of cost came up after Nebraska State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman proposed an interim study of the state possibly taking over of management of the Niobrara River, a federally designated scenic river, from the National Park Service.
Part of Storer’s district includes the 75 miles of the Niobrara that was added to the federal list of wild and scenic rivers in 1991. The designation followed an effort that prevented the damming of the unique stream by the proposed Norden Dam.
Currently, the Park Service operates on an annual budget of $1.2 million to help police the popular river, help conserve the wild and scenic nature of the Niobrara and staff a visitors center in Valentine. In addition, the Niobrara Council, a committee of local officials that provides input and runs some river-related programs, gets about $52,000 a year from the state and, until this past year, $100,000 a year from the federal government to help fund its activities.
Advocates for retaining federal management of the Niobrara maintain that the State of Nebraska lacks the expertise and the funds — given its recent budget shortfalls — to take over river management. Meanwhile Storer and the head of a local natural resources district have pushed back on that, saying they doubt it would take too much money. They maintain that the interim study — set for a hearing at 1 p.m. on Friday at the State Capitol — will help answer the cost question.
Bob Gable, the scenic rivers administrator for the Ohio Division of Natural Areas and Preserves, said he could not separate how much of his state’s money and staff were devoted to Ohio’s three federally designated scenic rivers — the Big and Little Darby Creek, Little Beaver Creek and the Little Miami River. He said it wasn’t as simple as dividing the funding equally among the 16 rivers, which would be about $75,000 per river spent in Ohio.
Gable said managing federally designated rivers comes with additional coordination with the federal government. For instance, the National Park Service must review and approve water resource projects that impact banks and streams. All told, Ohio manages 945 miles of streams in its scenic river program, a program that began in 1968, a few months before the federal government passed the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
“This is a fact that we are very proud of,” Gable said in an email, of the Ohio program preceding the federal act.
Storer did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment on this story.
Sändra Washington, who worked with scenic river programs in Ohio and later with the Park Service, said it would be difficult to estimate what it might cost for the state to take over the management of the Niobrara River.
Much, said Washington, now a member of the Lincoln City Council, would depend on whether state agencies have the expertise to do it. It would certainly cost more to create a new scenic rivers program from scratch than if the state had an existing one.
Storer has said that uncertainty about federal funding for the National Park Service to manage the Niobrara River and funding for a local river advisory council, the Niobrara Council, call for a look at taking over management of the scenic river by the state and some local entities, such as the Middle Niobrara Natural Resources District.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, called for the cancellation of the lease on the scenic river visitors center in Valentine. That decision was later reversed.

Education requires that teachers and students feel free to try out ideas without fear that they will immediately be accused of bias and prejudice. Yet teachers will be forgiven for thinking it is too risky to discuss what American Jews and Israelis openly discuss as part of a genocide education unit.
The post State commission to combat antisemitism misses t[...]","LAST MONTH, the Massachusetts Special Commission for Combatting Antisemitism quietly passed a series of recommendations for K-12 education. As a Jewish American parent with two children in Massachusetts public schools, I do not look forward to the implementation of these recommendations.  
The commission said that public concerns about these recommendations, including those submitted by many Jews, were mainly about “semantics,” not substance. Much more than words are at stake. In practice, different aspects of the recommendations contradict each other or put staff, teachers, and students in impossible educational situations.  
The recommendations treat Jews differently from others, fail to create an open educational environment, and will produce a climate of confusion and suspicion. This can only make the problem of antisemitism worse not better. Consider some concrete examples. 
One of the commission’s recommendations is that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) establish an “Advisory Council on Holocaust and Genocide Education” to facilitate implementation of the “Genocide Education Mandate.”  
It is reasonable to ask teachers and students to have informed and curious discussions about genocide. However, the committee also says that educators and staff must “be informed by” the International Holocaust Remembrance Association (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. For unclear reasons, the committee chose the most politically controversial, even among Jews, definition of antisemitism.  
Various aspects of that definition make saying Israel is committing genocide a form of antisemitism. That means educators are ordered to have open and frank discussions about genocide, while making it impossible to consider whether what students learn about genocide may be applied to Israel. Regardless of whether you think Israel is doing that or not, given that Israelis themselves, including a former Israeli attorney general and former speaker of the Knesset, have said that Israel is doing so, means that it must be permissible to consider. But the committee’s recommendations cut that discussion off.  
Education requires that teachers and students feel free to try out ideas without fear that they will immediately be accused of bias and prejudice. Yet teachers will be forgiven for thinking it is too risky to discuss what American Jews and Israelis openly discuss as part of a genocide education unit. Subordinating instruction to what counts as antisemitism makes education look more like indoctrination. 
Elsewhere, the committee instructs the state education department to establish an anonymous government hotline for reporting antisemitic incidents as part of a “statewide Bias Reporting Program.” The committee claims this will help provide a way for students to report harassment and provide a “mechanism for reporting problematic curriculum.” In the absence of any guidance, beyond again being “informed by” the International Holocaust Remembrance Association definition of antisemitism, the committee seems to think that the judge of whether something was antisemitic is just how a hearer felt about it.  
So now students, teachers, and staff can fear that they might be anonymously reported based on a politicized definition of antisemitism. This will only further chill discussion and undercut teachers, who will have to tiptoe around anything perceived as controversial. Historically speaking, the kinds of societies where acquaintances can report each other anonymously to a government agency are not known for their open, high-quality learning environment.  
Consider another problem. One genuinely well-meaning recommendation is the development of new “model curricula and best practices” around “teaching antisemitism and Jewish identity” that “may include Jewish history, positive Jewish contributions to America, Jewish diversity, and manifestations of contemporary antisemitism.” On its own, this sounds fine. But when integrated with a “mandatory anti-bias education for school committees and all K-12 faculty and administrators that includes antisemitism,” anonymous reporting hotline, and that pesky definition of antisemitism, things look different.  
Somehow, antisemitism education now amounts to emphasizing “positive contributions” of Jews while condemning any negative statements about anything associated with Jews as antisemitic. The overall message will be that Jews don’t do bad things – unlike ordinary human beings they can’t hate others, or commit genocide, or be racist. To even suggest that will already to be under suspicion of antisemitism.  
Such an approach can only backfire. It sends the message that Jews are essentially different, almost inhumanly different. Worse than that, given that these messages will arrive as state-level mandates, it makes it seem like Jews are trying to force people to believe that they are different.  
There is no doubt that there are all kinds of nasty, antisemitic ways in which Jews are criticized as Jews. But the broad and confused way in which antisemitism is presented in the recommendations does not capture that problem. Instead, this “antisemitism education” will likely function in an actual classroom only to discourage or browbeat students into seeing Jews as different or special. That cannot possibly be good for reducing antisemitic prejudice. 
Finally, there is the wider problem of speech suppression. The commission said it values academic freedom. But the thrust of the recommendations is that if students feel that “protests, walkouts, postering,” and ordinary discussion are antisemitic, then the presumption is those acts of expression should be punished or shut down. There seems to be no thought at all about how in a diverse democracy like ours there will be vigorous and strong disagreements, which we accept and tolerate even if we happen to find them offensive.  
It is strange to see Massachusetts following in the footsteps of the Trump administration in its approach to education. And it cannot be good for the fight against antisemitism to associate Jews with new limits on speech and the degradation of the learning environment.  
The commission has tied its shoelaces together and then tried to start running. On the one hand, it issues new orders for educators and students to talk more about Jews, antisemitism, genocide, and Israel. On the other, it creates new disciplinary procedures and constraints, enforced according to poorly defined and politically controversial standards, that will make those conversations stilted and non-educational.  
Kids know when they are being set up or told that they may only think in certain ways, not others. Even on their own terms, these recommendations cannot possibly advance the aim of fighting antisemitism. Never mind how incompatible they are with open-minded education on controversial topics about which reasonable people might disagree.  
Instead of rushing these ill-considered measures out, right before the school year, the state should have hit pause. At minimum, the Massachusetts legislature needs to step in with some oversight of this Trumpist approach to educational policy. This issue is too important to mess up.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)When I think about healthcare in Tennessee, I think of my childhood and the long drives from rural Appalachia to Chattanooga to see a specialist for my partial blindness. 
I think of TennCare, our state’s Medicaid program, and how I relied on the program again as an adult when I was diagnosed with cancer that almost derailed my future. But most of all, I think of my son who now relies on TennCare to cover his daily caregiving.
Without access to Medicaid, my family may not be here today. And yet, even with coverage, the safety net is already fraying. When Kramer Davis Health — the only clinic in Tennessee specifically designed for adolescents and adults with severe autism and intellectual disabilities — closes its doors this year, families like mine feel this impact immediately. For so many of us, TennCare is the only bridge to the kind of specialized care our loved ones need to survive and thrive.
TennCare supports nearly 1.5 million Tennesseans, funds rural clinics from the Cumberland Plateau to West Tennessee, and sustains vital specialty services like mental health treatments, addiction recovery programs, and care for children with complex medical needs. It also covers nearly half of all children and nearly half of all pregnant mothers in the state. The Medicaid cuts that Congress passed in the reconciliation bill threaten to sever a lifeline for many Tennesseans, especially in rural communities like the one I grew up in.
250k Tennesseans could lose TennCare, private insurance under Congressional spending bill

 Born in rural Appalachia, healthcare was hard to reach for me and even harder to afford. My family depended on TennCare for everything. Because of my blindness, I spent much of my childhood traveling to eye specialists in Chattanooga. Years later, when I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, TennCare helped cover treatment, surgery, and follow-up care. Medicaid gave me back a childhood, allowed me to go to college, and even helped me break the cycle of poverty in my family.
 Today, TennCare is just as essential to my son’s life as it was to mine. He lives with intellectual and developmental disabilities and has relied on a Medicaid waiver his entire life. Now, as an adult, TennCare provides him with the support he needs to live independently. Thanks to Medicaid coverage, my son is able to maintain stable housing, receive daily caregiving, and stay employed. Without it, he would lose everything, including his house, caregiving support, job, and most importantly, ability to thrive independently.
 My Medicaid story spans generations, but the truth is the same: TennCare makes life possible As former director of Family Voices of Tennessee, I worked with families of children with disabilities or special healthcare needs. They turned to us to help navigate therapies, benefit programs, mentorship, and connection. Most of the families we served rely on TennCare because it covers treatments most private insurance companies simply don’t. They simply cannot afford to lose it.
 The recent actions in Washington should concern everyone. The so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”, supported by eight  of Tennessee’s nine-member congressional delegation, would slash Medicaid funding by $7 billion over the next decade. For our state, that means fewer resources for TennCare, the program that underpins healthcare for millions of children, people with disabilities, and rural residents.
 Tennessee already has the highest number of rural hospital closures per capita in the nation, so we know what is at stake. Our state has nine rural hospitals–or 18%– that are at risk of closing with over one-fifth of the state living in such rural areas. Entire counties face the risk of being left without mental health care or other specialty care and services. TennCare is often the only reason providers can keep their doors open. 
Already, we are seeing glimpses of the fallout from these cuts. A rural obstetrician at one of the state’s few remaining birthing hospitals says the system is on the verge of collapse, anticipating women’s and pediatric care likely among the first services to go. Another rural hospital damaged by Hurricane Helene now faces uncertainty about rebuilding and reopening because of reduced federal Medicaid funding under the Big Beautiful bill. If federal funding is slashed, more services will be cut, hospitals will close, and more communities will be left without care.
For families, the impact would be devastating. Imagine a child with autism losing access to speech therapy, a new mother in rural Tennessee who cannot find prenatal care because her local clinic shut down, or an adult with disabilities like my son, who could lose the support that allows him to live independently. Those are not hypotheticals — they are the direct consequences of cutting TennCare.
I’ve seen the Medicaid system from every angle: first, as a patient, then as a mother, and now as a public servant and advocate. I know what it’s like to depend on this program, but more importantly, I know that it continues to deliver essential care to millions. Medicaid gave me the chance to live a healthy life, and now it gives my son — and countless other Tennesseans — the same opportunity.
For families like mine, TennCare is survival. That’s why Congress’s proposed cuts are dangerous: they threaten not just services, but futures. I urge our leaders to remember the Tennessee families whose lives depend on this program and protect TennCare, not weaken it.

(Getty Images)Around 112 scientific grants in Pennsylvania from the National Institutes of Health have been impacted by cuts or freezes instituted by the Trump administration, according to a group of researchers and scientists who have been tracking the terminations.
An estimated 82 are currently affected, with another 30 having possibly been possibly reinstated. Losses are believed to total nearly $40 million. Yet researchers say the impact could extend beyond academia, with scientific grant funding often creating jobs and resulting in boons to local economies.
In August, a U.S. Supreme Court order allowed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to terminate $783 million in grants funding initiatives promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. Last month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to give political appointees even more power to terminate federal grants, including those at the NIH.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The project Grant Witness has found more than 5,100 NIH grants across the country that have been impacted since the administration first began terminating funding en masse in February, resulting in roughly $5.3 billion in losses. The cuts have sometimes left scientists with no way to continue ongoing research or clinical trials.
It says it believes more than 1,300 frozen or terminated grants have been possibly reinstated.
Noam Ross, one of the founders of Grant Witness, which is led by scientists and researchers, began tracking grant terminations around March after he and others who had been doing the same work independently banded together.
“We recognized there was going to need to be an understanding of what was being terminated,” Ross said. “Everything just accelerated from there in terms of the government just became much more large scale and more brazen with its terminations. Things moved from NIH to the [National Science Foundation, or NSF] and more agencies than we’ve been able to cover.”
Ross estimates the group has captured roughly 80% of all NIH grants terminated since the Trump administration cracked down on scientific spending. Data was compiled by scraping government websites, collecting and verifying social media and news reports, and gathering stories from impacted researchers.
The stories and data can sometimes be hard to parse. Ross said tracking has to occur on multiple fronts. That’s because many grants have been frozen and then unfrozen, different federal datasets tracking grant spending have misaligned and it can sometimes take more than a month to see when a grant is reinstated because of a lag in reporting.
“Everyone on the team thinks the American scientific system is a huge, underlying component of what we would say makes this country great, American Prosperity,” Ross said. “The system that we have certainly has its flaws, but it’s done really well for the past almost hundred years. It’s, from our perspective, hugely damaging, discriminatory and probably illegal what the administration is doing to undercut it.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which contains the NIH, did not respond to a request for comment. But officials have said the goal is to align scientific spending with the priorities of the Trump administration.
The NIH calls itself “the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world.”
Impacted grants in Pennsylvania have covered a wide swath of subjects at 16 universities and research institutions, with many, but not all, focused on individual social groups or advancing equity in health care. 
Grant projects include studies ranging from topics such as brain development in children with autism, veterans’ access to organ transplants, racial disparities in kidney failure mortality, uptake in HIV prevention and treatment among transgender women, and efforts to encourage various minority groups to enter scientific fields.










If those opportunities are cut, we’re going to see fewer people who are getting into this pipeline in the first place, and fewer people who have the chance to train as a scientist.


– Allie Sinclair, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School of Medicine


The most affected universities in Pennsylvania were the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and the University of Pittsburgh with 34 and 33, respectively.  Four at the University of Pennsylvania and six at the University of Pittsburgh are listed as “possibly reinstated.”
All but eight of the 112 impacted grants in the commonwealth contained words reportedly flagged by the Trump administration to weed out projects that may be linked to DEI initiatives. They include “bias,” “trans,” “race” and “diverse,” words that sometimes have different meanings in scientific and colloquial contexts. “Trans,” for example, is used as a prefix in chemistry to indicate certain arrangements of atoms in molecules.
Yet even grants that did focus on subjects related to gender or diversity can be important, Ross said. Disparities still exist in health outcomes between people of different ethnicities and social groups. And those differences, he noted, contribute to America’s lagging health indicators and life expectancy when compared to other developed countries.
“That’s the big health science challenge in America these days,” Ross said. “The richest, most well-off communities do as well as any other rich country, but our average health outcomes are much worse because we haven’t figured out how to deliver health care to other communities.”
Cuts may mean fewer people train as scientists
Allie Sinclair, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School of Medicine, worked on NIH-funded projects as a PhD student, and was supported by a fellowship from theNational Science Foundation. 
Like the NIH, the NSF has slashed funding for grant projects under the Trump administration, and that’s also had an effect on schools, research institutions, and their ability to support students in medical science fields.
“This past spring, we saw that universities all over the country were cutting down on the number of PhD students that they were admitting,” Sinclair said. “That’s because PhD students don’t pay tuition out of pocket. Rather, they’re actually paid a stipend to live because they’re really crucial workers in our scientific economy. They’re doing the day-to-day work of science.”
Much of that work is covered by the NIH, but right now, that funding is volatile.
Undergraduate students working on federally-funded projects can get an early chance to do hands-on scientific research. For some, it’s their first exposure to the field. For others, it’s a way to help pay their way through school.
“If those opportunities are cut, we’re going to see fewer people who are getting into this pipeline in the first place, and fewer people who have the chance to train as a scientist,” Sinclair said.
While she wasn’t personally affected by recent grant-funding cuts, Sinclair joined a group of researchers on a project to measure their economic impact. And some of them had their work effectively terminated.

Their research, which led to the creation of a website called Science Impacts, discovered counties across Pennsylvania and the rest of the country may lose millions of dollars in future revenue, all due to the loss of NIH grants and the accompanying jobs and local spending.
It’s based in part on a 2025 study that found NIH grant funding can have a roughly 250% return on investment when it comes to dollars driven into local economies. Mapping jobs lost to scientific grant cuts across the country, and using census data to approximate where researchers may live and spend money, allowed her team to estimate what local economies may lose. They also considered a proposed 40% cut to the NIH’s budget in 2026 to help estimate potential future losses.
“When a university like Penn or Temple or Drexel in the Philadelphia area is impacted by these cuts, the effects will be felt in the surrounding region, not only for people who are right at that institution,” Sinclair told the Capital-Star.
But the impacts won’t just be felt by students and communities around research institutions. Terminated grants, Sinclair said, often represent projects that are already underway.
In most cases, the work was already in progress and then they were abruptly frozen or ended  by the government so the funds are no longer being disbursed,” she said. “Those research projects are disrupted. That can halt clinical trials and things like that.”
Moreover, cuts to scientific grant funding, like the Trump administration’s recent proposal to slash the NIH budget by about 40%, also represents a loss of future research that can lead to all sorts of scientific and medical advancements.
Between 2010 and 2019, over 99% of all drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were created, at least in part, with NIH funding.
“That’s a demonstration that, despite the fact that big pharma and the private sector want to be generating new discoveries, they still really crucially depend on some aspect of federal support for discovering new cures,” Sinclair said. “This sort of broad spectrum investment from the government in health research really leads to tangible benefits for Americans.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-490826621-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 05:59:39.720032

(Getty Images)“If Appalachia is to survive, land reform is a must.” — Jim Branscome, Mountain Eagle (Whitesburg, Kentucky), January 4, 1973
A half-century wait for justice
In early 1973, I wrote those words for the Mountain Eagle of Whitesburg, Kentucky, making the case that nothing could really change for Appalachia’s people — no matter how many government programs or anti-poverty initiatives — until we broke the pattern of absentee land ownership that has defined and damaged our region for more than a century.
Today, 52 years later, much has changed in our mountains, and much, regrettably, remains the same. The coal industry that once promised prosperity has largely collapsed, leaving behind environmental devastation and economic despair. Climate change has brought unprecedented flooding that kills our neighbors and destroys our communities. Yet the fundamental issue I identified five decades ago persists: ordinary mountain people remain “landless in their own country,” while corporate interests control the fate of the best land for housing not subject to flooding, land that can support renewable energy projects, vertical agriculture, carbon credits, and otherwise be the inspiration for new visions by mountaineers of what a post-coal, post-industrial era can look like.
The urgency of this moment cannot be overstated. The catastrophic flooding of July 2022 that killed 45 people in eastern Kentucky, and the many floods since all over coal country, served as a brutal reminder that our current path is unsustainable. Families were swept away in their sleep as waters rose in narrow valleys where safe, buildable land has long been monopolized by coal companies and outside speculators. Meanwhile, on the high ridges above the floodplains, vast tracts of corporate-owned land sit empty or scarred by strip mining.
Meantime, the depopulation of the coalfields continues. Projections from West Virginia University’s Bureau of Business & Economic Research show further steep declines by 2040 across the southern coalfields. McDowell is projected to lose nearly a third of its people (-31.8%), with Summers (-20.2%), Mingo (-19.4%), Wyoming (-18.2%), Boone (-17.1%), Fayette (-16.6%), Logan (-14.4%), Nicholas (-12.1%), Raleigh (-9.5%), Mercer (-8.7%), and even Kanawha (-6.6%) not far behind. Statewide, West Virginia’s population peaked at 2,005,552 in 1950 and fell to 1,793,716 by 2020. In McDowell County alone, population plunged from 98,887 in 1950 to 19,111 in 2020 — a decline of more than 80%.
We’re not just losing numbers — we’re losing the critical mass that keeps communities alive. Shrinking tax bases strain schools and clinics. Volunteer fire and rescue squads struggle to replace aging equipment. Local businesses close earlier, then for good. And after every flood, more families ask if it’s sustainable to rebuild at the bottom of a hollow while idle acreage sits on benches and ridgelines above town. The worst projected decline I have seen is minus 48% for Buchanan County in Southwest Virginia, according to the University of Virginia. Harlan County, Kentucky, is projected to lose nearly 45%, according to the University of Kentucky. The coalfields have a lot more in common than just coal history.
The stranglehold of absentee ownership
No place demonstrates the consequences of absentee ownership more starkly than Southern West Virginia. In the 1990s, journalist Beth Spence led a landmark investigative series, “Who Owns West Virginia?” working with the Appalachian Leadership and Education Foundation. Her research confirmed what people in Mingo, Wyoming, and McDowell counties long suspected: vast acreage and the mineral wealth beneath it were held by a handful of out-of-state corporations and land companies.
Spence found that in some southern West Virginia counties, fewer than a dozen entities owned more than half the private land. In McDowell County, just ten companies owned more than 75% of all private land, rendering local government and residents virtual tenants in their own communities. Over 25% of West Virginia’s surface was held by just ten absentee corporate owners.
While much has changed — coal companies renamed, assets traded and new timber and energy interests seeking short-term profit — the basic reality endures. Nearly half of the state’s surface acreage and most of its mineral rights remain controlled by outside entities rather than local hands.
The costs are visible from Williamson to Bluefield. Land is held off the tax rolls or under-assessed, depriving schools and public services of crucial revenue. Economic development is stymied not by lack of initiative, but by lack of access. Would-be homeowners and small farmers cannot buy or borrow while the best land sits idle or cut-over or stripped. Decisions about land use — whether to strip mine, replant or sell off for speculation — are made from boardrooms in Pittsburgh, Houston or New York, not from courthouse squares in Welch or community meetings in Pineville.
Learning from Kentucky’s bold response
The devastating 2022 floods that claimed 45 lives in eastern Kentucky sparked an unprecedented response from Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration. Rather than simply rebuilding in the same flood-prone valleys, Kentucky launched an ambitious program to create new high-ground communities on safer ridgetop locations. The state is acquiring land, building infrastructure and offering families the chance to relocate to elevated sites that could withstand future floods. There are no reasons West Virginia cannot do the same.
Beshear’s efforts represent exactly the kind of bold, land-focused thinking that West Virginia desperately needs. Beshear’s approach recognizes that climate resilience requires fundamentally rethinking where and how we build communities. It acknowledges that the old pattern — of families crowded into narrow valleys while corporations control the high ground — is not just unjust but deadly.
West Virginia faces the same climate threats that devastated eastern Kentucky.  The narrow valleys flood regularly, and climate scientists warn that extreme precipitation events will only intensify. Yet we continue to allow the safest, most buildable land to remain in corporate hands while families crowd into flood-prone areas.
Tools for transformation
The mechanisms for change exist today in ways they didn’t in 1973. Community land trusts have proven successful across Appalachia, from the Woodland Community Land Trust in Tennessee to similar efforts in Kentucky and West Virginia. These organizations keep land accessible for housing, farming and business while protecting it from speculation and corporate takeover.
Land banks have become vehicles for returning tax-delinquent or abandoned coal lands to community use. Environmental cleanup programs offer opportunities to acquire and remediate damaged lands. Federal infrastructure investments provide unprecedented resources for rural development.
Most importantly, millions of dollars in federal and state funding are now flowing into West Virginia for mine reclamation, broadband infrastructure and climate adaptation. This represents a historic opportunity to reshape land ownership patterns while building resilient communities. The state could begin with a $100 million demonstration project using funding available from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
An Appalachian Homestead Act
My proposal for a modern Appalachian Homestead Act would harness these resources to finally address the land question that has plagued our region for generations. The state would acquire tax-delinquent, bankruptcy, and underused corporate acreage, particularly in the southern coalfields with the most concentrated absentee ownership.
These lands would be redistributed as 10-to-40-acre homesteads to local families, returnees, and new settlers committed to adding value to the community. Each plot would come with tax relief and essential infrastructure, from broadband to flood-resistant siting on high ground. Homesteads would be part of community land trusts or similar shared-ownership models, protecting against outside speculation while preserving individual autonomy over homes and improvements.
New landowners could plant orchards, vineyards or native hardwoods. They could build farm stays, small mills or food businesses. They could sell carbon credits, harvest wild ginseng or develop renewable energy projects. Most importantly, they could live on and live from their own land in communities designed for climate resilience rather than corporate extraction.
West Virginia University and the state’s other colleges could provide technical assistance not just for industrial agriculture, but for small-scale, diversified, locally rooted economies. Extension agents could help new landowners navigate everything from sustainable forestry to agritourism to renewable energy development.
The moment of decision
As West Virginia stands at another crossroads, the choice is clear: decline by inertia, tolerate the continued depopulation of Southern West Virginia, or renewal through justice. The tools exist. The money is finally arriving. The political will, fueled by necessity and decades of local organizing, is growing.
The 2022 Kentucky floods reminded us that our current land use patterns are not just economically unjust but physically dangerous. Beshear’s response shows that bold action is possible when leaders prioritize people over corporate interests. West Virginia can learn from Kentucky’s example while charting its own course toward land justice.  Nothing is more American than homesteading. Conservatives can cherish local initiative and private property values; progressives can celebrate meaningful change that did not happen with previous poorly funded economic development projects.
Fifty years ago, I argued that Appalachia’s future would be decided by who owned the land and how it was used. No area bears this out more clearly than Southern West Virginia. The land — and its people — have waited long enough for justice. With bold land reform, the Mountain State can become a model not only for Central Appalachia but for rural renewal across the country.
The choice belongs to this generation of West Virginians. The land remembers those who fought for it. History will judge whether we had the courage to finally claim it for our people.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)MOREHEAD — In a warehouse in Rowan County sits an experiment that Tom Manning-Beavin and his nonprofit have been brainstorming for years — a wooden rectangular frame he calls one of their “boxes.” 
When the Frontier Housing CEO explains the concept, he hearkens back to when he played with Lego bricks growing up. Just like a Lego toy set, the boxes are put together to make the “building blocks of a house.”

“I remember when you got a box of Legos and there wasn’t a prescribed thing to build, and my brother and I would build stuff,” Manning-Beavin said.
What Manning-Beavin is hoping to tackle now is the stark shortfall of affordable housing in Eastern Kentucky by reinventing the way the nonprofit has been building homes for 51 years. 
Instead of constructing a house on site from the ground up, he and his colleagues want to manufacture their component “boxes” in a factory and transport them to the site, where they could become a finished  house much more quickly and at lower cost, while still maintaining the sturdiness and quality of traditionally built homes.
That would be in contrast to the vast majority of single-family homes across the country that are “site-built,” meaning all the materials are brought to a site where workers turn them into a house.

A world of ‘boxes’ 
In the warehouse, Manning-Beavin points out a “wet box” where water is hooked up for a bathroom, laundry space and kitchen. From there, a “suite box” with a master bedroom could be added onto the “wet box.” A “kids box” could be added with two small bedrooms for children. The “boxes” could be mixed and matched depending on homebuyers’ needs, ranging from 576 square feet with two boxes to over 1,400 square feet.with five boxes. 
The factory-made boxes would be built with the same materials, same tools and to the same code as traditional “stick-built” homes, he said.  
“It is like building a car on an assembly line,” Manning-Beavin said. “I think what this does is it creates a lot of flexibility for the buyer, creates choice. It also creates simplicity and replicability in the factory.”

The Morehead nonprofit  is adopting the modular housing concept, called a DreamBuild, from a Texas nonprofit builder. Come Build, Come Dream in Texas launched its version of DreamBuild homes to offer families more choice in the design of affordable housing. It’s a level of buyers’ choice that Manning-Beavin hopes to bring to Eastern Kentucky and that is largely unavailable in other types of factory-built housing. 
Manning-Beavin said Frontier Housing’s board agreed to take on the concept in the summer of 2023, and the nonprofit received funding from the James Graham Brown Foundation last year to continue to build prototypes.
The housing shortage in Eastern Kentucky has been exacerbated by catastrophic flooding in recent years. Fahe, a network of more than 50 nonprofits across Appalachia including Frontier Housing, has set an ambitious goal of rehabilitating or building 60,000 homes through 2030 — double its normal pace.
Meanwhile, the rising cost to build a house also is driving the region’s housing shortage, says Manning-Beavin.
After the 2022 flooding, Manning-Beavin started to see DreamBuild as “part of the solution for providing homes at a pace that was needed.”

“Lots of people just in Rowan County …  are frustrated because they want to own a house, there’s nothing to buy, and we can’t afford to build a house at a price point that they can afford,” Manning-Beavin said. “Our hope is that we start to change that equation, not just in Rowan County but across Eastern Kentucky, and perhaps parts of West Virginia, parts of Virginia, parts of Ohio.” 
Housing costs — and a ‘dream’ to lower them
Generally, he said, the costs to construct traditionally built homes exceed the home’s value, even though traditional financing offers a loan covering only the value of a home. It’s a trend seen nationwide for a number of reasons ranging from the costs of regulation to rising land values to  the costs of materials, effectively disincentivizing the construction of affordable homes because developers know they will lose money on them. 
Manning-Beavin said the Kentucky Housing Corporation, a quasi-governmental corporation that distributes federal housing monies, has offered Frontier Housing subsidies to cover the gap between the cost of building a home and its value.

The hope is that DreamBuild homes can be made efficiently and quickly enough to cut down construction costs by about 10% to 15%. Then, Frontier Housing could break even on building a home without subsidies and open up access to more traditional house financing such as through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
Manning-Beavin is confident they can get there, pointing to experience of fine-tuning the construction of energy-efficient homes in Whitley County with the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corp. 
But plenty of growing pains await the nonprofit as they perfect their model.

“It’s going to be one of the things that’s going to ramp up,” said Tod Barhorst, the director of construction at the nonprofit. “We’ve kind of been really baby-crawling right now.” 
The nonprofit has had to build prototypes of the various “box” types, dismantle the boxes and rebuild again to see what works and what doesn’t. One challenge is getting state code enforcement approval for designs without having to get approval for each different version of box types being put together. 
Another challenge: how to effectively transport the boxes, especially with Kentucky’s lower height limit for vehicle loads compared to Texas, where the DreamBuild concept started. 
Barhorst said the nonprofit also wants to distinguish its product from other manufactured housing, emphasizing the DreamBuild homes’ “stick-built” quality. 
“A lot of questions to answer, a lot of things to work out,” Barhorst said.

Painting the final touches
The project has the potential to significantly increase the number of homes it can build if the project succeeds. The nonprofit is aiming to build 12 traditional “stick-built” homes this year. In contrast, the nonprofit believes it could produce around 60 DreamBuild homes or more every year.
Frontier Housing has leased a 55,000 square foot building in Martin County to ramp up production of DreamBuild housing, including duplexes for a 50-unit apartment complex in Maysville. Manning-Beavin said the Maysville project will use 152 boxes. He also hopes to build and send DreamBuild homes to the Skyview higher ground community in Perry County. 
For now, a glimpse of what’s possible can be found along Redbud Circle near the Bath County line. Inside one of two prototype homes, there are windows with lots of light pouring in. A master bedroom with a full bathroom. A kitchen with new appliances. A large porch with a gravel driveway.

It’s not until Hunter Plank points out small, nearly unnoticeable details along the walls that where the “boxes” were put together become visible. 
Plank, who went from building more traditional homes for Frontier Housing to building these DreamBuild homes, said the home is “double built” in some ways, especially around where two boxes come together. The prototype homes are planned to be energy efficient; the first finished DreamBuild home is roughly 50% more energy efficient than an average home, according to one rating system. 
“There’s no corners cut,” Plank said. 
On an afternoon in August, Plank and his co-workers were busy painting the place.
“The idea isn’t for you to think about how it was built. That’s our problem. You’re just getting a home,” Plank said.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Electricity customers across a broad swath of the country will bear the costs of running an outdated fossil fuel power plant in Pennsylvania that federal energy regulators pulled back from the brink of retirement earlier this year.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) last month approved a plan that allows PJM Interconnection to recover its payments to the plant’s owner, Constellation Energy, from electricity users across its 13-state territory.
Environmental and renewable energy advocates and stakeholders in the regional electric grid opposed the system-wide cost sharing plan, arguing that it would unfairly raise electricity bills in areas that see little benefit from the old plant remaining online. 
The groups, including the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), say the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) claim of an emergency as the reason for keeping the plant online doesn’t exist. 
The agency last month extended its order requiring the plant in suburban Philadelphia and another in southwest Michigan to keep operating for a total of 180 days beyond their planned shut down dates. 
Opponents warn that it will add to soaring energy costs for consumers and prevent badly needed new electricity generators from connecting to the grid. The groups say the regulatory interventions used to keep the plant running and spread out the costs will be used in the future as U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright executes the administration’s fossil fuel-first energy policy.
Wright, a former oil drilling and mining company executive, has described the future of coal as “long and bright.”

“There are like 40 coal plants that are supposed to close this year, and our biggest impact is going to be to stop the closure of most of those,” Wright said in July during a visit to the National Energy Technology Laboratory in Morgantown, West Virginia.
In an MSNBC interview in June, he said peak electricity demands and growing consumption are driving the need to keep older power plants running.
The Trump administration and other Republicans, including Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick have framed the continued use of coal and other fossil fuels as crucial to developing artificial intelligence technologies superior to China’s.
“We need to stop digging the hole, keep working power plants open today, and do everything we can in the regulatory framework to allow new capacity to be added to our grid so we can lead in the AI race,” Wright said in the interview.
Rachel Gleason, executive director of the Pennsylvania Coal Alliance, said fossil fuel generation remains essential to electric reliability in the commonwealth. The commonwealth’s net electricity generation decreased from 39% in 2013 to about 5% in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.
She noted two of the commonwealth’s remaining “workhorse” coal power plants, the Keystone Generating Station in Armstrong County and the Conemaugh Generating Station in Indiana County, each capable of producing more than 1,500 megawatts, were essential during recent spells of arctic cold and a June heatwave.

“Keeping all of the available capacity we need online rather than prematurely shuttering it will be essential for energy security, grid reliability, and mitigating price pressures that will otherwise continue to escalate for ratepayers,” she said.
Environmental groups noted in a filing opposing PJM’s cost sharing plan that while it called on Constellation’s Eddystone Generating Station in Delaware County to run during the June heatwave, it wasn’t because of a shortage of electricity. PJM exported power to other regional systems in the midwest and New York during that time.
In their protest of PJM’s cost allocation plan for Eddystone, the groups said the plant’s generators ran less than 1% of the time from 2020 to 2023.
“There is no need for this plant to continue operating,” Jessi Eidbo, senior advisor at the Sierra Club, said. “We’re waiting for a compelling reason and one is not emerging.”
The cost of keeping Eddystone online, estimated at nearly $70 million annually according to a report by the power industry consulting firm Grid Strategies, may not be noticeable when it’s spread across PJM’s 65 million customers, Greg Wannier, senior counsel at the Sierra Club, said. But prolonging the life of more gas, oil and coal plants that operators are ready to shut down will cause costs to mount, he said.
“The Trump administration has made very clear that they are going to issue an order to every coal plant that is going to retire in the next few years,” he said. “Were they allowed to do that for four years, the cost for consumers very quickly would go up.”
The Grid Strategies study projected the cost of keeping retiring power plants online to be between $3 billion and $6 billion nationwide by 2029.
Watchdog agencies in each state have warned of the potential impact on consumers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Since the DOE issued the initial order for Eddystone, the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission has been involved in the stakeholder process PJM launched to determine how to allocate the cost of keeping the plant in operation, Chairman Stephen DeFrank said in a statement to the Capital-Star. He noted Pennsylvania doesn’t have an energy shortage and exports power to neighboring states.
“Our concern is making sure Pennsylvania families and businesses are not forced to shoulder the cost of power shortages in other states,” DeFrank said. “While the added expense from Eddystone may be modest right now, if this becomes a pattern with larger plants, the price tag for consumers could grow quickly — and those costs should fall more heavily on the regions that actually need the extra power.”
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is challenging the DOE’s order to keep the Campbell plant running in federal court. Her office also intervened in a request by the plant’s owner, Consumers Energy Co. to recover the cost, arguing that the DOE exceeded its authority and that requiring electric utility customers to pay is unjustified.
A spokesperson for Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday didn’t respond to questions about the DOE and FERC’s actions on the Eddystone plant. The DOE also didn’t respond to the Capital-Star’s questions.
PJM said in a statement that it has documented its concerns about demand growth and power plant retirements leading to serious ramifications for reliability and affordability. It called the agency’s recent order extending the Eddystone plant’s operation, “a prudent, time-limited step.”
Constellation, which emphasizes its role in accelerating a transition to a clean energy economy, said it’s working with the DOE and PJM “to meet the need for power at this critical time when America must win the AI race.” 
Constellation and PJM did not respond to questions about the cost of keeping the Eddystone plant operational.
Wannier, the Sierra Club attorney, said because Eddystone and Campbell’s retirements were already planned, the plants were not part of the auction processes  their respective grid operators used to establish the prices for generating capacity. 
Jon Gordon, director of the electricity industry group Advanced Energy United, said that puts their owners in an advantageous position to negotiate an agreement to be ready to run when needed.
“It’s really the most expensive way to meet resource needs for ratepayers,” Gordon said.
Ready to retire
Eddystone Generating Station in Delaware County was built in the late 1950s and burned coal, initially. Standing on the Delaware River waterfront about two miles from Philadelphia International Airport, its brightly illuminated smokestacks were a landmark on the suburban skyline for decades. Its location, on the border of the city of Chester, is close to one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
The original coal-fired units were retired about 15 years ago, but two 380 megawatt oil- or natural gas-burning units installed in the late 1960s remain operational, along with four smaller oil burning units used only during peak demand, according to Constellation. (A single megawatt for an hour is roughly the amount of electricity used by 500 to 1,000 homes for the same amount of time.)
Constellation had planned to retire the plant at the end of May following a lengthy process in which it sought and received approval from PJM. The regional grid operator, which manages the supply of electricity across its territory from New Jersey to Illinois, determined that taking Eddystone out of service would not affect reliability of the power grid.
In an emergency order on May 30, the Energy Department used its authority under the Federal Power Act to direct PJM and Constellation to ensure that Eddystone was ready to run for 90 days beyond its retirement date. In the order, Wright cited growing concern that “available generation capacity may fall short of required reserves” in an extreme scenario.
The order cited a May 2 news release from PJM that stated despite concerns about future capacity, “adequate resources” were available to meet the grid’s demand during the summer, when electricity use peaks. During a heat wave, on July 23, the grid’s electricity load reached 160,560 megawatts, its highest since 2006.

The DOE in May also ordered PJM counterpart Mid-Continent Independent System Operator, which runs the grid for 15 states and Manitoba, to ensure that the coal-fueled J.H. Campbell Power Plant in Michigan remains available for operation for 90 days past its planned retirement.
Last month, the DOE extended the orders requiring both Eddystone and Campbell to remain ready to produce power through mid-November.
Casey Roberts, an attorney at the NRDC working to oppose the emergency orders, said it’s clear the Trump administration is using the DOE’s emergency powers to put its energy policy into effect. 
Exploding demand
On the day he was inaugurated, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy” encouraging domestic energy exploration and production to establish the United States as a “global energy leader.” It called for the elimination of policies that would burden domestic energy development and revoked a dozen Biden administration orders on clean energy and climate change mitigation.
Roberts said the orders to keep Eddystone and Campbell running differ from those issued by the DOE over the previous two decades. 
Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act gives the Department of Energy authority to order actions by electric generators or grid operators in response to sudden increased demand or shortage of electricity.
Eidbo, of the Sierra Club, noted that between 2000 and 2022, the DOE used its Section 202(c) power only a dozen times. This year it has issued seven orders, four of which relate to Eddystone and Campbell. 
The other three involve an extreme weather event in North Carolina and ongoing reliability issues in Puerto Rico. 
“Those are all really focused. They have a strong factual basis. There is a short-term emergency,” Roberts said, noting the orders for Eddystone and Campbell point to future conditions in which there could be a shortfall. “Neither of these regions have an ongoing adequacy crisis.”
Demand for electricity is growing as a result of increased electrification of transportation and industry but primarily due to the proliferation of data centers housing computer equipment to run internet streaming services, cloud computing and power artificial intelligence. 
PJM predicts that its peak demand will grow by about 70,000 megawatts to 220,000 megawatts by 2040. 
New generating capacity has been slow to come online because of a backlog of new projects waiting for PJM approval to connect to the grid.

As a result, PJM has negotiated its own deals with power plant operators to keep older plants online to meet capacity demands. In January it reached an agreement with Talen Energy to operate two Maryland oil- and natural gas-fired plants past their retirement dates. 
Gordon, of Advanced Energy United, said on-demand generation saved the day during heatwaves this summer. Gleason, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Coal Alliance, said coal fired generation more than doubled from 14.5 gigawatts to 31 gigawatts.
From the industry’s perspective, Gordon said, the concern about future capacity is a problem of PJM’s own making.
“PJM has just utterly failed in this process to get new projects online,” Gordon said.
The queue for new projects has been closed since 2022. While FERC has ordered PJM to make changes to make the process faster and more transparent, nearly 9,300 requests are pending, mostly for renewable energy sources, according to the utility information tracking website interconnection.fyi.
Electricity customers in PJM’s territory saw their electric bills spike this summer as a result of the tightening market. Gov. Josh Shapiro filed a complaint with FERC late last year claiming the higher costs were unjustified because new projects would not come online in time to meet the demand. It resulted in a settlement that capped the rate for this past summer’s auction, but prices still jumped nearly 22%.
Gordon said that’s a clear economic signal for producers to build new power plants, solar and wind farms and battery storage facilities. But the Trump administration’s energy policy, including a permitting freeze, elimination of tax credits and stop-work orders for wind projects, is getting in the way, he said.
“You have this administration striking down wind to keep these plants running,” Gordon said, “which doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC_9533-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 05:59:39.720032

(Getty Images)Poverty is down in Kentucky, new federal data shows, though the percent of Kentuckians living in poverty exceeds the national rate and the state is the nation’s 46th poorest.
The American Community Survey (ACS), released by the United States Census Bureau last week, shows 15.6% of Kentuckians lived in poverty last year, more than the 10.6% rate in the United States. That’s an improvement from 2023, when 16.4% of Kentuckians lived in poverty. 
Child poverty levels are at 19%, down from 22% four years ago. Kentuckians also made more money in 2024 than in 2023. The state’s median household income was $64,526. That lags national median income by about $16,000 but is up from $61,118 in 2023.
Within Kentucky, disparities persist across racial groups and regions. Median income for Kentucky’s Black households was $47,881 in 2024, compared with $66,749 for white households. The poverty rate for people in Eastern Kentucky’s 5th Congressional District was 24.3% in 2024, compared to 15.6% for the state as a whole, reports the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy.
Matthew H. Ruther
While incomes have risen so have costs, especially for housing. Matthew H. Ruther, the director of the Kentucky State Data Center and a University of Louisville professor, said housing costs “have been increasing faster than other elements of other typical expenditures, and they’re a huge part of — particularly poor — families’ budgets.” 
The median gross rent in Kentucky was around $998, lower than the national average of just under $1,500.
And though senior citizens (65 and older) are the least likely group to live in poverty, Ruther said, the data shows poverty levels in this age group in Kentucky increased in recent years from 12% to 13%. 
Patience Martin, a state policy fellow for the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said the “slight progress” on several data points is “obviously, not sufficient enough.” The positive changes in 2024 were likely due to specific post-pandemic shifts, Martin said. 
“The economy had become strong due to all of the COVID-19 stimulus funds, and there were a lot of federal job-creating investments specifically in things like infrastructure and clean energy,” she told the Lantern. “So that … unique boom in spending in the economy in 2024 did kind of pave the way for these improvements to be made.”

Recent federal changes made by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and Gov. Andy Beshear’s recent forecast that tax revenues could fall short of budgeted expectations in this fiscal year raise concerns that these American Community Survey numbers could worsen in the future, she said. 
“We are certain that these new policies will present new hardships and undermine what progress we have made as a state,” Martin said. 
Ruther shares some concern, saying the law is “not going to be good for lower income individuals.” 
Meanwhile, education levels for Kentuckians lag behind the nation, which is “certainly related” to income levels, Ruther said. In 2024, the American Community Survey shows, about 28% of Kentuckians had at least a bachelor’s degree, compared with 37% across the country.

Dan McKee, left, and his 2026 Democratic primary rival Helena Bounanno Foulkes, right, are already bickering over Rhode Island's opioid crisis. (Left photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current; right photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)It didn’t take long. 
On the same day Helena Foulkes launched her second gubernatorial run, Gov. Dan McKee’s campaign team released a 60-second digital ad titled “She Knew.” The ad accused CVS of fueling the opioid crisis during Foulkes’ tenure as president of the pharmacy division, and it strongly implied that Foulkes had specifically profited from this. 
“Not all drug deals look alike” the ad’s narrator says, as images of powders, pills, and cash flash onscreen. The ad echoed a line of attack from McKee and Foulke’s first Democratic-primary showdown in 2022.
In response, Foulkes told WPRI’s Ted Nesi that, on her watch, CVS pharmacy reduced its dispensing of opioids by almost 40%, and specifically stopped filling scripts for 600 “pill mill docs.” She said the pharmacy completed a massive drug take-back campaign and partnered with other drugstores to pursue legislation to reduce the number of pills patients received after minor surgery.  And as for McKee’s not-so-subtle suggestion that she was a drug dealer?
 “I think the governor is either attacking our biggest companies or losing our biggest companies,” Foulkes said. “And this is what you do when you’re a desperate man and you know you haven’t done anything for the people of Rhode Island.”   
There it was: The 2026 governor’s race was only hours old, and the conversation had already turned to opioids.
As both a longtime reporter on Rhode Island politics, and the author of a nonfiction book about the opioid epidemic — specifically, a “pill mill doc” of the kind Foulkes referenced in her Nesi interview — I watched this uneasily. 
The scale of the opioid crisis is staggering: according to the CDC, more than 800,000 people died from an opioid overdose between 1999 and 2023.  The amount of pain and grief caused by this problem defies comprehension. It’s a subject that ought to be approached with tact, care, and precision. I worry that in the coming months we’ll see it reduced to mere point-scoring political fodder. 
They didn’t ask me, but I have some advice for what the candidates — and the rest of Rhode Island — should keep in mind as we embark on a bitterly fought campaign where overdoses are a key issue.










The 2026 governor’s race was only hours old, and the conversation had already turned to opioids.


None of what follows is an attempt to shield Foulkes from scrutiny over her record at the helm of CVS Pharmacy. CVS, like Walgreens, has agreed to pay billions to settle lawsuits over its role in the opioid epidemic. More recently, the Department of Justice sued CVS for what it described as years of knowingly filling illegitimate prescriptions. That lawsuit, which covers activity beginning in 2013, includes the four years Foulkes was at the helm of CVS pharmacy, from 2014 to 2018. It’s entirely fair to ask Foulkes about this and let her answer those questions.
But this is a public health crisis that can be influenced by the things our leaders say and the policies they enact. So here are a few points for the candidates to keep in mind as ever-larger audiences tune in to what they’re saying.
1. The human toll should be centered in any conversation about overdoses. People who struggle with substance use are discriminated against while they’re alive, and then treated as lifeless statistics after death. It’s a cliche at this point to note that every person who dies from an overdose was someone’s child, someone’s sibling, someone’s parent, someone’s friend. But it’s necessary because of the pernicious stigma they face. Like thousands of people in Rhode Island, I know someone in the state who died from an overdose. I have seen the agony etched on their family members’ faces at the funeral service. And I know the unceasing pain that those folks still carry. To McKee and Foulkes, I’d ask, “Are you speaking in a way that honors this pain or cheapens it?” They would be wise to discuss drug use as if they’re in the presence of someone who’s grieving a loved one’s overdose or actively battling substance use themselves. 
2. This crisis is ongoing. In 2024, the last year for which we have complete data, 329 Rhode Islanders died from overdoses. And you only have to go back to 2023 to see that rate surpass an average of one death per day.  That’s not to say this is the same crisis of 2005 or 2010 or 2015 or 2020. As the CDC notes, what began as a pill problem became a heroin problem, then became a fentanyl problem. In recent years, researchers have written that a problem once dubbed the opioid epidemic is now “a polysubstance-overdose death crisis.” Accurate communication about life-and-death matters of public health is important for a governor. When speaking about overdoses, they should communicate that this isn’t over and it isn’t the same problem it was a decade ago.
3. Political punch-throwing about overdoses does little to stop them. It wastes precious air time that could be used to actually combat the issue. Clearly, McKee and Foulkes both have points they want to make; I’m not going to suggest they stop talking about it. But whenever possible, they should focus on messaging that’s in the public interest, not just their own. Public health advocates could only dream of the kind of airtime that McKee and Foulkes will have in the coming months. So the candidates could use it to remind Rhode Islanders that Substance Use Disorder is an illness, not a moral failure, and that folks affected by this problem deserve dignity and compassion. They could point people to the wonderful Prevent Overdose RI website. They could call for wider access to life-saving harm reduction tools, like naloxone, fentanyl test strips, and sterile needles. They could urge more cities and towns to open Overdose Prevention Centers like the groundbreaking one that launched last year in Providence. They could discuss the ways they’ll make it easier for any Rhode Islander, in any financial situation, to access treatment.
One of the only potential benefits of the politicization of overdoses is if it sparks a competition for the most aggressive plan to address them.
Now, I’m not naive. I don’t foresee McKee and Foulkes avoiding the subjects of opioids and overdoses any time soon. But how they discuss this issue matters. 
It is, in fact, its own test of leadership.

Richardson, who served as president of Morgan State University during a period of rapid growth and advancement, from 1984 to 2010, died Sept. 13, 2025, the university announced. ()Photo courtesy Morgan State University)Earl S. Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who helped organize a 2006 lawsuit against the state of Maryland for providing more resources to predominantly white institutions that ended in a $577 million settlement, died at the age of 81.
The school released a statement Saturday about the death of Richardson, who served as president from November 1984 to June 2010. A school spokesman said in an email that after he stepped down as president, Richardson remained at the institution for several years and taught a graduate-level course, when he held the title president emeritus.
“Dr. Richardson’s commitment to excellence and his ability to inspire confidence restored faith in the University at a time when its future was uncertain,” said Morgan State President David K. Wilson in a statement. “He leaves behind a legacy of perseverance, innovation, and an unshakable belief in the transformative power of education.
“On a personal note, I am deeply humbled to have followed in the presidency after Dr. Richardson’s tenure,” Wilson said. “The foundation he built allowed us to continue Morgan’s upward trajectory, and much of what we have achieved in recent years is possible because of the strong platform he left behind.”
Richardson was the force behind the 15-year legal fight that got settled in 2021 when the state agreed to direct $577 million over the next decade to Morgan and the state’s other three Historically Black Colleges and Universities – Bowie State and Coppin universities and the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore.
The suit claimed the state provided more resources to predominantly white institutions and allowed them to duplicate programs already offered at the four Black schools.

Because Richardson a state employee, as president of Morgan, he couldn’t sue the school. So a group of HBCU alumni and supporters became plaintiffs in the suit and formed the Coalition for Equity and Excellence in Maryland Higher Education Inc.
In addition, a group known as the Maryland HBCU advocates also pushed publicly on the importance of those schools in the state.
Sharon Blake, a 1972 Morgan State alumna and member of the HBCU advocacy group, said Richardson’s “history, vision and passion” served as the catalyst for why the settlement happened and helped all HBCUs nationwide. In addition, she said he understood those schools after graduating from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. When he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in social science in 1965, the school was called Maryland State College.
“I remember when we talked about starting the advocacy piece, I said to Dr. Richardson, ‘If you’re serious about moving forward on this public piece, I’m going to go down with the ship,’” Blake said in an interview Saturday. “We saw the love and the passion that Dr. Richardson had. [His death] is a tremendous loss for our society and Morgan State University.”
Several people posted messages on social media including Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and Gov. Wes Moore (D), who called Richardson “a pillar of Maryland and the Morgan State University community.”
Le Shaun Quander-Mosley, also a member of the Maryland HBCU advocacy group, said the work to fight for those schools continues.
Two years after the settlement, Wilson and other HBCU advocates accused Towson University of creating and duplicating a business analytics doctoral program that was similar a business administration doctoral program at Morgan. Towson eventually withdrew its proposal.
Last year, the General Assembly approved legislation that revised the program-approval progress when higher education officials want to establish new programs at state universities. Part of that included the Maryland Higher Education Commission approving bylaws for a 21-member Program Review Process Advisory Council to make sure processes are “practical, efficient, and transparent.”
“Dr. Richardson helped bring things to light. We’ve done taking the steps to adjust the laws, but now we have to look at practice [and] make sure that everyone is doing what the law requires,” Quander-Mosley said. “He meant everything to HBCUs in Maryland in the state of Maryland. His example emanates across the country to other HBCUs.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/54784428689_3b0542df1d_o-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-09-15 05:59:39.720032

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Gov. Sarah Sanders’ quest to build a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County has been so beset with shifting explanations, tactical missteps and public relations blunders that it’s hard to imagine administration officials could do anything to make matters worse.
Until they did.
In a decision both mystifying and arrogant in equal measure, the governor’s office decided not to send any of her senior staff to defend the prison project at a hearing held last week by the legislature’s Joint Performance Review Committee — including Joe Profiri, the prison guru Sanders brought from Arizona as her first corrections secretary and who parachuted into a role as senior adviser in her office when he was fired by the Board of Corrections.
After opponents of the Franklin County prison spent more than an hour offering a detailed and devastating critique of the prison site selection process, two lower-level Sanders administration officials were sent to twist in the wind, at times struggling to answer questions they said were “not in our lane” or “not our role” and occasionally making admissions that were less than helpful to the governor’s cause.
Profiri was not just a no-show; the governor’s office didn’t even respond to lawmakers’ invitation for him to testify, according to the committee’s co-chair, Sen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron, who tried unsuccessfully to get his colleagues to issue a subpoena: “I think it is a slap at this body not to even answer us and say he cannot be here.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, at a hearing on the Franklin County prison on Sept. 9, 2025. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)
Noting that he had seen Profiri in the Capitol earlier in the day, prison critic Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, was even more biting: “It looks like we’ve got a better chance to get Jeffrey Epstein here to talk about child sex trafficking than we do Mr. Profiri, who’s paid almost a quarter million dollars a year in salary and benefits.” (Profiri’s salary is $189,210.94, according to the state’s transparency website.)

Clearly perturbed, Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, suggested that “we need to let them know over there [in the governor’s office] … that he is either going to come over here, or we’re going to take his pay away.”
Profiri’s murky role in the Franklin County prison was highlighted later in the hearing when two Board of Corrections members who voted to fire him — Benny Magness and Lee Watson — testified that he had stopped communicating with them, although administration staffers working the project appear to be relying on information he provided.
“We don’t give [Profiri] anything to do,” Watson said. “We have almost no communication with him and have had no communication.”
Whoever made the tactical mistake to have Profiri skip the hearing ensured that news coverage would focus on his absence. For Sanders, it was a lost opportunity to defend the centerpiece of her incarceration-forward criminal justice strategy and try to quiet rising skepticism among legislators.
“I’m trying to figure out a way to vote for the appropriation, and all I do is get further and further and further away,” said Sen. Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, after he tried and failed to get a cost estimate for water infrastructure upgrades required for the site.

Watson and Magness also pointed out the irony that the governor’s inability to move the project forward — because of a controversy of her own making that she’s making worse — is getting in the way of her stated goal of increasing prison beds to alleviate a backlog of state prisoners in county jails.
Indeed, administration officials admitted at the hearing that no effort is currently being made to find an alternate site, calling into question whether any new prison will be up and running before Sanders leaves office.
The two administration officials who testified at the hearing — Anne Laidlaw, director of the Division of Building Authority, and Shelby Johnson, a geographer who heads the geographic information services office — did not take the opportunity to present a detailed response to the presentation by prison opponents, but they did answer legislators’ questions.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)
While both were involved in the site selection process, they were clearly less equipped to speak to details that went beyond their narrow remit, as Profiri presumably would have been. And Laidlaw and Johnson continued to insist, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary, that the Franklin County site is viable and the process used to select it was sound.
At times, that required suppression of incredulity.
Johnson told Wooten the Franklin County location met the site selection criteria for water infrastructure because an 8-inch water pipeline nearby could be extended to the site, based on information from the Arkansas Department of Health. But he conceded that he didn’t know if Fort Smith or Ozark had enough water to put in the main (both have said they don’t), and that wells on the property were drilled after it was selected as the prison site.
“It wasn’t my role to approve the site. We were making a recommendation for the site,” Johnson said.
Making their argument against the prison, Gravel & Grit founders Adam Watson and Natalie Cadena from the Franklin County and River Valley Coalition pointed out that the chosen site did not meet many of the criteria set out before the search began. That prompted Johnson to explain that those criteria were merely a tool to narrow the search and did not necessarily preclude sites that didn’t meet them.
Watson also accused administration officials of “watering down” the criteria to fit the parcel of land they decided to purchase, which he said was “the opposite of due diligence.” Laidlaw and Johnson insisted they were not pressured by anyone to try to make the site work.
But just as they couldn’t speak to macro-level details about the prison project, they also can’t speak to what pressure might have been applied higher up the food chain. Indeed, the assertion that the site selection wasn’t being reverse engineered would have been more credible had it come from Profiri or perhaps one of Sanders’ cabinet secretaries.
During her testimony, Laidlaw also mentioned working with the Department of Corrections in planning the project, which drew this rather pointed clarification from Magness: “When she said she was talking to DOC, I can only assume that she was talking to [Profiri] because he wasn’t including us in all those conversations or those decisions.”
Rice said he and his committee co-chair, Rep. Bruce Cozart, R-Hot Springs, called the hearing for the sake of “transparency,” after opponents of the prison submitted a formal complaint with more than 1,200 signatures, reflecting the level of concern in Franklin County.
By not taking the hearing seriously or sending officials equipped to answer legitimate issues raised by the well-sourced, factual presentation from opponents, the Sanders administration once again showed its disregard for both public sentiment and legislators who dare to ask impertinent questions.
Meanwhile, nearly a year had gone by since the governor sprang her prison site on the unsuspecting residents of Franklin County, and she’s no closer to turning the first shovel of dirt.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Louisville Metro Government created an Office of Inspector General in 2021 in response to a number of high-profile breaches of public trust committed by the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD). 
The tragic police shooting of Breonna Taylor in March of 2020 laid bare the need for widespread reforms and for better oversight from outside the police department. The goal of an inspector general’s office is to help restore community faith in policing and ensure shared police accountability by offering an independent review of alleged wrongdoings by police officers.
Ed Harness, a seasoned attorney and former Milwaukee police officer who spent six years building Albuquerque’s civilian oversight system, was chosen in late 2021 to lead that office. His appointment was grounded in a blend of law enforcement experience, legal acumen, dedication to reform and an ability to communicate across differences.
Since then, Harness has brought real momentum to the fight for accountability. His office conducts independent investigations in response to citizen complaints about LMPD. These inquiries are timely, whereas LMPD’s internal reviews have routinely dragged on well past the police union’s own contract deadline of 180 days, sometimes taking years. 
Soon the Metro Council and mayor will decide whether to reappoint Ed Harness.
Harness is the right person for a second term as inspector general. He has navigated a difficult role with fairness and integrity, and in doing so he has amassed a great deal of valuable local institutional knowledge. He has worked consistently with diligence and professionalism to bring about community reform under three police chiefs and two mayors.
He has a track record of standing up for justice and reform even if it places him at odds with the chief of LMPD and the Fraternal Order of Police. When Harness took on this role, the Louisville Metro Police Department was far from welcoming. Initially, it took Harness months of pushing just to gain access to basic resources like body camera footage and internal documents. But by 2023, Harness described the year as “positive” for accountability, thanks to improved relations with police leaders and expanded access to records.
The Civilian Review & Accountability Board, which oversees the work of the inspector general’s office and works most closely with Harness, strongly supports his reappointment. They are joined by leading community organizations — including the People’s Consent Decree Coalition, Louisville NAACP, Louisville Urban League and Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression — in calling for his continued leadership.
Harness approaches his role with a deep respect for the work of oversight and a belief that lasting reform is only possible through collaboration. His work is grounded in building partnerships — with LMPD, the Civilian Review & Accountability Board and the broader community — to ensure that change is both practical and enduring. Harness’recent publication of  Detectives Best Practices Study is an example of how this collaborative approach can lead to research-driven recommendations that improve policing and strengthen public safety.
Yet the path to reform has been anything but smooth. After Breonna Taylor’s senseless death, the Department of Justice’s 2023 investigation exposed multiple patterns of unconstitutional policing that included excessive force, discriminatory enforcement and use of invalid warrants. Negotiations on a federal consent decree that would mandate specific reforms assessed by an independent monitor dragged on until December 2024 — only for the new Trump administration to dismiss it.
Mayor Craig Greenberg responded by introducing a local “Community Commitment” that included most but not all key elements of the federal consent decree. Most notably missing was robust community input.
Our community stands at a crossroads in its police reform efforts.
As the city pivots to the “Community Commitment” model, maintaining steady leadership continuity is essential.
Replacing Harness holds no guarantee of better results and could derail progress. It risks undermining the progress and momentum his office has built, as well as damaging community trust at a crucial time.
We call on Mayor Greenberg and Metro Council to renew Ed Harness’ appointment to ensure the city remains committed to transparency, justice and a police force that earns our confidence — one that makes us all feel safe. 
Losing Ed Harness risks a return to the broken system that led to tragedy.

(Photo by Capital News Service)Thomas King is used to cycling around Richmond. The Church Hill resident often rides on weekends and he also commutes by bike to his office a few miles away. He knows the best routes to take, what supplies to bring – such as spare tires – and now, he knows how to report almost-accidents on PlanRVA’s Near Miss Dashboard. 
On a recent Sunday after a ride near the University of Richmond, King almost collided with a driver. He was heading downhill on River Road going about 20 miles per hour. He was about to turn left back onto campus, when a driver also began to turn left out of the university.
“I had my arm out for like 200 yards, signaling that I was turning left into U of R Drive,” King said. “And as I was turning left, this guy starts turning into my body as I’m going.”
King said he either would have to go wide, which would make him go off the road and launch himself into the bushes.
“Or I hold the turn and pray that this guy doesn’t swipe my back wheel out and splatter me down the hillside,” he said. “I looked behind me as he did it and he missed my back wheel by less than six inches.”
However, that wasn’t King’s only near miss that day. In Westover Hills a driver made an illegal left turn to try to cut through a CVS parking lot.

“He just turned straight into me,” King said. “I had to launch my bike over to the side [to] not fall over. I was just like, ‘man, what is going on today? It’s like two near misses in one day.’”
Those two incidents led King to submit a report on PlanRVA’s Near Miss Dashboard. It’s the third time he’s logged his close calls in the new tool. 
PlanRVA’s goal is for the data they collect from their Near Miss map to be used to create safer streets for all users, according to Elizabeth Greenwell, a data analyst at PlanRVA who helped create the map. 
“A near miss is any event that does not result in an injury, but could have,” she said. “So for transportation planning, what we’re really looking at is those events that are unreported to the police. Something nearly happened or could have happened, but didn’t.”
Greenwell said the dashboard is a public engagement tool for safety in the region to crowdsource those “Near Miss” events, and particularly for bike and pedestrian transportation.
“A major thing that we want to come out of it is (to) take the data and provide our localities with information from the dashboard in a short report that would give them some hotspots of activity,” said Greenwell. “Maybe some analysis about what types of events are going on. Do they happen at crossings or what speeds are posted?”
PlanRVA’s map is still new in terms of the amount of data they’ve collected, said Greenwall, so they’re not quite ready to post any concrete findings just yet.
“Right now we have 184 responses, which feels like a lot considering it went live in March,” she said. “But I think we could get a lot more before we start getting into analysis with the data.”
Although it’s still relatively early in their data collection, they are already seeing some trends.
“These are extremely initial results, but a big thing is poor sightlines and poor visibility,” said Greenwell. “People don’t feel seen and that limits how safe they feel in a space. So that’s an interesting early takeaway.”
 How it works

PlanRVA’s digital map includes nine localities in the Central Virginia region, from Hanover County and the Town of Ashland to New Kent and Charles City and everything in between. Once you’re on the map, you can zoom into exact street locations and drop a pin — that’s when the survey window pops up. 
“It’s going to ask you, ‘how are you traveling? Were you walking, biking, wheelchair, on a scooter, micromobility device, e-bike?’” said Greenwell. “Was it a near miss, a collision or did you witness this?”
PlanRVA’s mapping tool is based on similar near miss dashboards, such as BikeMaps and the Northern Virginia Families For Safe Streets, which have been in existence much longer. BikeMaps started in 2014, while Families for Safe Streets in NOVA started in 2017. Both are able to parse out the data into chunks of statistics, such as  the highest number of near misses during certain hours of the day or which days are busiest for near misses. 
The Families for Safe Streets dashboard has had time to hone their data to make it useful for area officials, said Mike Doyle, founder and executive director of the Northern Virginia Families for Safe Streets. He started the non-profit after being released from the hospital after a car crashed into him while he was driving his car.
“In Alexandria we work well with the transportation people,” Doyle said. “They’ll ask us, what is your data saying on such and such a road, because they want to make a proposal. It helps support improvements that are all safety focused.”
Greenwell at PlanRVA said they are hoping to collect more data in the future. 
“We’re expanding our data storage so that we can start accumulating multiple years worth of data as it grows,” Greenwell said. “I’m working on the dashboard page to have a heat map, (and) better map pop-ups on the existing map so that users can see those comments about the events recorded as they interact with the map.”
Greenwell said they’d also like to be able to analyze both bike and pedestrian count data, which is something that BikeWalkRVA does every year, because it would give them a clearer picture of how risky some roads are and hopefully prevent people from using it until the infrastructure is improved. 
For now, residents like King can keep sharing their near misses as the dashboards get up to speed and help bolster public safety.
“You have these traumatic experiences and you’re the only one who’s experienced it and you want to do something a little bit more than just tell your friends this crazy thing happened,” King said. “You hope someone will do something about it.”

Most Virginia campaigns are won or lost on hot-button issues like taxes, education, reproductive rights, guns and gay marriage, so everyone who runs for office has a position on these questions. This holds true for candidates in this year’s high-stakes races for the state’s executive branch and all 100 House of Delegates seats. 
Inevitably, though, there are topics the average candidate doesn’t completely grasp. Some are narrow and – thankfully – nonpartisan. Where do you stand on Sunday hunting? Should I-81 have more lanes? How do you feel about skill games? Will you vote to save the menhaden, whatever a menhaden is? (It’s a fish, and I encourage you to say yes.)
Other topics affect the lives of every Virginian, but they are, frankly, complicated. One of these is energy. Not only is it hard to get up to speed on energy issues, but technology is changing so rapidly that keeping abreast of developments would be a full-time job. Who would spend that kind of time on such a dreary topic?
Uh, that would be me. 
So here we go: I’m going to cover five things political hopefuls need to know about energy in Virginia before you get to the General Assembly and start passing laws that affect your constituents’ wallets and futures. And for voters, these are things you should ask candidates about before they earn your vote. 
First up:
 If you are going to talk about energy, you have to talk about data centers

By now you surely know that Virginia has embraced the most energy-intensive industry to come along since the steam engine launched the Industrial Revolution. Northern Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, which already consume an estimated 25% of the state’s electricity, with massively more development planned. The reason isn’t vacation photos or Instagram cat videos; it’s the competition to develop artificial intelligence (AI).  
After putting tax incentives in place to attract the industry 15 years ago, the General Assembly and the current governor have rejected all attempts to put guardrails on development or make data centers more energy efficient. The subsidies now cost taxpayers a billion dollars per year (and counting). Virginia asks for almost nothing in return. 
Under the best of circumstances, the skyrocketing demand for electricity would put upward pressure on energy prices. But our situation is even worse: Virginia already imports about half our electricity from other states, and the regional grid that we’re part of faces its own energy crunch. 
Grid manager PJM has been so slow to approve new generation that governors from member states, including Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, wrote a letter taking PJM to task and urging it to move faster. But the damage has been done. Supply is tight, electricity prices have risen, and prices will continue to rise unless and until supply catches up.
PJM has decided to fast-track new high-cost, gas-fired generating plants ahead of the cheaper renewable energy projects that make up 95% of the queue. It’s a much-criticized move and seems more likely to increase costs. Once built, fossil gas plants burn a fuel that has doubled in price just over the past year, threatening a repeat of the post-pandemic price surge that Virginia ratepayers are still paying for. And there is no relief in sight, with utilities now having to compete with a doubling of U.S. natural gas exports.
Short of unleashing all the renewable energy stuck in the queue, there is no easy way to protect Virginia residents from higher electricity costs. Dominion Energy, Appalachian Power, and at least one of the electric cooperatives have proposed special rate classes for large-load customers, but that would shield residents from only some of the costs of serving the data centers. 
Utility bills are going up. Dominion Energy is seeking hefty rate increases that would push up residential bills by an average of more than $10 per month in base rates plus almost $11 per month in fuel costs, primarily due to those higher natural gas prices. Coal-heavy APCo has seen even steeper rate increases in the past few years.
Dominion proposes higher utility rates, new rate class for data centers

Virginia needs new legislation ensuring data centers bear the full expense and risks of serving Big Tech, and they should be required to source their own clean energy. Localities, meanwhile, must be required to evaluate the costs to all Virginians before they issue permits to data centers, including considerations like where the energy will come from, water impacts, and the siting of transmission lines.  
 You can’t get from here to there without solar

Virginia wasn’t producing all of its own energy even before the data center rush, and PJM’s problems are now pushing us into a crisis. Our near-term options are limited; new data centers are breaking ground at a breathtaking rate, and only solar can be installed on the timeline needed to prevent an energy shortfall. Even if we were willing to pay for high-priced gas or nuclear plants, developers face a backlog of as long as seven years for gas turbines, and advanced nuclear is still not commercially viable. 
Fortunately, solar is not just the fastest energy source to deploy, it’s also the cheapest and cleanest. Though President Donald Trump blames rising electricity prices on renewable energy, that’s false, just one of many myths the fossil fuel industry has propagated against solar. Nor is solar unreliable, another myth. When solar is paired with battery storage, it can match the rise and fall of demand perfectly.
The war on woke…energy?

It’s true, however, that while the great majority of Virginians support solar energy, many rural residents oppose it on aesthetic grounds. Of course, they would also oppose nuclear reactors and gas fracking in their neighborhoods. Legislators should  be sensitive to their concerns – but having chosen to welcome data centers, Virginia leaders can’t just shrug off the need for energy.
We also have to recognize that many farmers need to lease their land for solar in order to keep the land in their family and generate stable income. This should be as important a consideration to lawmakers as the objections of people who aren’t paying the taxes. Preventing landowners from making profitable use of their land is more likely to lead to the land being sold for development than to it remaining agricultural. 
The good news is that solar panels are compatible with agricultural uses including livestock grazing, beekeeping, vineyards and some crops. Dominion Energy uses sheep instead of lawnmowers at several of its solar facilities in Virginia and plans to expand the practice. The combination is a beautiful synergy: sheep and native grasses improve the soil, and in 30 years when the solar panels are removed, the land has not been lost to development.
While there is no getting around the need for utility-scale solar projects, rooftop solar also has an important role to play. In addition to harnessing private dollars to increase electricity generation, distributed solar saves money for customers and makes communities more resilient in the face of extreme weather.
This year the governor vetoed a bill to expand the role of distributed solar in Virginia. The legislation had garnered strong bipartisan support, so it will likely pass again next year. However, lawmakers will need to go further to encourage customer investments in solar now that federal tax credits will be eliminated for residential consumers at the end of this year.  
 Batteries: For all your reliability needs

The fastest-growing energy sector today is battery storage. Batteries allow utilities to meet peaks in demand without having to build gas combustion turbines that typically run less than 10% of the time. Batteries also pair perfectly with intermittent energy sources like wind and solar, storing their excess generation and then delivering electricity when these resources aren’t available.  
Battery prices have tumbled to new lows, while the technology continues to improve. Most lithium-ion batteries provide 4 hours of storage, enough to meet evening peak demand with midday solar. When renewable energy becomes a larger part of Virginia’s energy supply (it’s less than 10% now) we will need longer term storage, such as the iron-air batteries that are part of a Dominion pilot program. This year the governor vetoed a bill that would have increased the amount of storage our utilities must invest in. Given the increasing importance of batteries to the grid, the legislation will likely be reintroduced next year.
In Puerto Rico, customers are helping to keep the lights on. Could a Virginia program do the same?

Batteries installed at homes and businesses can also play a vital role in supporting the grid. Alone or combined with distributed solar, smart meters and electric vehicle charging, customer devices can be aggregated into a virtual power plant (VPP) to make more electricity available to the grid at peak demand times. Dominion will be developing a VPP pilot program under the terms of legislation passed this year. 
 Advanced nuclear is still in Maybeland

The enormous expense of building large nuclear plants using conventional light-water technology has made development almost nonexistent in this century. Proponents believe new technology will succeed with scaled-down plants that can, in theory, be standardized and modularized to lower costs. Many political and tech leaders hope these small modular reactors (SMRs) will prove a carbon-free solution to the data center energy problem. 
It’s hard not to think they’re kidding themselves, or maybe us. Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power plan to develop one SMR each, with Dominion shooting to have one in service in 2035. Not only is this too late to meet today’s energy crunch, but a single SMR would add less energy to the supply side than new data centers add to the demand side each year. Virginia still needs near-term solutions, which means solar and batteries. 
Industry enthusiasts believe the 2035 timeline can be shortened, while critics say SMRs may never reach commercial viability. SMRs have to be able to compete on cost with much cheaper renewable energy, including wind, solar and emerging geothermal technologies, and cost parity is a long way off. The economic case for nuclear reactors also requires that they generate power all the time, including when the demand isn’t there, so SMRs need batteries almost as much as renewable energy does.
Geothermal energy is having a moment. Could it power Virginia’s data centers?

Finally, radioactive waste remains a challenging issue, as much (or more) for SMRs as for legacy nuclear plants. The U.S. has never resolved the problem of permanent storage, so nuclear waste is simply kept onsite at generating stations. The risk of accidents or sabotage makes it unlikely that communities will accept SMRs in their midst, especially if the idea is for SMRs to proliferate on the premises of privately-owned data centers near residential areas statewide.  
A nuclear technology with less of a waste problem?  Fusion energy. A fusion start-up plans to build its first power plant in Virginia in the “early 2030s,” if the demonstration plant it is building in Massachusetts proves successful. While fusion would be an energy game-changer, there are so many uncertainties around timeline and cost that only an inveterate gambler would bet on it helping us out of our predicament. 
 Pretending climate change isn’t real won’t make it go away

We don’t have to talk about climate change to make the case for transitioning to carbon-free renewable energy, but global warming hovers in the background of any energy debate like an unwanted guest. If you need a primer or are even slightly tempted to say you “don’t know” whether human activity is responsible because you’re not a scientist, read the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s summary for policymakers. The continued habitability of the planet is too important for ignorance to be an acceptable dodge – and of course you, as a respectable candidate, would never stoop to such a thing.
Virginia codified its own action plan in 2020 with two major laws. One provides for the commonwealth to participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a multistate compact that uses auctions of carbon emission allowances to incentivize a shift away from fossil fuels and raise money for energy efficiency and climate adaptation. After taking office in 2022,  Youngkin removed Virginia from RGGI – illegally, as a court ruled. Virginia remains outside RGGI while the appeals process continues. 
The second law is the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), which creates a pathway for Dominion and APCo to transition to carbon-free electricity by 2050. The VCEA includes provisions requiring Dominion and APCo to invest in renewable energy, storage and energy efficiency and make renewable energy an increasing portion of their electricity supply. 
The VCEA contains special provisions for offshore wind, which I haven’t addressed here because  Trump is determined not to allow projects to move forward while he is in office. This is a shame, as there is bipartisan support in Virginia for this industry and the huge economic development opportunities that come with it. Still, Virginia’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project is 60% complete and will start delivering power next year. Eventually, hopefully, it will be remembered as the first of many.
The VCEA also prohibited new investments in fossil fuel plants except under certain conditions. Dominion is currently seeking permission from the State Corporation Commission to build a $1.5 billion, fossil gas-fired peaker plant, citing data center demand and a need for reliability. Local residents, environmental organizations and ratepayer advocates oppose the plant and filed expert testimony showing that solar, storage and other less expensive technologies would better serve consumers.
In what passes for a bombshell in the energy space, Dominion was forced to admit last month that it had not obtained an independent review of the bid process before selecting its own gas plant over resources offered by third-party bidders.
 “No regrets” solutions are progressive and conservative

As you’ve probably figured out by now, there is no perfect power source available today. And yet we would need new generation even if we stopped data center construction cold in its tracks – which isn’t in the plans. Solar is the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest source of generation, allowing us to preserve land – and keep options open – for the future. If the data center boom goes bust, having surplus clean energy on the grid will let us eliminate dirty sources faster, while saving money. 
Who would run against that?

(Photo by Allegra Boverman/New Hampshire Bulletin)Maria Khan spent much of this year terrified as she watched Congress debate whether to cut funding for federal food assistance and other programs she relies on.
“It severely affected my mental health,” she said. “I was getting really bad. I had to get off social media. I’ve had to stop looking into it because I couldn’t function. I was just living in fear, and I was finding that I was really having a hard time parenting and functioning for myself.”
In July, her fears were realized when President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act became law. The behemoth legislation touches nearly every segment of the federal government and makes severe cuts to Medicaid and other social programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP or food stamps, that Khan uses to feed her family.
The SNAP changes, many of which go into effect as soon as states can implement them while others will be implemented as late as 2028, are expected to cause roughly 44,000 families in New Hampshire — and 22.3 million nationwide — to lose some or all of their benefits, according to analysis from the Urban Institute. However, many economists and hunger experts say the consequences will be much more far-reaching, straining food banks and other social services, hitting the bottom line of farmers and grocery stores and municipalities.
The new law restricts what factors will be taken into account when deciding how much help a family receives. And it caps future increases to SNAP at the rate of inflation. It also makes work requirements stricter and bans many legal migrants from the program.
Will the state pick up the slack?
Laura Milliken is executive director at NH Hunger Solutions, an advocacy group working to address hunger in the state. She vehemently opposes the law.
“Increasing the burden on the lowest income folks to benefit the highest income folks seems like an incredibly unjust thing to do,” Milliken said. “And I am very worried about people in New Hampshire who are already struggling to make ends meet.”
The new law passes off much of the program’s administrative cost to state governments, and Milliken said she hopes New Hampshire can come up with the additional nearly $6 million it will need. She acknowledges that “would be incredibly hard.” The state already pays $11 million to administer the program. And starting in 2027, the state will have to cover some of the food costs which are currently federally funded.

Asked whether she would support the state appropriating money to do so, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte told the Bulletin she’s evaluating it.
“We’re evaluating how can we make sure we can serve as many people as possible and people who are being served now with the resources we have,” she said. “And also, I’m going to continue to fight for as many federal resources as I can when it comes to SNAP and other programs.”
Ayotte said she disagreed with the SNAP reductions, adding “I think SNAP is a really important program.”
But it’s unclear if the state can afford to absorb the costs. It’s coming off a difficult budget cycle characterized by heavy infighting. Lawmakers crafting a state spending plan this year made significant cuts to agencies across state government to deal with months of lagging business tax revenues, the end of pandemic-era federal funds, and millions of dollars in settlements for victims of abuse in the state’s juvenile detention system. 
Drew Cline, executive director at the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a New Hampshire conservative think tank, said the state should’ve seen this coming.
Cline argued New Hampshire “has relied for far too long on these pretty high federal expenditures on these programs, and it was becoming increasingly clear as the deficits started to really grow in recent years that the federal government simply wasn’t going to be able to maintain its commitment to these programs.”
Cline argued it’s also important to consider the increases in SNAP spending over the past few decades. Adjusted for inflation, SNAP spending rose from roughly $31.3 billion in 2000 to $97.9 billion in 2010 and $100.3 billion in 2024, according to Food and Nutrition Service data compiled by USAFacts. He argued this was unsustainable.
“There’s just no way we should be borrowing and spending as much as we do without some sort of catastrophic economic crisis,” he said.
The spending cuts in the law were designed to make space in the budget to extend a series of tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term. The tax cuts have been lambasted by those who point out that they disproportionately benefit the wealthy and are expected to add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Cline said the tax cuts will bring economic growth to the state. As for the top 1% of New Hampshire households receiving 16% of the tax savings, according to analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, he said it isn’t an issue because “the rich are the ones who pay the vast majority of income taxes.”
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which tracks U.S. grocery prices, a “low-cost plan” for feeding one 9- to 11-year-old child a healthy diet is $261.50 a month. Here, the produce section of Hannaford in Nashua. (Photo by Allegra Boverman/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Hunger in New Hampshire
Khan, 39, lives in Portsmouth with her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son. She lost her job as a software engineer for Liberty Mutual during a mass layoff last year. Since then, she has been doing gig work with Door Dash, but still struggles to find the money to feed her family amid skyrocketing grocery costs. She’s hoping to go back to school in an effort to get a job that pays more.
She enrolled in SNAP last winter. Until recently, she received $440 in food benefits, but a few months ago her benefits increased to $550. She also receives help from Gather, a food pantry in Portsmouth, and her ex-husband contributes child support, she said.
“Even that is not enough,” Khan said. “Cereal is like six or seven bucks now. It’s not enough. So to cut that is going to be — I don’t even know what we’re going to do.”
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which tracks U.S. grocery prices, a “low-cost plan” for feeding one 9- to 11-year-old child a healthy diet is $261.50 a month and for an adult woman (19-50 years old) it’s $259 a month. A “liberal plan” would cost $390 for a 9- to 11-year-old and $383.40 for an adult woman. Khan is feeding two children and herself.
Food pantries worry they’ll struggle to keep up with increased demand as benefits are reduced.

Cynthia Tokos, director of parish life at Christ the King Parish in Concord, said in an email to the Bulletin that the food pantry the parish operates doesn’t ask those they help for information about what benefits they receive. However, volunteers tell her they hear “generic comments about ‘my benefits were cut’ or ‘income guidelines were changed, so I’m getting less help with food.’”
The cuts from the massive tax and spending cut law haven’t taken effect yet, but enrollees and food pantries have felt cuts previously. In March 2023, increased SNAP benefits instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic expired, resulting in New Hampshire SNAP recipients losing a total of nearly $7 million in benefits per month, according to the Food Research and Action Center.
“Sometimes we see new clients because they are now struggling to make ends meet due to cuts in aid, where they had previously been getting by,” Tokos said. “It might not be 100% related to SNAP — we’re not always sure what aid people are receiving; however, it’s a linear relationship — when food benefits are cut, more help/support from food pantries and other food sources is needed.”
She said volunteers also hear people talking about food they’re no longer buying because of higher costs and “constant conversations about the increase in price of most food items at the grocery store, and through these conversations it is clear that our clients are working hard to stretch every food dollar.”

Ripple effects through the economy
Many economists view SNAP as a strong economic driver. They point out it’s a direct infusion into local economies as enrollees spend their benefits at local grocery stores that in turn hire local employees. And it also frees up other resources needed to pay for housing, medicine, or clothing. In a 2021 study evaluating “bangs-for-the-buck,” Moody’s Analytics determined SNAP is one of the most effective programs at growing the economy, particularly because it grows when the economy recedes. 
“SNAP is particularly effective economic stimulus because it provides resources to households that do not have very much to begin with, and those individuals and families spend them quickly and directly in their local economies,” Phil Sletten, an economist and research director at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, wrote in an email to the Bulletin. 
“Dollars spent on SNAP support jobs at community grocery stores and provide supports to families that may otherwise go without food, hurting their abilities to be healthy and participate in the economy in other ways, such as working,” he continued. “Less federal money flowing to New Hampshire through SNAP, and the Granite Staters that benefit from it, could reduce economic activity in the state, including in rural areas.”
Research from the Center for American Progress found that the SNAP cuts are likely to harm more than 27,000 retailers across the U.S. In New Hampshire, there are 1,053 SNAP retailers, according to that research.
Those grocery stores source many of their goods from American farms. The bill that created the modern SNAP program, by reauthorizing and renaming the food stamps program in existence since the 1930s, was the 2008 Farm Bill. Lawmakers envisioned it as a boost to agricultural sales.

Beth Hodge, who co-owns Echo Farm with her sister, said she’s concerned low-income customers will be forced to cut back on dairy products at the grocery store, reducing demand across the industry.
“Then there’s the other piece of knowing that people in your own community, in your own state, are going to be impacted by that,” Hodge said. “We want to feed people. You don’t go into this business if you don’t want to feed people.”
Echo Farms has around 120 cows on 35 acres. It provides roughly 80% of the milk it produces to a Cabot Cheese plant in neighboring Vermont. The remainder is used in a pudding made in-house.
The USDA doesn’t track how SNAP benefits are used, making data hard to compile. However, Hoard’s Dairyman, a national dairy trade publication, reports that 35% of dairy products are sold at retail, and SNAP benefits account for 8.6% of that retail spending.
Hodge noted that dairy is a product distributed more locally than others. Because of this, dairy farms are “really tied to the economy.” She called dairy “the linchpin to the agriculture in the state.”
“In the Northeast and New England, New Hampshire in particular, the one local food that’s really consistent yearround, that’s consistent in most households, in schools, is dairy,” she said. “We’re not going to grow oranges in New Hampshire. It’s just not possible. We’re always going to be bringing that in from another part of the country. Dairy is something that we can produce really well. … It’s something that typically stays local. So if you’re consuming dairy products, if you’re buying milk from Hood, it’s not coming from California. It’s going to come from dairies that are close by the plant.”
Hodge acknowledged the bill, which is nearly 900 pages, does include provisions that help dairy farmers, including one that increases the amount of milk that can be covered by farm insurance at special reduced rates. She also noted that other unrelated factors make it a good time to be a dairy farmer in the Northeast, like new Chobani yogurt and Fairlife milk plants breaking ground in Upstate New York that are expected to increase demand across the region.
“Then you start hearing those other new things, and it starts to dampen that sort of enthusiasm,” she said.
To Hodge, farming is sentimental and something intrinsically tied to the community. She and her sister got into farming after raising cattle in 4-H when they were young. They’re proud to say that over 90 local teenagers worked their first job at Echo Farm. They see feeding communities as the core of what they do.
“The thought that somebody is food insecure or somebody has trouble getting a meal is something that farmers feel deeply,” Hodge said.
Hits to property taxes
Somersworth Mayor Matt Gerding said his first thought after hearing about the cuts was, ‘What are some of the folks that live here in Somersworth going to do?’”
“It feels like what Congress and the president were doing was targeting communities like us,” he said. “And it’s scary.”
Matt Gerding
Gerding said he’s heard from lots of concerned residents and he’s spoken with the Somersworth Housing Authority about how this will hurt low-income people’s ability to pay rent, as well leaders in the school system about how they want to push to get people enrolled in free-and-reduced lunch. (Being on SNAP automatically enrolls students for free-and-reduced school lunches.) 
He’s also concerned about the city’s Welfare and Human Services Office being further burdened, and about a hit to the city’s property tax revenues.
“I think what I’m most nervous about is that, because these tax bills come only twice a year, these families are going to have to be making decisions about where they’re spending their money,” Gerding said. “And I think, and I certainly can’t blame them, that the annual tax bill might be at the bottom of the list of the things that they want to pay for.
“Taxes are the least of their worries when they have mouths to feed,” he said.
Other programs cut
The law also requires that enrollees work 80 hours a month or lose Medicaid coverage despite research that suggests work requirements for SNAP, Medicaid, and other social programs don’t increase employment, but often strip benefits from eligible people due to the burdensome bureaucracy needed to administer work requirements. In SNAP specifically, the requirements resulted in a 23-percentage-point increase in disenrollment and kicked 64% of people subject to the requirements who are actually eligible off the program.
Khan, who also relies on Medicaid for her Type 2 diabetes medication and doctors’ visits, said she can’t afford the skyrocketing price of child care in New Hampshire, which makes it hard for her to work during summer or outside of school hours. On top of that, her rent is set to increase to $2,300 in September.
Asked about her worst fears, Khan said “lack of food, lack of housing, lack of medical care.”
“Am I going to be healthy enough to take care of my children, being a single mom with no family,” she continued. “What is that going to look like for my family? It is a very scary situation, and my kids rely on myself to have food on the table.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/snap2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 05:59:39.720032

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The State Library of Ohio is one of many libraries across the country awaiting legal battles over federal funding and congressional debates as to how much they’ll receive next year.
The library receives state funding, but in the past has received support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which serves as the federal bucket of funding for libraries and museums across the country.
Lawsuits
Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order seeking to eliminate funding to the institute as part of slashing of funds in partnership with the Department of Government Efficiency, a non-governmental agency then run by Elon Musk. He attempted to eliminate the institute, among other arts and humanities cuts, in his previous administration as well.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe American Library Association is part of a lawsuit attempting stop that executive order. The association said in their initial complaint that following the March order, the institute was “gutted” by DOGE. Staff were placed on administrative leave, and grants were canceled, all without congressional approval.
“Without grant funding or IMLS staff to process reimbursements, local and state libraries will suffer an immediate and irreparable inability to pay vendors or staff hired in reliance on IMLS’ promise to make these reimbursements,” attorneys for the ALA stated.
In May, the district court judge in the case granted a temporary pause in enforcement of the order “to preserve the status quo” as the case continued. However, in June, the judge denied a motion for a further pause to the executive order.
“While the court laments the executive branch’s efforts to cut off this lifeline for libraries and museums, plaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,” Judge Richard J. Leon wrote.
Most recently, the ALA filed a motion to end the case via summary judgment, which is an order by the judge that the case is cut-and-dry enough to rule without a trial or further proceedings.
The ALA, along with the advocacy group Democracy Forward, asked that a judge in a D.C. district court rule in their favor under violations of the constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine, among others. The groups called the actions of the Trump administration “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion” and “unconstitutional.”
Another lawsuit targeting the the executive order was filed by attorneys general in 21 states, not including Ohio. On Thursday, an appeals court upheld the previous court’s decision in that case, meaning the Trump administration still can’t enforce the executive order as the case goes on.
The beat goes on
As legal challengers await final decisions, libraries still have to open their doors and provide needed services.
“Local (library) budgets are tight enough, and not honoring those federal tax dollars will put communities in a crunch,” said Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association.
Helmick said the loss of those previously mandated funds could mean reductions in services, and “could unintentionally cost state and local taxpayers more” because contracts have already been signed with consortiums and other resource organizations that are owed money, whether its federal monies as promised, or not.

The State Library of Ohio is not a member of the ALA, but it does receive funds from the institute. The state agency uses the funds to bolster digital resources across the state and other resource-sharing programs with local libraries. State funds go toward conservation efforts within the state library, to keep Ohio’s founding documents and other historical artifacts properly stored.
The library’s funding mechanism on the state side changed slightly with the passage of the most recent state operating budget. Funds going to the State Library of Ohio were put into an operating expenses fund under the Public Library Fund umbrella. The expenses fund provides $9 million over the next two years to the state library, which State Librarian Mandy Knapp said was a cut of $245,000 in fiscal year 2026 and another $331,000 in 2027, compared to the House’s version of the budget.
“Unfortunately, our budget has faced significant reductions, resulting in the elimination of a substantial number of staff positions over time,” a spokesperson for the State Library of Ohio told the Capital Journal. “Flat funding for the State Library this year has contributed to a loss of 26% of our state funding over the last 20 years, leading to a 50% decrease in staff positions over that same time.”
On top of uncertainty as to how the lawsuits will resolve and less-than-desired state funding, the state library is awaiting final word on federal funding for the Institute for Museum and Library Services in fiscal year 2026, which is still being ironed out in both chambers of Congress.
‘Access and opportunity’
In 2025, the State Library of Ohio received $5.4 million from the IMLS’ Grants to States program, according to institute data.
The institute uses a population-based formula to distribute the funds to state library administrative agencies. Agencies use the funding directly or through “competitive sub awards” to libraries of all kinds.
Some of the federal funds the state library received through the federal program went toward monthly deaf storytimes, a digital microfilm scanner for newspapers and historical records, along with e-readers and e-books for home-bound Ohioans.
Other awards went to the Toledo Lucas County Public Library to support a Science of Reading project and more than $340,000 spread between 18 rural public libraries for technology training like computer instruction and one-on-on tutoring.
Without the funds, library users across the country could see limited access and longer lines for digital resources and even the loss of programs like summer reading and employment help.
“When federal funds are cut, communities lose access and opportunity,” ALA President Helmick said. “A reader delayed is a reader denied.”
Libraries have made strides to broaden their reach and tailor their services to their local communities, and have had to do so with thinner and thinner pocketbooks. For Helmick, the scrutiny over library funding is a distraction from other existing problems, when public support for libraries has remained strong.
“Teaching our children how to think instead of what to think has always been the American way,” Helmick said.
Federal funding for next year has survived a congressional hurdle, having passed out of committees in both the U.S. House and Senate.
The funding proposals are similar, with the U.S. House version recommending an IMLS budget of $291.8 million in 2026. This proposal is a $3 million cut from the funding the institute received in 2025, but it’s an about-face from President Donald Trump’s discretionary budget, which proposed only $6 million for the fiscal year.
The House Appropriations Committee specifically mentioned the IMLS’ “commitment” to working on the 250th anniversary celebrations for the signing of the Declaration of Independence happening next year in a Sept. 9 report.
“IMLS has a key role in supporting existing activities and new projects at the state and local levels that enhance civic engagement, innovation and community collaboration in preparation for the 250th Anniversary,” the committee stated in the report.

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderLiving in a rural area, almost by definition, means being a little bit further away from the big box stores and modern conveniences, like rideshares and food deliveries. Rural living should not, however, mean that you cannot access health care. Right now, too many Georgians living in small towns and rural areas struggle to access care, often going longer between doctor’s visits and waiting months to see practitioners a county or two over. Unfortunately, this problem will only get worse if Congress fails to renew the enhanced premium tax credits that 1.4 million Georgians rely on to afford their health insurance.
These tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year, meaning premiums will undoubtedly skyrocket for this nearly 13% of Peach State residents. With families’ budgets already stretched thin, these increases will lead to more uninsured Georgians. For those living in rural areas, which we know have higher rates of uninsured residents than their urban counterparts to begin with, the downstream effects of this considerable coverage loss will be especially devastating.
Tragically, patients who do not have coverage are more likely to delay care, and may land in the emergency room when their condition worsens. Without access to affordable coverage, those trips to the emergency room add to the uncompensated care that’s placing additional strain on already fraying rural health systems.
Unfortunately, many of Georgia’s rural hospitals are already operating on razor thin margins. In fact, nine rural Georgia hospitals have closed since 2010, and as many as 18 more are now struggling and in danger of closing or dramatically reducing services. And recent federal cuts to the Medicaid program are further threatening rural hospitals’ stability. The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill identified four rural Georgia hospitals at high risk of closing or reducing critical services — exacerbated by the recently-passed reconciliation bill in Congress. As it is, our state is behind only Tennessee and Texas in the number of hospital closures. When a hospital closes in a small community, the ripple effects are felt for both miles and decades to come.
When a rural hospital closes, doctors, nurses, orderlies, and countless other hardworking medical professionals lose their jobs and may be forced to move away in search of other employment. Suddenly, emergency care and other health services are much further away or even out of reach from residents. Local pharmacies, diners, and other businesses fueled by hospital traffic and jobs become desolate and eventually shutter their doors as well. And as more and more hospitals close, rural residents are forced to travel counties away to get the care they need. In emergency situations, this can be the difference between life and death. And in non-emergency situations, the cost of delaying or foregoing preventive care is enormous — both for the health of our rural communities and our economy. When people are unable to access timely care, they can fall sick, and become unable to actively participate in the workforce and provide for their families.
Thankfully, Congress has the ability to avoid this huge increase in uncompensated care and the disastrous effects it would have on rural hospitals, economies, and communities: they must extend the enhanced premium tax credits before they expire at the end of the year. Our federal representatives on both sides of the aisle have the opportunity to extend the tax credits through legislation moving in the coming months — and protecting access to affordable health care for rural Georgians should be a bipartisan issue.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature has debated how aggressive the state should be in protecting consumer privacy online for the past several years. But competing proposals — along with sizable behind-the-scenes influence from lobbyists — have left the state still without a comprehensive data privacy law. 
When lawmakers return in January, the issue will again be in play. However, this time, they will have insight into how the more stringent version of such law actually works in practice.
Deviating from the more than a dozen states that have adopted a model favored by industry groups, Maryland passed a version that places stricter standards on what data companies can collect or sell, similar to the proposal in Maine that has been favored by the majority of the Judiciary Committee. That law will take effect on Oct. 1. 
In an interview with Maine Morning Star, Maryland Sen. Sara Love, one of the lead sponsors of the soon-to-be law, said it took several years and intentional countering of a sizable lobbying effort to get it passed. Quoting Maine Morning Star’s 2024 article on lobbying in Maine and across the country, Love said it was like “death by a thousand cuts” with trade organization lobbyists backed by Big Tech asking for more and more amendments. 
“A legislator wants to work with groups and compromise with them, but all of a sudden you realize, if you do that, you have nothing — you have a bill that is not worth the paper it’s written on,” Love said. “So we decided ahead of time, what are the most important things to us? Where can we compromise, and where are we drawing the line?”
Lawmakers still split over data privacy policy as bill advances to floor

What ultimately got the bill over the finish line, Love said, was supportive committee chairs and “I think for us, the tech community overplayed their hand.” Another effort to undermine the Maryland law was attempted this year with a bill that Google explicitly supported, though it failed. 
In Maine, there is still steep opposition from some lawmakers and local businesses to the proposal most similar to Maryland’s law. Some of the resistance is similar to that seen in Maryland, including concerns about untested language, but an uncertain economic landscape is now also part of the picture, including impact from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
The proposals in Maine 
Lawmakers started 2025 with three separate proposals. 
The one favored by the Judiciary Committee was carried over into next year and, despite not actually making it to a vote in the Maine Senate or House of Representatives, it drew the most lobbying spending. This bill, LD 1822 sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), would make Maine have some of the strictest consumer protections in the country. 
The committee nixed a competing plan that was the favorite of business interests, LD 1224 sponsored by Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick), unanimously voting it down in an attempt to limit the number of proposals considered by the full Legislature. 
A similar plan, LD 1088 sponsored by Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), did make it to the floor but died upon adjournment after the House rejected it. But Henderson plans to propose her version again as an amendment to LD 1822 next year. 
Disagreement over what the fundamental framework of such a law should be remains. 










We decided ahead of time, what are the most important things to us? Where can we compromise, and where are we drawing the line?

Kuhn’s bill relies on a data minimization standard, which broadly means limiting the collection of personal information to only what is necessary to fulfill the consumer service. This is the standard Maryland’s law uses. 
The version businesses favor uses what’s referred to as an opt-in model, allowing companies to collect data as long as consumers agree to it.
“The whole point of a data privacy law is to reduce the amount of data overall that is collected about us, and this, in fact, would do that,” Kuhn said of her proposal.  
Whereas Henderson said, “I know for sure that it does not go too far,” referring to her proposal’s regulations on businesses, “and that isn’t something I can say for LD 1822.” 
Roberts did not respond to Maine Morning Star’s request for comment. 
How will the proposals impact small businesses? 
In both 2024 and 2025, a key point of pushback from businesses to the stricter proposal was that it would limit their ability to do targeted advertising, a tactic opponents say is disproportionately relied on by small businesses with limited marketing dollars. 
Kuhn built her bill off of one considered in the 131st Legislature and said she met with small businesses to try to address remaining concerns before the 132nd Legislature began. 
She preserved exemptions that had already been negotiated, including for entire companies whose data collection is already regulated by federal laws. She also made a handful of tweaks based on feedback from businesses. 
Notably, she eliminated data identifying an individual’s “online activities over time and across 3rd party websites or online services” from the definition of sensitive data, which would have reduced the ability to track cookies.
“It is critically important that Maine small businesses have access to these digital marketing tools,” Kuhn said. “That question is not in dispute.” 
However, business interests are not satisfied.

Targeted advertising
Kuhn’s proposal wouldn’t restrict a business’ ability to do targeted advertising to existing customers, Curtis Picard, CEO of the Retail Association of Maine, which testified against LD 1822, told Maine Morning Star. 
But Picard said it would place limits on how they can target new customers — a claim that Kuhn argues is false.
Picard gave the example of someone coming across an ad on social media that they engage with and then after the company pushes an ad or an email giving that person a discount on their first purchase. 
“This is an example of a commonly stated generic concern — ‘businesses won’t be able to reach future customers’ — that has been frequently made without any substantiation,” Kuhn said.
Kuhn pointed out that, in that scenario, if a consumer is presented with an ad on social media and then clicks on the link, the consumer has requested a product or service — in this case, access to the website — and received it. Therefore, she said, cookies can be attached and subsequent ads are permitted.
Kuhn’s proposal sets two thresholds for data collection. 
It would restrict the collection of personal data (information that can be reasonably linked to a consumer) to only what’s “reasonably necessary and proportionate” to provide the service requested by a consumer. It would also restrict the collection of sensitive data (such as race, citizenship, genetic and other information as defined in the bill) to only what’s “strictly necessary” in that scenario, and outright ban such information from being sold.
“A lot of well meaning small businesses are saying it’s going to hurt them but they can’t articulate how,” Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), a co-sponsor of Kuhn’s bill who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, told Maine Morning Star. “The only answer we’re getting back is uncertainty, which is, in Augusta speak, we don’t actually have any policy concerns with the bill anymore.”
At a work session on May 23, Kuhn asked Stacy Stitham, managing partner at Brann & Isaacson who was working on behalf of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, “Where in the bill is there a barrier to reaching a new customer?” 
Stitham responded, “You have to go back to basically the first sentence of the statute which limits the collection of data to what’s reasonably necessary and proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the consumer,” which is the data minimization standard. 
This mirrors the Maryland law. Stitham added, “As we know, the Maryland law is not in effect yet. We don’t know how that’s being interpreted, but it’s much different than the standard that’s used by other states which talk about disclosed purposes.”
During the final work session for the bill this year on May 30, ​​Maine Assistant Attorney General Brendan O’Neil from the consumer protection office said, “I don’t see a restriction on targeted advertising in the bill.”
There is currently a patchwork of state laws and parts of federal legislation governing internet privacy, as there remains no one overarching federal law, despite several proposals. Connecticut was the fifth state to enact an omnibus privacy law in 2022 but its version, the one favored by industry groups, has been the model adopted by most states that followed. 
In the work session, O’Neil pointed to the Connecticut’s attorney general’s recommendation for its state Legislature to amend the law to strengthen data minimization provisions rather than rely on its current “exploitable” consent model.
Reading from the officer’s report, O’Neil summarized, “‘serious privacy and data security concerns could have been offset, if not fully alleviated, if companies had properly minimized the data they collected and maintained.’ That’s really what LD 1822’s data minimization standard aims to do.” 
Connecticut tweaked its law in several ways this spring, but did not ultimately adopt the data minimization standard as seen in Kuhn’s proposal and the Maryland law. 
Consumer consent
On May 29, a coalition of business groups including the Maine State Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee outlining their major concerns, notably the data minimization standard. 
But the letter also took issue with the sensitive data restrictions — which mirror those in Maryland’s law — arguing instead that data use should be tied to consumer consent, not based on data type. 
This was another common argument brought up by those who favored Henderson’s version. 
“They want to completely remove consent so that a consumer can’t even consent to have their information used to get discounts or to be marketed to and I want to keep that consent piece,” Henderson said.
Stitham, representing the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, made a similar point this spring. 
“While clearly intended to be more consumer protective,” Stitham said, “by shifting the focus from consumer consent to disclosed purposes to whatever the business can characterize as needed to provide or maintain a requested product or service, the bill actually eliminates consumer choice and control, and potentially leaves room for businesses to justify broad data collection practices without the consumer’s clear, informed consent.”
Kuhn and lawmakers who favor her proposal said this argument rests on a false contention that Maine consumers engage in informed and voluntary consent now.

Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) said Henderson’s bill “was essentially preserving the status quo with regard to the protections that consumers currently have in the absence of any data privacy law.”
It would take the average person more than 40 hours per month to read the privacy policies that an American consumer typically encounters each month, according to testimony given to the committee and affirmed by recent studies.  
Kuhn gave the example of health tracker apps that require consumer consent to the terms and conditions in order to use the product when saying, “That’s not voluntary consent. It’s a mandatory threshold.”
Henderson drew a distinction between lengthy terms and conditions and what would be required in her bill. “It has to be clear, conspicuous, bold,” she said of the privacy notice allowing consumers to opt out of having their data sold or used in marketing.

Uncertainty 
When asked to comment on their latest stance on Kuhn’s bill, L.L. Bean deferred to the company’s testimony, in which legal counsel Christy van Voorhees argued LD 1822’s data minimization standard effectively bans the vast majority of personalized, targeted advertising.
This testimony echoed that of many businesses, but also underscored that the current political landscape is another key factor. 
“These restrictions are being proposed at a historically challenging time for Maine retailers,” van Voorhees said. “The ongoing retreat of Canadian customers from U.S. businesses, coupled with the increased costs associated with new universal and threatened reciprocal tariffs, is squeezing marketing budgets. That means that the marketing investments we do make have to be efficient. Personalized, targeted ads are among our most efficient marketing investments.” 
Concern of economic uncertainty — which was also raised by industry associations such as HospitalityMaine and individual businesses like Union River Lobster Pot restaurant — makes Kuhn believe the decision to carry over her bill to the next session was the best choice, as well as opportune timing with the start of Maryland’s law. 
With an effective date of Oct. 1, Maryland’s law will provide three months of results by the time the Maine Legislature returns in January, though there is also a cure period, giving entities 60 days to adhere after a notice of violation from the Maryland Attorney General on or before April 1, 2027. 
“We’ll be able to see, what impact did this phrasing, this language, have on small businesses in Maryland?” Kuhn said. “Were they able to continue to draw ads just as they can now?” 
As Maine has considered a data privacy law, businesses have stressed the importance of interoperability between states. 
“I’m getting tired of Maine being this petri dish for national groups trying to get first-in-the-nation type of legislation,” said Picard, of the retail association. “I do think Representative Kuhn was trying to make it work, but ultimately it ends up being convoluted and complex language that has been untested.”
Now, Kuhn and supporters of her proposal say Maryland’s law will provide that test, affording a preview of how passing such a law would go in Maine.
But others say it’ll be too soon to tell. 
“You’re not going to see the sky fall in a few months,” Henderson said.
Kuhn and Henderson said if either version of a data privacy law is finally passed next session, continuous adjustments will still be needed. Both of their bills would require annual reviews by the state attorney general, similar to those required in other states. 
Currently, LD 1822, Kuhn’s bill that was carried over, is still in possession of the Maine House. It’s unclear whether the body will recommit it to committee or take action on the floor when lawmakers return. 
Other than shifting the implementation date back, Kuhn doesn’t plan to amend her proposal, but she said she’s leaving the possibility open if any glaring need for changes become apparent once Maryland’s law is in effect. 
There is also a concept draft, LD 595 sponsored by Carney, being carried over into next year. It currently reads that it could “further update certain consumer privacy laws in response to recent developments in federal and state consumer privacy laws.”
Carney said she originally filed the placeholder bill not knowing what the changes would be made to Connecticut’s law or possible federal law. The legislation will now serve a similar purpose next year as a way for the Judiciary Committee to address the moment — whatever it may look like — if needed.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)President Donald Trump won’t play a role in the Ohio redistricting process, according to Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, who said that he won’t be pressured into giving the administration their desired maps.
Even though Ohio leaders just announced the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting on Wednesday, the process is already rocky.
“We’re off to a bad start when the other side calls a press conference and says ‘It has to be this or nothing else,'” Huffman (R-Lima) said.
The speaker and Ohio Republicans are disappointed in the Democrats, arguing that they are not playing fair because redistricting should be a bipartisan process.
The joint committee is supposed to start the process, drawing a map publicly. Each of the House and Senate leaders gets to appoint representatives, with four Republicans and two Democrats per chamber.
State Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, will be the co-chair and will be joined by Reps. Nick Santucci, R-Niles, Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, D.J. Swearingen, R-Huron, Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, and House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati.
Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, chose state Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Township, as co-chair, and she will be joined by Sens. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, Bill Reineke, R-Tiffin, Willis E. Blackshear Jr., D-Dayton, and Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood.
“They didn’t want the map drawn ‘behind closed doors’ is the metaphor — which was apparently what happened with the map yesterday,” Huffman said.
On Tuesday, Democrats introduced their version of a map.
Ohio Democrats introduce congressional redistricting proposal

Currently, there are 10 Republicans and 5 Democrats representing Ohio in the U.S. House. President Donald Trump won Ohio 55-44% in 2024. With that result, Ohio’s 15 congressional districts would proportionately be eight Republican and seven Democratic. This proportionality was reflected in the Dems’ map.
“The fairest redistricting proposal that either party has put forward,” Antonio said Tuesday.
House Assistant Minority Leader Phil Robinson, D-Solon, said that their proposed map is bipartisan and made with input from Ohioans. They are also worried, since GOP leaders have already said they want a 12-3, or 13-2 Republican majority map.
“The Democratic caucus simply submitted, in public fashion, to the portal — a map,” Robinson said. “It’s not our map, it’s the voters’ map.”
The joint committee has until the end of September to pass a bipartisan map, or else the Ohio Redistricting Commission takes over.
The ORC is made up of seven spots. Two will always go to Republicans and two to Democrats in the legislature. The three remaining seats include the governor, secretary of state and auditor.
The redistricting commission is controlled by the GOP, including Huffman.
“I think that the specific thing… I think the number one thing is that: a lot of people want to talk about 12-3, 13-2 or 10-5, or exactly what it is — we have a process that the voters approved — follow the process.” Huffman said.
He added additional challenges he had faced throughout the years, such as wanting to avoid lawsuits like in previous years, but said that people knew the current redistricting process better now than when it first passed in 2018.
“I think the main thing is: avoid ancillary side conversations that are designed to incite people in Ohio or throughout the United States, stick to the Constitution and make decisions based on that,” the speaker said.
While Huffman promoted teamwork, Democrats were quick to point out how he was called out by the bipartisan Ohio Supreme Court in 2022 for being the ringleader in ignoring anti-gerrymandering laws.
Huffman, who at that time of being reprimanded by the court, sat on the ORC, said Wednesday that he will be appointing someone else as the House representative on the commission.
Still, some Democrats are feeling cautiously optimistic, since Huffman added that he won’t be pressured by the White House’s efforts to gain more seats in Congress. The Trump administration had advocated for this in other states, but most notably, Texas.
“I’m most interested in what residents of the state of Ohio have to say,” Huffman said when asked about Trump and national influence. “Of course, the President of the United States is an important person too, but there are 11 million+ people in the state of Ohio.”
Trump, the members of Congress and citizens all have a right to lobby about what they want, he said — but Ohioans are who he cares about.
“The state of Ohio is a sovereign entity… We make decisions about what is going on,” he said.
The lawmakers will determine the maps, and if bipartisanship can be reached, the speaker continued.
“We have to have 50 votes to pass the map, and what I think are unreasonable demands aren’t going to get passed,” he said.
When pressed further about Trump, Huffman reiterated that any president of any party would like to have more members of their party in Congress.
“I don’t think the president’s going to call Matt Huffman and say, ‘Here’s what I want,’ or anything like that…” the speaker said. “There are so many specifics to this and constitutional mandates that that’s really what’s going to guide us here.”
The first redistricting meeting is set to take place Sept. 22. Huffman doesn’t think it’s possible to pass a bipartisan map by the Sept. 30 deadline; thus, the ORC would have to take over for the next part of the process.
Ohio is redrawing congressional districts. What does that mean?

Deadlines and process
Sept. 30: The lawmakers need to pass a map with at least 60% in each chamber with at least 50% support of Democrats.
If that fails, it goes to the ORC.
Oct. 31: To meet this deadline, at least four members of the ORC, including two Republicans and two Democrats, must approve.
If that fails, it goes back to the legislature.
Nov. 30: This map can also pass with just a simple majority, and the map must be replaced after six years.

Mike DeWine has extended the state’s National Guard troops’ deployment to Washington, D.C. until the end of November.
This month, 150 troops were expected to come home from patrolling the nation’s capital — but those plans just got delayed.
“I really think it damages morale,” veteran and state Sen. Casey Weinstein, D-Hudson, said. “It really damages the institution.”
Weinstein is disappointed in DeWine after he extended the 30-day surge in D.C. for 60 more days.
The original mission was to combat what President Donald Trump called a rise in crime.
“Over the last year, it was a very unsafe place,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “Over the last 20 years, actually, it was very unsafe.”
Violent crime is at a 30-year low, according to D.C. police. Recently, troops have been spotted cleaning up trash and performing landscaping tasks. A Joint Task Force–District of Columbia Spokesperson told us that Ohio troops haven’t been on trash patrol, though.
“Out there on a mission that they’re not even clear is a real need, right?” Weinstein said. “Doing mulch or picking up trash — to me, that is a degradation of what the guard is supposed to represent.”
But after a month, President Donald Trump said his mission of making the capital safer had been accomplished.
“Now, it’s got virtually no crime,” Trump said. “We call it ‘crime-free.'”
So why are Ohio troops still there?
“I talked to the head of the Washington, D.C. National Guard,” DeWine said Wednesday. “One of the things he said to me is: ‘Governor, you having people out here allows my people not to have to work 14, 16-hour days.'”
Ohio troops being in the D.C. allows for the police to tackle violent crime, the governor’s team said, while National Guard members are patrolling buildings.
“To me, that’s a very good reason for us to continue to have the guard there to back the guard up there,” DeWine said.
The governor has been standing by this decision because he said he tends to accept every ask for help, like he has done in the past for both Republican and Democratic leaders of other states during natural disasters or from mayors when there is civil unrest in Ohio cities.
“This is something that deserves extra scrutiny, particularly in the way that this deployment and this extension are being politicized,” Weinstein said.
Trump’s emergency declaration to take over D.C. just expired, but that doesn’t change anything with the National Guard as long as DeWine approved their deployment.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)The reinterpretation of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 by the current administration is not just another policy shift buried in bureaucratic jargon. It is a betrayal — a betrayal of immigrants, a betrayal of communities of color and, perhaps most corrosively, a betrayal of the very institutions and organizations that once claimed to uphold diversity, equity and inclusion as core values.
The new guidance makes clear that immigrants, regardless of how deeply rooted they are in our communities, will face new barriers to education, resources and opportunity. It has led public institutions such as Johnson County Community College and Kansas City, Kansas, Community College to announce they will begin requiring immigration documents for enrollment in certain programs. These are the same institutions that, less than a year ago, proudly advertised their campuses as “welcoming to all” and wove DEI principles into their mission statements.
That those commitments could unravel so quickly should alarm us all.
It forces us to ask hard questions: Were those values ever authentic? Or were they convenient talking points — easy to put in glossy brochures when it cost nothing, but discarded the moment political pressure mounted? The rapid retreat suggests that for many institutions, DEI was never a true pillar, but a facade.
This betrayal isn’t confined to higher education. Cities and municipalities across the country, once eager to celebrate diversity and enact inclusive ordinances, are now preemptively dismantling programs meant to serve immigrants and other marginalized groups. These actions are framed as compliance with federal shifts, but in truth, they represent a cowardly eagerness to align with racist values rather than defend the humanity of all residents.
The hypocrisy stings all the more because it undermines the very communities that sustain our cities and colleges. Immigrants and communities of color are not peripheral contributors — they are central to our economic prosperity, our culture and the very idea of America as a thriving, pluralistic society. The erasure of their access to education and opportunity not only weakens individuals but hollows out the collective strength of our communities.
The question is not only how such betrayals will harm us now, but also what happens when this dark chapter eventually ends. Because history teaches us that it will end. Extremist policies never stand forever. But when we emerge from this moment, how will institutions rebuild trust with the people they so callously abandoned? Will communities of color and immigrant families forgive and return to schools, organizations and cities that once shut their doors in their faces? Should they?
Repair will not come easily. Trust cannot simply be declared restored; it must be earned back through courage, consistency and action. Institutions will have to prove — through policy, not platitudes — that they are willing to stand up for the very people they once excluded. Communities will rightfully be wary of shallow gestures.
In the meantime, silence is not an option. It is up to us — residents, students, educators, advocates, neighbors — to use our voices and demand accountability. We must make clear that these harmful actions are not reflective of the values of our communities. We know what builds healthy, prosperous communities: opportunity for all, regardless of immigration status. When people are able to learn, work, and live without fear, entire neighborhoods flourish. That truth does not change with the tides of political power.
This is not the time for cowardice. It is the time for leaders, especially in education and local government, to double down and prove their values are more than marketing slogans. It is the time to resist policies that divide, to stand up for the people who enrich our campuses, workplaces and neighborhoods, and to insist that diversity and inclusion are not negotiable.
The betrayal we are witnessing is painful and profound. But it is not permanent — if, and only if, enough of us refuse to accept it. The question that hangs in the balance is whether our institutions will continue to bend the knee to racist ideologies, or whether they will summon the courage to live up to their promises. For the sake of our future, the choice is theirs. The responsibility to hold them to it is ours.

Ron DeSantis, want to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida law as well as rules and regulations. (Stock photo by Getty Images)To: The Nebraska Legislature
From: A constituent 
Re: Don’t be like Florida
As the 49 current Nebraskans who write laws and make policies that affect the way and quality of life for the rest of us Cornhuskers, please don’t be like Florida. 
Maybe it’s the heat or the humidity or the alligators or the hurricanes, but the Sunshine State drove its public health bus deep into Everglades muck when it became the first state to do away with school vaccine requirements. 
It did so without any research into what the absence of a vaccine mandate for school children would do to the overall health of the state. I’m neither a doctor nor do I play one in op-ed commentaries, but that calculus sounds neither healthy nor wise. 
One might go as far as to think Florida is making it up as it goes along.
So, dear state senators, please do some bud nipping if such an idea arrives in your email inbox, at a neighborhood barbecue or on the Unicameral floor. Obviously, Nebraska looks to other states for best practices in solving common problems. Why reinvent the wheel, right? 
Florida’s anti-vax idea, however, should be neither emulated nor entertained. Contrary to information from officials there, including the state’s surgeon general and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, we have the data. Vaccines work. Full stop.
Florida’s no-poke plan begins in January and excludes vaccine requirements for hepatitis B, chickenpox, Hib influenza and pneumococcal diseases, such as meningitis. The Florida Legislature also convenes in January and would have to vote to remove requirements for measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, mumps and tetanus individually, a distinct possibility given the current vaccine vibe among state leaders.
We insist on sending children to school in enclosed spaces to get an education, so we require inoculations to foster the public good … in this case public health. While vaccine requirements are generally left up to the states, the U.S. Supreme Court has been clear for 120 years: States may require schoolchildren to be vaccinated to increase the health and safety of all students. 
Without those protections, chances increase that children will contract and spread communicable diseases, even to the vaccinated because as doctors and epidemiologists point out, no vaccine can guarantee 100% efficacy. 
As infected students interact with families, medical professionals at hospitals and clinics and in the general public, everyone’s risk increases, especially those whose immune systems may be compromised from chemotherapy, post-op complications or even age, making grandma and grandpa more vulnerable than they have to be. 
Measles is a sad case in point. According to the Journal of American Medicine, as vaccination rates have fallen since the pandemic, measles cases have risen, especially worrisome because the percentage of vaccinated has fallen below 95, the gold standard for herd immunity. The CDC reports that in 2020, the U.S. had 13 cases of measles. In 2025, the number is 1,431. Twelve percent of those individuals had to be hospitalized. Three died.
Florida argues that the government should not be mandating vaccines because individuals should have autonomy over their bodies — and what goes in them. Fair enough, although such logic and sentiment fail to square with the state’s highly restrictive abortion ban (nothing after six weeks). 
Florida’s decision is yet another chorus of the noisy and occasionally nonsensical chirping coming from the federal HHS, with its vaccine-skeptic leader and his apparently like-minded new advisory board. To date, research money has been pulled from mRNA research, which gave us the COVID vaccine. HHS has also added restrictions to the vaccine’s availability. 
In response to such dissonance, four states on the other side of the country, California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii have formed an alliance to give its citizens data-driven, scientifically-sound vaccine recommendations. Several New England states are also considering such a collaboration. 
The freedoms and rights woven into a democratic republic’s constitutional principles require both personal and civic responsibilities. John F. Kennedy, before he became president, once said as a U.S. Senator, “In a democracy, every citizen is in a position of responsibility, regardless of their interest in politics.” 
Requiring vaccines for school children — out of respect for their health, their families’ health and their community’s health — seems a fitting example of his idea. So go ahead, senators, tackle property taxes, address budget deficits, reconsider term limits, whatever. Argue, debate, spit, even cuss if you must. But keep our schoolchildren — and the rest of us — safe.

(Photo by Rosanne Skirble for Maryland Matters)By reframing child care from a commodity into a human right, we can shift the conversation away from whether or not child care is possible to being beneficial to families, housing stabilization and sustaining the precarious transition to independent adulthood.
Based on international principles like the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the widespread belief that every child has a right to care that is nurturing, safe, and supportive, this is not some radical transformation – it should be commonplace.
Despite this, in the U.S., infant and toddler care is viewed as a market good and not a piece of essential public infrastructure. In 2022, Organization for Economic and Community Development member nations averaged spending of over $14,000 per child annually, and the U.S. spent less than $500 explicitly on child care. This allows countless families to spend up to 32% of their income on care.
Affordable, reliable care can also be recognized as a silent linchpin to housing stability. Parents experiencing child care challenges, not limited to but including single parents and low-income families, also suffer the stress of relying on absent employment. When parents cannot care for their children, they become uninsured and their providers turn into commensurate, obligated equivalents.
Governments fare better in prioritizing and funding child care and supporting families when they value human development and quality of life over market-based decisions.

For example, for ALICE [Asset Limited, Income-Constrained, Employed] families in Maryland, child care is frequently their top monthly expense. At 38% of the survival budget, these families will not foster slow or sudden economic independence.
Beyond high levels of associated stress and reduced well-being, most reports suggest that for these families, as part of the 45% of Maryland’s parents of children age 3 and younger, we lose $2.41 billion in productivity for employers from employment disruption resulting from gaps in child care. One report estimated that Maryland loses $117 million annually in state tax revenue from parents in this population missing significant employment.
When child care falls apart, housing often follows: The rent gets paid late, eviction risk rises, or worse, individuals become homeless. Emerging adults between the ages of 18 to 25 are further impacted. This life stage provides a tenuous bridge for young people beginning careers, pursuing education and establishing their own households.
For young parents, having steady support is critical. Research points to the fact that access to quality child care translates to better long-term educational outcomes, job stability, and upward mobility.
Current research, “Exploring the Perspectives of Emerging Adults in Public Housing: Workforce Development, Economic Mobility and Structural Barriers,” provides evidence of these relationships with the voices of 18 emerging adults in public housing who were part of workforce development programs. It found that structural barriers, including the cost of child care and transportation, severely hamper their ability to sustain employment or even contemplate a stable future.
Without consistent child care, these young parents’ options are more limited to dropping out, further income loss, and housing insecurity. With child care, the young parents can find stability, grow their households and fully participate in their communities.
Maryland is just beginning to turn things around. Family support centers support student parents in completing their education and entering the workforce. These intergenerational approaches are an example of working models but are too limited in scale. What we also need is a universal, bold initiative; child care, like public education or libraries, public, consistent, and universal. Such an initiative could enhance household stability, encourage job sustainability and allow an emerging adult the opportunity to thrive in adulthood.
If we treat child care as a human right, then we need to invest in it. This means universal, publicly funded child care available to all; living wages and training for caregivers; and coordination of child care with housing support and child/traditionally youth-focused services.
One of our neighbors, Canada, has a successful model with the investment of $27 billion in making child care less than $10/day in many provinces. If Maryland could add this type of change to their current housing and youth services, we could realize the results would evidence fewer evictions, growing family resilience and engaged, enthusiastic emerging adults with the confidence to step into their futures.
Caring is more than compassion; it is a civil, economic, and social infrastructure. Universal child care is more than children’s rights; it is about building a stronger, more stable and more equitable Maryland.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/thumbnail_6_cropped-e1757921006279-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-15 03:57:21.648575

(Photo courtesy Bryce Mitchell/University of Florida)Retailers tell us Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year.
Please.
We barbarians, defenders of the indefensible, rationalizers of blown knees and brain damage, know college football season is the most wonderful time of the year, four months when it’s perfectly OK to make animal noises and behave like 7th graders on meth, display irrational hatreds, eat appalling food, and shout at people on television to whom we have not been introduced.
I am a victim of this madness.
Or perhaps I’m a perpetrator.
I can tell you every single thing that’s wrong with college football: its celebration of brutality, its fetishization of the hyper-masculine, its gleeful embrace of tribalism.
Look at the injuries: shredded ligaments, broken spines, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) from hundreds upon hundreds of sub-concussive hits.
Look at the money: For all you anti-education dolts out there whining that college professors get paid too much, the average faculty salary in Florida is around $75,000 a year, which sounds pretty good until you compare it to what football players at UF, FSU, or USF are paid: anywhere from $100,000 (for a pretty good freshman) to $1 million-plus for a hot QB.
And the coaches? The University of Florida’s Billy Napier makes $7.4 million a year.
However, the poor bugger may soon be sacked. His Gators have now lost two in a row, first to USF, then to LSU. But don’t feel too bad for Napier. He’ll get $22 million if UF has to buy out hos contract.
If the Bull Gators, sufficiently incensed by USF’s upset of his team, fire him, he’ll get even richer: It’ll take to buy him out.
Ain’t capitalism grand?
Look at the retrograde gender roles: gigantic armor-clad men beating hell out of each other on the field while tiny women in short skirts with little girl bows on their heads cheer them on.
Addiction, hypocrisy
Look at the team mascots: Notre Dame’s pugilistic Leprechaun with his dubious facial hair, representing an Irishman who, as we all know, wants nothing more than to get in a fight; or the University of North Carolina’s Ramses, an angry sheep in a sweater; or Florida State’s Osceola, a white frat boy impersonating a multiracial Seminole war leader who was betrayed by the United States and died in a South Carolina prison.
Look at the confusion of football with war: the military flyovers, the presentation of colors, calling the quarterback (who throws “bombs”) a “field general.”
Given the game is all about invading your enemy’s territory, I guess it makes sense.
Football, unrepentantly violent, irrationally angry, hopelessly parochial — that’s 21st Century America. (Getty Images)
Certainly made sense to the South’s historically white universities which, until the 1970s, saw college football games (especially against Yankee teams) as a Johnny Reb do-over of the Civil War, complete with battle flags, bands playing “Dixie,” and comparisons to Gettysburg.
People, this stuff is flat-out weird.
Nevertheless, I am a lifer, an addict, and a hopeless hypocrite.
Culture is a tough old bird and college football has sunk roots as deep as a live oak into my culture.
I was raised in Tallahassee; “FSU” is tattooed on the inside of my brain; I’ve been going to games since I was nine years old.
I know the all the words to the FSU “Fight Song,” the “Alma Mater,” and “Hymn to the Garnet and Gold.”
I watched (or attended) every single FSU game last year — that would be the Seminoles’ 2-10 season.
Painful. But then, to love college football (especially FSU football) is to learn to suffer.
(Listen: There’s nothing you can say to me I haven’t already said to myself).
Pick a team!
It used to be said baseball was America’s Game. As the great George Carlin pointed out, baseball is played in a park by people in caps, not helmets, and in baseball, the “object is to go home.”
If that was ever true, it ain’t anymore. Football, unrepentantly violent, irrationally angry, hopelessly parochial — that’s 21st Century America.
It’s who we are.
From the White House on down, the country has finally caught up with college football’s 150 years of tribalism: You are Red or Blue, you are one of us or you are the enemy.
If you are the enemy, you must be crushed.
The South is the beating heart of college football and Florida — no matter how many Ohioans move here — is a Southern state.
College football matters here, so much so the governor grouses about it when teams that used to be good are not good anymore.
Last year, he criticized the transfer portal and declared a Florida team should always be playing for the national championship like in the good old days when the Seminoles, the Gators, and the Hurricanes bestrode the gridiron like shoulder-padded gods.
College football, however, is one of the long list of things DeSantis does not understand.
He thinks he should be for whatever Florida team is playing against whatever non-Florida team, so he shows up at last year’s FSU-Georgia Tech game in Ireland and says he’ll attend this year’s UF-Texas match this October.
This is not how you do it.
You pick a team. You are loyal to that team.
Former Gov. Jeb Bush was a Hurricane; former Governor Lawton Chiles was a Gator; former Speaker of the House T.K. Wetherell was a Seminole.
They did not pander.
Bread and circuses
At this moment, college football programs still need colleges to attach themselves to. The university is a kind of beard, lending cover, a facade of “student-athlete” respectability.
UM, USF, FSU, and UF are pretty much pro teams now, but no one wants to admit this, least of all the universities.
University presidents and trustees know winning football teams mean higher alumni donations and higher enrolments.
How long can this charade go on?
DeSantis has made it clear he thinks Florida universities — the non-sports parts — are his enemies, bastions of wokery, and means to whip them into line with his shiny new, as-yet-unpeopled accreditation body.
The “Commission for Public Higher Education” is supposed to replace the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) which, DeSantis claims, tried to force Florida universities to “do DEI.”
Those of us out here in the reality-based community can tell you SACS never demanded anybody “do DEI.”
The accreditor did express disapproval of DeSantis’s attempt to stop three UF professors from testifying as expert witnesses in a voting-rights case — it’s called academic freedom — but since when does truth stop a gubernatorial temper tantrum? And people wonder why a third of faculty in Florida are looking for jobs outside of Florida.
OK, back to the important stuff, i.e. football. How can a progressive justify loving the game?
I can’t. Not really.
The world is particularly bleak right now: The president of the United States is enabling (if passively) Putin’s invasion of Ukraine; the people of Gaza are starving; the people of Sudan are starving; the planet is choking on greenhouse gases.
Here in America, free expression is under attack, we’re shooting each other on the regular, and masked goons are rounding up brown folks and throwing them into gulags.
You can grant all the criticisms, the heartfelt and rational objections, but seeing FSU whip Alabama was a moment of sheer joy.
Even watching third- and fourth-string Seminoles beat the tar out of the unfortunate Lions of East Texas A&M (I know: cupcake) was a feast of elegant passes, beautiful runs, and actual (rare for FSU) blocking.
It won’t last. The Miami game is coming.
Yes, football is bread and circuses, a distraction, inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.
But sometimes a little bread and a gridiron circus is just what a body needs.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-15 04:01:56+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut should resist the push for a fossil fuel future,Shannon Laun,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/15/connecticut-should-resist-the-push-for-a-fossil-fuel-future/,The attempt to shut down Revolution Wind shows that Trump is hell-bent on replacing renewable energy projects with price-volatile gas.,"New England has been called the “Saudi Arabia of wind” for our exceptional offshore wind resources, which have enormous potential to power our economy and provide local jobs. But now Trump has halted construction on a nearly finished wind project that was on track to power more than 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
The unprecedented and likely illegal attempt to shut down Revolution Wind is the latest evidence that Trump is hell-bent on replacing clean, job-producing, and affordable solar and wind projects in New England with price-volatile gas from out of state. If Trump and his fossil fuel cronies prevail, they’ll drive up our energy costs, harm our health, and throttle our opportunities for local economic development.

Shannon Laun
The Trump administration has our clean energy economy in its crosshairs. Federal agencies are on a mission to find new bureaucratic means of stopping clean energy projects that are already financed and under construction or fully permitted. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has been meeting with political leaders in the northeast to demand that they concede to new gas pipelines that do not have financial support and are unlikely to reduce energy costs. 
If the administration and the fossil fuel industry get their way, New England families and businesses could be stuck with expensive bills to pay for gas infrastructure and price-volatile gas for years after Zeldin and President Trump are long gone.
In Connecticut, Governor Lamont doesn’t seem to grasp that investing in new gas pipelines would be costly and shortsighted. While Lamont supports the state’s climate goals, he has cravenly agreed with Trump’s demand to expand gas pipelines in the region. Lamont claims he’s responding to high electricity rates, but new gas pipelines are not the answer. In fact, investors have been unwilling to finance new pipelines in the region because they’re not a viable investment and there are no buyers for long-term gas contracts. 
What Zeldin and Lamont seem to forget is that New England has been here before. In 2016, the region rejected a similar push for new gas pipelines. When the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that it was not legal to charge electric customers for the high cost of a pipeline and the Maine utility regulator determined that the plan was not cost-effective, those plans fell like a house of cards.
What Lamont is really doing is bowing to pressure from Trump and the fossil fuel industry at the expense of the people he represents. Industry front groups with deceptive names like Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future and Consumers Energy Alliance are mobilizing in support of fossil fuels and attacking clean energy. They release pro-fossil fuel studies and surveys of questionable accuracy while receiving funding from fossil fuel companies, or in the case of Mass Fiscal Alliance, refusing to say who funds them. 
Despite the fossil fuel industry’s attempts to strangle clean energy, deployment has exploded across the U.S. and globally. Nationally, solar, wind, and batteries dominate as we race to add new sources of electricity to meet growing demand. Solar is the cheapest and fastest growing source of energy in the U.S. and globally. 
But the transition to clean energy in the U.S. is not happening fast enough to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil fuels. The Trump administration is making things worse by taking unprecedented – and often illegal – actions to slow the transition and continue inflating the profits of fossil fuel companies, which already enjoy huge government subsidies. 
The Trump administration’s support for fossil fuels is purely ideological and unbelievably myopic. Nationally, 90 percent of new capacity added to the grid is from solar and wind. In the winter, wind power – a free and local resource – ramps up just when we need it most. In summer, abundant sunshine makes solar an excellent source of power. During the heat wave that hit the region this summer, rooftop solar and batteries saved us from losing power – and saved consumers almost $20 million in fuel costs.
Revolution Wind created 1,200 jobs in New England and was on the cusp of providing Connecticut and Rhode Island with clean electricity. If Trump succeeds in killing the project, he will destroy jobs, increase energy costs, and threaten grid reliability.
When the federal government does the bidding of multibillion dollar corporations while driving up costs for the average American, we need states to step up. Our state and local leaders have a responsibility to lead where this administration has failed us: by investing in clean, local, and affordable sources of energy, enabling families and businesses to access clean technologies that are more efficient and better for our health, and refuting Trump’s nonsensical claims that fossil fuels are the future. 
Not in New England, they aren’t.

Home to Bangor, a city of roughly 32,000, the county has identified 28 new cases over nearly two years. That’s seven times the typical number for that length of time. Nearly all cases are among people who use drugs and are homeless.
Public health experts and local advocates say the outbreak is fueled by a confluence of on-the-ground factors: the sidelining and closing of programs that distributed sterile syringes to people who use drugs, a shortage of medical providers focused on HIV, and the clearing of the city’s largest homeless encampment, which upended care for newly diagnosed people living there.
But those issues may not remain local for long.
The Trump administration is pushing similar tactics nationwide. In a recent executive order, Trump called for defunding programs that engage in harm reduction — a broad term that encompasses many public health interventions, including syringe services, aimed at keeping people who use drugs alive. Such efforts are sometimes controversial, with critics saying they enable illegal activity. The executive order also supports forcing homeless people off the street and into treatment. This comes after the administration cut or delayed funding for various addiction and HIV-related programs and hollowed out federal agencies focused on these topics.
The administration says its approach will increase public safety, but decades of research suggest otherwise. Many advocates and researchers warn these efforts could spark more outbreaks like the one in Bangor.
“That feels inevitable,” said Laura Pegram, director of Drug User Health for NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs.
She said people who use drugs face a trifecta of risks: HIV, hepatitis C, and overdose. “Across the country, I think we’ll start to see those three things starting to be on the rise again.”
“That will be incredibly costly,” she added — in dollars and “in a real human way.”
Outbreaks that start among people who use drugs can easily spread to those who don’t.
Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, was a Bangor-area nonprofit that distributed more than half a million sterile needles a year to people who use drugs. The organization ran out of supplies repeatedly in the lead-up to the first HIV case of the current outbreak in October 2023, and it shut down in early 2025. (Photo courtesy of Amy Clark)
 An HIV outbreak

The first HIV case in Bangor’s current outbreak appeared in October 2023, well before Trump’s return to the presidency.
Puthiery Va, director of Maine’s public health department, attributed the emergence to the opioid epidemic, housing shortages, and the greater Bangor area’s sparse health care services.
Local advocates highlighted an additional, acute factor: supply shortages at the region’s largest syringe services program and its subsequent closure.
A nonprofit that provided health care and social services to people who use drugs, Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, distributed more than half a million sterile needles annually.
Like other such programs nationwide, its goal was to prevent the spread of infectious disease that can occur if people share needles to inject drugs.
However, financial struggles and mismanagement led to severe shortages in recent years. Former HEAL executive director Josh D’Alessio acknowledged such issues, telling KFF Health News, “We did run out of syringes” at times or limit how many participants could take. Several of these shortages struck in the fall of 2023, leading HEAL staffers to suggest a link to the first HIV case.

 The future of harm reduction

Research suggests a strong connection between past HIV outbreaks among people who use drugs and lack of access to sterile needles, said Thomas Stopka, an epidemiologist at Tufts University School of Medicine.
A 2015 outbreak in Scott County, Indiana, and one in the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts a few years later were curbed only after syringe services programs ramped up, he said. If such programs had existed sooner in Scott County, more than a hundred infections could have been prevented, one study suggested.
Va, who leads the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said she considers the shortage of syringe services in the Bangor area to be a factor in the outbreak but not the primary cause.
Stopka said the best practice during an outbreak “is to amplify access to sterile syringes.”
But Trump’s recent executive order links harm-reduction programs to crime, saying such efforts “only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm.” The order doesn’t name syringe services programs — which have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the past — but it targets “safe consumption” sites, where people can use drugs under supervision. Many advocates worry the attacks will be broader.
A letter from the nation’s leading addiction agency expanding on Trump’s executive order said federal funds cannot be used to buy syringes or drug pipes. However, that has been true for most of the past few decades. The letter did not address supporting general operating costs for syringe services programs.
Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News that the administration is committed to “addressing the addiction and overdose crisis impacting communities across our nation.” But he and spokespeople for the White House did not respond to specific questions about the administration’s stance toward syringe services.
In Bangor, some locals have raised concerns about harm reduction that echo the president’s. At a March 2024 City Council meeting — shortly after a syringe services program was newly certified by the state to operate locally — residents and business owners said they felt unsafe with the growing population of people who were homeless and using drugs. They worried syringe programs were fueling the behavior.
But research suggests syringe services programs reduce discarded needles in the community and do not increase crime. They can halve new HIV and hepatitis C cases, increase entry into addiction treatment fivefold, and save taxpayer money. They are also leading distributors of overdose reversal medications, the use of which many communities — and the Trump administration — have said they support.
The city ultimately decided the newly certified program, Needlepoint Sanctuary, could not operate in prominent public parks or squares.
In the following months, Needlepoint ran its syringe services only at the city’s largest homeless encampment, where several people had tested positive for HIV, said the group’s executive director, William “Willie” Hurley. That ended in February when the city cleared the encampment.
This summer, Needlepoint secured a private location for its syringe services but shut it down five days later when city officials raised zoning concerns.
Jennifer Gunderman, director of Bangor’s health department, said the city is trying to strike a balance between “making services available and what the community wants.”
“Getting the buy-in of most of the community” is “critical to the future of harm reduction,” she said.
Other cities in Maine and beyond have seen backlash result in new laws that restrict how syringe services programs operate or shutter them.
Gunderman said she is hoping to avoid that in Bangor.

 Clearing encampments

Trump’s recent executive order also calls for clearing homeless people off the street and involuntarily committing them to treatment facilities.
The administration is enacting this policy in Washington, D.C., where it has bulldozed tents and threatened homeless people with fines and jail time if they don’t leave the streets.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said people have the option to be taken to a shelter or receive addiction and mental health services.
Similar policies have taken hold nationwide in recent years, even in liberal hubs like New York and California.
Last year in Bangor, as a homeless encampment that had existed for several years grew to nearly 100 residents, business owners and locals called for its clearing.
Some advocates and social service providers warned that doing so could exacerbate the HIV outbreak and overdose crisis. At two City Council meetings in November, they explained that it would be difficult to find people they served after a clearing and that scattering newly diagnosed people could spark HIV clusters elsewhere.
“Plenty of people said you’re going to lose track of these people,” Amy Clark, a board member for the Bangor Area Recovery Network, told KFF Health News. “They did it anyway.”
 ‘I’m still alive’

Two months after clearing the encampment, the city reported not knowing the location of more than a third of the people who had lived there.
Clark said it’s not surprising that the city couldn’t connect everyone to housing or treatment. Many people distrust these services, shelters are frequently full, and treatment services are scarce. “Where exactly are these people supposed to go?” she said.
City officials stressed in Council meetings and reports that they were taking a humane approach. They ramped up social services for months leading up to the clearing, connecting people to everything from housing to storage facilities and laundry.
Gunderman, the city health director, said she knows the sweep wasn’t ideal but that neither was crowding folks in an unsanitary encampment. “It was a situation where there weren’t a lot of great answers,” she said.
To help track folks from the encampment and keep them engaged in HIV treatment, the city is now using about $550,000 in opioid settlement funds to hire two case managers. (The only other local HIV medical case management program shuttered over the summer.)
“What we know from outreach we’ve been doing already is that we spend a lot of time looking for people,” Gunderman said.
Jason, who has been homeless for most of the past decade and tested positive for HIV this year, has seen that in action.
Members of what he calls his medical team have scoured the streets for hours to find his tent and remind him to take his HIV treatment shots, he said. Some picked up prescriptions and delivered them to him.
“They’ve made sure I’m taken care of,” Jason said. (KFF Health News agreed to use only his first name to protect his privacy.)
Jason believes he got the virus last year at the homeless encampment while using drugs that someone else prepared. He had tried to avoid the encampment for months. But whenever he set up his tent elsewhere, he said, police officers told him to move.
When he got the diagnosis, he thought of his uncle, who died of AIDS in the 1980s.
“It hurts to talk about,” Jason said, “but I’m still alive.”
After months of treatment, his viral load is now undetectable. Over the summer, his team helped him find housing.
But Jason is still struggling to find sterile needles regularly. He worries about others facing a shortage.
“That’s how this outbreak has been spreading more and more,” Jason said. “Every time we turn around there’s another case.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)CEDAR RAPIDS — U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, officially launching her U.S. Senate campaign Sunday, said Iowa Republicans can’t be complacent in 2026 if they want President Donald Trump to be able to accomplish his agenda.
The Marion Republican announced her run earlier in September, hours after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said she would not seek reelection in 2026. After entering the race, Hinson quickly consolidated support from national Republican leaders, gaining endorsements from Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott.
Hinson has pledged to be Trump’s “strongest ally” in the U.S. Senate if elected, saying she will support the president’s agenda on issues like immigration, education and agriculture. At the Sunday event, she reiterated her support for the Trump administration’s agenda, saying her campaign was “embarking on a journey to continue fighting alongside President Trump, to transform the America First agenda into our America First future.”

“I’m incredibly grateful to have earned the support of our great president, President Donald J. Trump,” Hinson said. “I am honored to fight alongside him to fix what Joe Biden broke. We are putting America first, and we are making America great again. Mr. President, I want to say thank you for your support. I will not let you down.”
Speaking to supporters, Hinson said she was focused on issues like border security, deporting undocumented immigrants, and stopping transgender women from competing in women’s sports. She also said she would continue her work on issues like supporting Iowa farmers and “strengthening Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security for our seniors” if elected to the Senate.
Hinson, who was first elected to represent Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District in 2020, described herself as a “mama bear who refuses to stand by and allow my kids to grow up in a country run by liberals who want to ditch the American experiment and set up some kind of crazy liberal dystopia.” She said “radical left lunacy” has harmed states like California and New York — and that Democrats running for the U.S. Senate seat want Iowa to become more like these states.
“That’s the vision the Democrats in this race in Iowa are fighting for,” Hinson said. “They want to push Iowa to the coasts. They want to push our country past the brink. Guess what? I’m not going to let them do that.”
There are currently four Democrats competing to become the party’s nominee in the 2026 Senate race — state Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville; state Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs; former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage and Des Moines school board chair Jackie Norris.
All four candidates spoke at the Polk County Democrats’ Steak Fry in Des Moines Saturday about the race and said their approaches to the campaign trail will not change despite shifts in the competition.
Hinson called out Wahls specifically at the event, referring to the state senator a “far-left” Democrat who is pretending to be a moderate, “hoping to fool Iowans into believing that they share our values.” She made a joke that Iowans “rejected the last Walz,” referring to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 presidential election who has a similar last name, and said “we’ll do the same for this one.”
Wahls told reporters Saturday Hinson has supported the same policies as Ernst that are unpopular with Iowans which contribute to a “broken economy” and political corruption in Washington. “Whether it’s Joni Ernst, Ashley Hinson, I think Iowans understand that Washington leaders have failed our state and they’re ready to change,” Wahls said.
While Hinson has emerged as a frontrunner for the GOP nomination after Ernst left the race, former state legislator Jim Carlin and former Libertarian candidate Joshua Smith are also vying for the Republican nomination.
Hinson said Iowans support her and Trump’s policies — and have shown their support by electing Republicans across the ballot in recent election cycles — but she also warned the 2026 election will be difficult, and said “Democrats are not just going to fade silently into the night.”
“Sure, today, it seems like they are pretty much a joke, right?” Hinson said. “They don’t have a leader, they don’t have a message, and they really don’t have a clue what to do about it. … We cannot rest on our laurels, though, and I think we all know that we have not come this far to only go this far. We have to keep Iowa red when it comes to the Senate, when it comes to our governor’s race, all of our statewide offices, our congressional seats and our leaders in the legislature. If we keep Iowa red, we will help make sure President Trump can have a full four years of wins and deliver results for you that will last for a generation and beyond.”

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)
If you watched Ole Miss out-score Arkansas 41-35 Saturday night, you know this: Rebel quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, a transfer Division II from Ferris (Michigan) State, can play. He is the real deal. He can run. He can throw. He has the “it” factor.
The Ole Miss roster lists Chambliss  at 6-foot-1, and he might be 6 feet tall in his spikes, which is probably why he played first at Ferris State and not at Michigan or Michigan State. But he runs like a halfback, and throws with accuracy and zip. He makes good decisions, and he makes plays. 

Rick Cleveland
Chambliss led Ferris State to the Division II national championship last year throwing for a gazillion yards and running for a zillion more. He produced 51 touchdowns in a single football season, which is crazy good in any league.
But still, it’s a gigantic leap from the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference to the SEC. Chambliss has played before more fans in two SEC games than he did in his entire career at Ferris State, located in Big Rapids, Michigan, in the west central part of the state. The Ferris State stadium is called a field and seats about 6,000, although that many seats are rarely needed.
Chambliss played well in relief duty a week earlier when Ole Miss starter Austin Simmons suffered an ankle injury at Kentucky. Making his first SEC start against Arkansas, he threw for 353 yards and a touchdown and ran 62 yards and two touchdowns. He was, in a word, terrific. Lane Kiffin will have an interesting decision to make when Simmons regains his health. It won’t be easy to sit Chambliss back down.
The guess here is we might see Chambliss set a trend across college football. It wouldn’t surprise me if there aren’t a lot more DII players who make the jump. This much I know: There have been plenty of DII players in the past, some right here in Mississippi, who could have played at the next level. 
Exhibit A would be Josh Bright, the splendid Delta State quarterback, who led the Statesmen to the 2000 DII national championship and won the Conerly Trophy in the process. Bright ran coach Steve Campbell’s option offense to perfection, running and passing for more than 1,000 yards. Asked Sunday whether Bright could have played in the SEC, Campbell, who has since coached at several Division I schools, laughed before answering. “You know he could have, you saw him” Campbell said. “Not a doubt in my mind. He was a no-brainer. All you had to do was watch him.”
But you don’t have to take it from Campbell – or me. Back then, I happened to be working on a book with legendary Ole Miss coach John Vaught, who watched on TV as Bright put up 63 points in the national championship game. Said Vaught of Bright, “He damned sure could have played quarterback for me,”
Said Campbell, “We had some other players who could have played at the highest level. Rico McDonald, a running back on that championship team, could have played anywhere in the country.”
At least two other recent Delta State quarterbacks likely could have played big-time college football. Most recently, Patrick Shegog, almost exactly the same size as Chambliss, threw for 32 touchdowns and only two interceptions in 2023, leading the Statesmen to 10 wins. He, too, won the Conerly.
Scott Eyster, a four-year DSU starting quarterback, was a four-time finalist for the Conerly Trophy, a three-time All-American. He threw for 128 touchdowns in four years. That’s all. Ron Roberts, one of his DSU head coaches, is now the defensive coordinator at Florida and has also coached Baylor and Auburn. I texted Roberts Sunday morning, asking if Eyster could have played at the SEC level. “No doubt,” Roberts answered, and then he mentioned that Seth Adams, who played behind Eyster at DSU and transferred to Hinds Community College, eventually wound up starting at quarterback for Ole Miss.
Eyster, now the principal at Bay High in Bay St. Louis, says he has no regrets about his Delta State career, but knows in his heart he could have played DI football. He said he was contacted by Mississippi State about the possibility of transferring. “But back then, I would have had to sit out a year and there was no NIL money,” Eyster said. “It wasn’t worth it. Plus, I loved Delta State. They were good to me there. I have to admit, I’d be a lot more tempted now that you don’t have to sit out a season when you transfer and there’s all that NIL money.”
Fast Freddie McAfee could have played for anybody, too, when he helped Mississippi College to a DII national championship. Indeed, he did play for five different teams in a 16-year NFL career. Vicksburg native Malcolm Butler played his college football at DII West Alabama, before he became famous for making a Super Bowl-saving interception for the New England Patriots. 
Campbell, the national championship coach of Bright at Delta State, once played on a DII national championship at Troy State. He well remembers blocking a linebacker named Jessie Tuggle, who played at DII Valdosta State, before a long career with the Atlanta Falcons.
“Everybody should remember who Jessie Tuggle was,” Campbell said. “His name is on the stadium in Atlanta. He was a load.”
Tuggle probably was overlooked by the SEC powerhouses because he stood only 5 feet, 11 inches tall, which is still three inches taller than Sam Mills, the linebacker who is both the New Orleans Saints and Carolina Panthers halls of fame. Mills played his college football at Division III Montclair State.
“Here’s the deal,” Steve Campbell continued. “There are great players at every level of college football, especially at the skill positions. It would not surprise me at all if you see more players moving up a level with NIL and the portal.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/14163514/AP25257112784465.jpg,,,2025-09-14 17:57:04.598159

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Apologies, shaming and a state employee’s departure have come to Indiana following insensitive posts and comments about the murder of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.
Kirk was assassinated Sept. 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University.
Indiana’s Department of Child Services posted on social media Saturday, Sept. 13, that a worker was no longer with the agency after making a comment that was in poor taste and “does not reflect the values of this agency or the standards that have been set by this administration.”
“As public servants, state employees are held to a higher standard of conduct and ethics,” the statement continued. “That is certainly the case at the Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) where child welfare and safety are paramount.”
Then, the post asked the public to stop calling Indiana’s Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline to complain about the former employee and also stop calling DCS offices about it.
“Our team members assigned to the hotline work 24/7 to address genuine child safety concerns throughout Indiana’s 92 counties,” the agency said. “Overwhelming the hotline and offices with complaints unrelated to child safety only hampers our ability to respond to emergencies.”
DCS would not confirm if the employee was fired or if she resigned.
Libs of TikTok, a conservative account, highlighted the woman’s statement: “Today was a real pain in the neck but I survived.”
Ball State University is dealing with a similar issue.
“The administration at Ball State University is aware of social media posts by two university employees. Both posts were on the employees’ personal accounts, and the posts do not reflect the culture on our campus nor the enduring values of the university,” the university said in a Friday statement. “The administration is gathering additional information about the posts in order to determine what discipline, if any, is appropriate and permissible under the First Amendment to the Constitution.”
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita also has a message for Hoosiers: “If you have evidence of Indiana educators or school administrators making comments that celebrate or rationalize the assassination of Charlie Kirk, we need to hear from you. These individuals must be held accountable — they have no place teaching our students.”
He encouraged people to submit evidence to his Eyes on Education portal, which previously has been used to report pro-diversity and pro-LGBTQ actions or materials.
Meanwhile, the Bartholomew County Democratic Party apologized for a post it made about Kirk.
The group had posted a news article about Kirk’s death with the comment, “Violent delights have violent ends.”
In a statement, the county party said Kirk “spent a good deal of his time advocating for the second amendment even to the moment that it took his life. In trying to convey the tragedy of this, a quote was taken from a well known Shakespearean tragedy. The quote was a message given that such a great passion like this could result in a terrible end, as this death was. It is obvious that our post was not received in the way it was meant and we are terribly sorry for the hurt it has caused.”
The party continued by saying, “We do empathize greatly with those who have lost people to gun violence and the pain that it brings, so we removed our post and its reminders from our page. We promise to be more mindful about our quote selections in the future. As always, we do not condone gun violence nor violence of any nature no matter what.”
Breitbart also published a story about a staffer for U.S. Rep. André Carson who posted the following on Instagram:
“Charlie Kirk isn’t a martyr. He’s a casualty of the violence he incited.”
“You’re never going to gaslight me into mourning a Nazi. Never.”
Carson has not commented directly on the staffer, but did condemn political violence in a post about receiving a death threat.
“My office received a death threat today — unfortunately, a common occurrence,” he wrote. “Political violence has been normalized for quite some time, and it must end. In this vulnerable time, I join my colleagues across the aisle in calling for compassionate dialogue, not reactionary hate.”

“Our Caucus exists to advance the interests and concerns of African Americans across Michigan – ensuring equitable access to education, homeownership, economic opportunity, and the full promise of the American Dream,” Caucus Chairman Keith Williams said in a statement. “Congresswoman Stevens embodies these values and has proven, through both her record and her vision, that she meets our high standards. We believe that with her leadership and vision, she will be a powerful advocate for our communities and help pave the way toward a more equitable, prosperous Michigan.”
In the race to succeed U.S. Sen. Gary Peters of Bloomfield Township, Steven’s campaign last week also announced the endorsement by Reps. Helena Scott (D-Detroit), Tyrone Carter (D-Detroit), Amos O’Neal (D-Saginaw) and Brenda Carter (D-Pontiac).
Stevens also previously garnered support from former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit), U.S Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids), and former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), among others. 
Stevens will face state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018, in the August 2026 Democratic primary.
On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (D-White Lake) is the sole candidate seeking the nomination.

The timeline of Ed Lazowska’s life in computing doubles as a quick history of the field. From mainframes to PCs to the internet’s public debut in the 1990s and today’s artificial intelligence surge, Lazowska has been both witness and builder.
While he will continue to teach select courses as an emeritus professor at the University of Washington, Lazowsha recently retired and joined Inside Olympia host Austin Jenkins to take stock of a nearly 50-year career in computer science that coincided with the rise of the software industry and the state’s dominant role in it.
He joined the university’s computer science faculty in 1977 and became department chair in 1993. He was the first UW computer science and engineering faculty member elected to the National Academy of Engineering, the first fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the inaugural holder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Chair from 2000 to 2020.
In that role, he was a prime mover behind the infrastructure that let UW scale with Washington’s tech boom. He directed the fundraising campaign for the Paul G. Allen Center, which opened in 2003, and later did the same for the Bill & Melinda Gates Center, a $110 million building that opened in 2019 and doubled the school’s space. Those twin anchors — and the 2017 endowed name change to the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering — expanded degree production and deepened ties with a regional industry that now stretches “from Amazon to Zillow,” with “more than 7,000 engineers” each at Google and Meta in Seattle and Redmond. “We are also, by the way, the center of cloud computing,” he notes. 
That outcome, he argues, was no accident. Washington has spent decades preparing for this moment. “We grew up alongside the industry,” Lazowska says.
Coupled with a track record in research, scholarship and teaching — and outsized advocacy for computing education and entrepreneurship — Lazowska helped turn a strong program into a civic engine that educates talent, anchors research and partners extensively with industry.
Lazowska’s public profile grew in parallel. In addition to roles at the national level, he became a familiar translator at home between campus, Olympia and industry. “I’m a hopeless left winger,” he says with a grin, “but we need to be reasonably pro-business in our cities and in our state,” because the tech sector “is responsible for a fair amount of the resources that allow us to achieve our dreams as a region.”
He views the industry’s cyclical nature with equanimity. After the dot-com bust, the Great Recession and recent post-pandemic layoffs at Microsoft, Oracle, F5 and other companies, his verdict is steady: “Every field has its ups and downs, and computer science has had ups and downs in employment.” The long-term trajectory, he argues, still points up, powered by compounding capability and the elasticity of software demand. The one constant is change — especially now, as artificial intelligence reshapes tools and workflows. “AI caught those of us in the field by surprise,” he says. Even so, he remains bullish: “I’m an optimist. I think that we need to look at applications of AI that are human augmentation rather than human replacement.”
Given the disruption, displacement and volatility, what drew him — and draws students now — to the discipline? Lazowska offers two answers. The narrow one: “All of us like rapid instant gratification. And when you write a computer program and it runs, there’s instant gratification … it’s an intellectual exercise. You’re solving a puzzle.” The broader one: “Computer science gives you the power to change the world … you don’t have physical constraints, only intellectual constraints.”
That worldview has informed how UW teaches in an AI-infused era. The school, he says, encourages facility with new tools while doubling down on fundamentals — problem solving, teamwork and ethics. Debugging, design and verification matter more than ever “because you’re going to have AI generating buggy programs.” And across the university, he argues, every student — not just future AI researchers — needs to be not just literate but fluent in how the technology works and where it fails.
For Seattle, the stakes are generational. The region’s transformation — from Boeing and Physio-Control to platforms, cloud and AI — has brought prosperity and growing pains. But Lazowska believes the path forward is clear: invest “top to bottom, from pre-K through graduate school,” so “our kids are the first-tier beneficiaries of the modern innovation economy we’re creating here.” As he moves into his emeritus role, he has a pragmatic charge to students, educators and policymakers alike: keep building, keep learning and make the machines work for people. If that doesn’t happen, he says, remember the maxim that once featured prominently on his Allen School homepage: “If you’re not part of the steamroller, you’re part of the road.”

The fellowship, named after long-time DNR Fisheries employee Edward Thelen, gives students the opportunity for hands-on research alongside DNR staff and with the University of Iowa’s Iowa Lakeside Laboratory. 
Students in the fellowship, which was funded by private donors, will focus their research on topics like fish population dynamics, invasive species management, water quality monitoring, and watershed health, according to a press release from DNR.

The Iowa Great Lakes include seven water bodies in the Okoboji region, including Big Spirit Lake and both East and West Okoboji lakes. Aquatic and fisheries research will inform conservation strategies for the area and other Midwest lake systems. 
Mary Skopec, the executive director of the Iowa Lakeside Laboratory which is located on West Okoboji Lake, said the partnership with DNR will give “graduate students unparalleled opportunities to conduct impactful research.” 
“It’s an investment not just in science, but in the future health and sustainability of our lakes, rivers, and watersheds,” Skopec said. 
Several lakes in the Iowa Great Lakes system have been listed as impaired by the department due to undesirable pH, turbidity and high levels of certain nutrients. 
Mike Hawkins, DNR’s northwest regional fisheries management supervisor, said the fellowship will attract the “brightest graduate students” to the “unique and valuable ecosystem.” 
“The Iowa Great Lakes are not only a natural treasure for our state but also a living laboratory for understanding aquatic systems,” Hawkins said in the press release. “This program ensures that future scientists will have the resources, mentorship, and access they need to continue protecting these waters for generations to come.”
Interested graduate students can apply by contacting Andrew Carlson, the fisheries biologist at the Spirit Lake Fish Hatchery, at andrew.carlson@dnr.iowa.gov.

Lincoln Hough, R-Springfield, on the first day of the 2024 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate died at 1:42 p.m. Friday afternoon when Republican leaders refused to allow debate on a measure weakening the initiative petition process, GOP state Sen. Lincoln Hough said in an interview with The Independent.
A two-week special session to gerrymander Missouri’s congressional map and make it virtually impossible for voters to amend the state constitution ended Friday when Senate Republicans voted to cut off debate and steamroll both bills across the finish line. 
Hough was one of only two Republicans who opposed every motion to cut off debate and voted against the bills. 
Missouri lawmakers pass gerrymandered congressional map, initiative petition limits

About 20 minutes after the Senate adjourned, Hough said Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin visited his office and removed him as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. Hough has been chairman or vice chairman of the committee since he joined the Senate in 2019.
“She said, ‘​w​e are tired of fighting with you,’” Hough said. ”To which my response was, ‘did you fight with me this week, or did I just go out here and vote no on something that was handed down to the Missouri Senate and a bunch of elected members who are not allowed to talk?’” 
It was the second time Hough has bucked his party this year when it sought to deploy procedural maneuvers to shut down debate. The first came in near the end of the 2025 session in May on bills repealing voter-approved laws expanding sick leave and protecting abortion rights. 
“What I’ve seen at the end of last session, and what I saw this week, is a dismantling of what the Senate is supposed to be,” Hough said.
O’Laughlin did not respond to text messages seeking comment on Hough’s removal as chairman or his description of how it occurred. As of Saturday morning, the change in the committee line-up had not been posted to the Senate website. 
Hough said he is not sure if he is still a member of the committee.
“I’ll be honest with you,” he said. “When the news was delivered to me, I didn’t ask a lot of follow up questions.”
The other Republican who broke with his party on Friday was state Sen Mike Moon of Ash Grove. Reached by text message Saturday, Moon said he had not been told of any changes in his committee assignments. He chairs the Veterans and Military Affairs Committee and the Select Committee on Equal Protection and DEI.
Moon, who has been punished by Senate Republican leadership in the past for some of his actions, declined to comment on the removal of Hough as Appropriations Committee chairman.
Lawmakers were meeting in their second special session of the year to do the bidding of President Donald Trump and gerrymander the 5th Congressional District to unseat U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat. The Senate passed the new map first, shutting off debate after letting Democrats speak against it for about four hours.
Next came the proposal added to the agenda by Kehoe to require both a majority of statewide votes and a majority of the votes in all eight of the state’s congressional districts to pass constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
But along with the motion to take up the measure, state Sen. Brad Hudson, a Republican from Cape Fair, sent the motion to cut off debate before it began.
“My understanding of how this process is supposed to work is, if someone brings a bill before the body, then members are given the opportunity to have a conversation about it,” Hough said. “Maybe, I mean, call me crazy, but maybe even draft amendments and think about ways to improve something or change something.”
Republicans used several unprecedented maneuvers to muscle the two measures to final passage. The steps were orchestrated from the start to get the bills finished by Friday afternoon.
Then-Senate Majority Leader Cindy O’Laughlin of Shelbina speaks in May 2023 after passage of a $51.7 billion state budget as Sen. Lincoln Hough of Springfield waits for his turn to speak (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
When the Senate convened, O’Laughlin presented a new set of rules intended to sidestep every opportunity Democrats could use to stall proceedings.
As a result, no senator was allowed to introduce a bill during the special session, the daily journal was never presented to the body for approval and House-passed legislation became the chamber’s top official priority for the first time in its existence.
The procedural step to shut off debate, called the previous question, is commonly used by the majority in the 163-member Missouri House, where no member can speak for more than 15 minutes on a topic, to move priority legislation.
But until this year, it was a rare move in the Senate, where the rules allow a member to speak as long as they like on any subject once they have the floor. Invoking the rule requires a motion signed by 10 senators.
The previous question has been used to move four bills this year, twice in the regular session and twice in the special session. It was also used to implement the new Senate rules. 
But it had never before been used to pass a bill without any debate at all.
“It’s pretty easy to pass legislation in the Missouri Senate if you don’t have to talk about it, and you can just bring it before the body and say, we’re not, we’re not going to have any discussion whatsoever,” Hough said.
The Republican Party, he said, is suppressing every element that doesn’t walk in lockstep with the Trump White House. 
“It seems that if you have any independent thought, or even just raise a question, you have a problem with this Republican Party,” Hough said. “And that is not the Republican Party that, 15 years ago when I first ran for the House, that I was part of.”
His disagreement with the procedures used to pass the legislation didn’t upset the progress of the bills. Shutting off debate requires 18 votes, and the fewest on any motion was 19.
“This is a dark day in the Missouri Senate,” Hough said. “It is a dark day when policy differences lead to the dismantling of the institution and the removal of individuals from chairmanships.”
In his seven years on the appropriations committee, Hough has shown himself as detail-oriented and able to build consensus while taking a tough negotiating position during final budget talks with the House.
With one more legislative session in his term-limited tenure, Hough won’t have to worry about pleasing leadership.
The upcoming budget could prove to be the most difficult to write in many years. When Kehoe vetoed $300 million in spending items in June, the news release accompanying the action said the state budget office was forecasting a general revenue shortfall of nearly $1 billion in the coming fiscal year.
“We’re definitely,” Hough said, “going to have some conversations about the direction of the state’s finances next year.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/010324_hough1-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-09-14 09:56:16.020144

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune was hot under the collar. It wasn’t just because of the August weather, or the crowd at the Dakotafest agricultural trade show in Mitchell, or the pole barn where the crowd was jammed in. Thune was hot because of the way he’s being treated by Senate Democrats.
Those pesky Democrats have thrown up as many roadblocks as they can to delay the filling of more than 1,300 positions in the Trump administration that require Senate confirmation. “We spend two-thirds of our time on personnel in the United States Senate,” Thune said, according to a Dakota Scout story, calling the resistance from the minority party “unprecedented.”
In a recent op-ed, Thune promised that Senate Republicans are working on a rule change that should hurry the process along.
Thune anticipates ‘big fight’ in September over potential government shutdown

Gone are the days of the Senate gentlemen’s club where the prevailing tradition was that a president should be allowed to have the nominees he wanted. Thune said 90% of President Barack Obama’s nominees were approved by unanimous consent, a fast way to approve nominees that skips committee hearings and floor debate. About 60% of President Joe Biden’s appointees were approved that way. In Trump’s first term, about half of his nominees were approved without hearings or debates.
The downward trend in using unanimous consent is a direct result of the ideological split in this country. To date, none of Trump’s appointees during his second term have been approved by unanimous consent.
The irony here is that Trump can’t get approval for the people he wants to serve in his administration while, during his first months in office, he’s been busy firing or furloughing thousands of federal government employees.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sworn to use every weapon in his arsenal to block the Trump agenda. It looks like that includes slowing the Senate confirmation process to a glacial pace.
Senate Democrats may have acted more favorably toward Trump’s nominees if his Cabinet choices to be the leaders in his government weren’t so astoundingly unqualified. In Trump’s first term, he chose high-ranking officials as if casting a movie. They had to have the right look, but with the right look came a reasonable amount of competence. In Trump 2.0, the need for competence has been discarded. This time out, the prevailing quality to serve in the Trump administration is blind loyalty to the president.
There’s no doubting that the likes of Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are loyal to Trump. Their competence at running the Pentagon, intelligence agencies and the nation’s health care are frequently and rightfully questioned. Life probably wouldn’t be so tough for Thune if he and his Senate Republican colleagues had shown some backbone and told the president that competence had to be the standard for Cabinet secretaries rather than just fawning loyalty to the president.

It’s easy to understand Thune’s frustration. However, he and Senate Republicans brought this on themselves by treating Trump’s Cabinet selections as if they were serious choices rather than a presidential power play to show that he could get anyone he wanted approved by the Senate.
This space has been used before to note that Thune may come to regret, if he doesn’t already, his rise to the top Senate leadership post of his party during a Trump administration. As he complains about the long days he has to put in while fulfilling that role, he should remember that he won the office by claiming that Sen. Tom Daschle was paying too much attention to Senate leadership and not enough attention to South Dakota’s needs.
Senate Democrats may be throwing up roadblocks to Trump’s agenda, but for Republicans this is a self-inflicted wound developed by currying favor with the president rather than doing their jobs. Despite Thune’s complaints, the slow pace of approval for Trump’s nominees is likely what’s best for the country. That’s particularly the case if the nominees Trump seeks to work in his government are anything like the clown car he calls a Cabinet.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/e591A0833-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-14 08:56:29.802477

The Independent swept the “investigative reporting” category, with first place going to Allison Kite for her coverage of Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas’ use of a nonprofit to pay for Chiefs tickets, hotel stays, flights and dinners. Among the revelations in Kite’s reporting, which was based on public records and documents provided by a whistleblower, was that one of the mayor’s trips to the Super Bowl was bankrolled by a politically-connected trade group.
Second place went to Clara Bates for her months-long investigation into the conviction of Kurtis Watkins. Bates revealed that the officer whose testimony led to Watkins’ 25 year sentence had a history of racist social media posts and a mistaken identification of another Black man that led to his death in custody — facts that were not provided to Watkins’ attorneys. 
Third place went to Annelise Hanshaw for a series of stories documenting Republican efforts in Missouri to outlaw gender-affirming care in the state. Among the revelations in her reporting were records showing the attorney general was targeting therapists and social workers across the state who work with transgender minors. 
Bates and Hanshaw shared first place for “best multimedia reporting” for a video accompanying the Kurtis Watkins reporting.

The scooters (about $1,400) can go 30 mph.  The skateboards (about $700) top out at 32 mph).  But following simple instructions on the web, the speed governor can be disabled allowing even faster speeds…up to 60 mph.  That modification is illegal in Connecticut.


Many adults and kids use this new gear responsibly.  Parents love them as it gives their kids mobility (meaning less chauffeuring).  But even at slower speeds these vehicles are dangerous, their riders unprotected in the event of a fall or collision. 
In July a 15-year-old in Trumbull was killed on his e-bike when he was hit by a car.
That’s why new laws are coming in Connecticut October 1 regulating these devices.
If your e-scooter has no pedals (so it’s not a moped) and a motor over 750 watts (allowing speeds over 30 mph), you’ll need a driver’s license. 
E-bikes with motors over 3,500 watts (meaning speeds over 50 mph) must be registered and insured like a motorcycle, and a motorcycle endorsement is required on your license to ride them. 


Unless the scooter is built for two seats, passengers are not allowed.  And e-bikes of all types are not allowed on sidewalks.
It is illegal to operate any motorized vehicle with a seat lower than 26 inches on public roads. That includes many of the smaller scooters and mini-motorbikes that are often marketed toward children.
Everyone on an e-bike or skateboard under the age of 18 must wear a helmet.
E-skateboards are not allowed to drive faster than 20 mph.  Riders must be at least 15 years old but the vehicles do not need to be registered if under that speed limit.  Local laws may be stricter for safety.  Best to ask your Police Department.
If all of these new regulations seem confusing or overly  restrictive, read the recent commentary by State Rep. Tracy Marra which started with the eye-catching headline… “I saw your kid almost die today”.
Increased mobility is great.  But safety must always come first.
If you’re a driver you already know how disconcerting it can be when these e-devices come hurtling along, almost silently and without notice.  But you’re the one driving a ton of steel, so give them their space.
Can law enforcement keep up with all this?  Should they be responsible?
As one First Selectman said the other day:  “It’s not a good thing to have police chasing after 10-, 11- and 12-year olds on bikes and ticketing them.  I’m not anxious to take a police officer away from other enforcement operations.”
What’s the answer, if not enforcement?  Education and parental responsibility.
There’s no way teens can afford these e-bikes on their allowance money.  They’re obviously being purchased by parents, happy to get out of squiring them around from school to dance class to the Y.  Those parents should be responsible for making sure their kids are safe… and legal.
We all love our kids, right?",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Electric_scooters.jpg,,,2025-09-14 07:56:41.156569

It’s no secret that alerts to crime victims in Vermont were full of flaws. This spring, attention from lawmakers put a spotlight on the issue — illuminating that gaps in alerts caused some victims life-altering harm. 
So, lawmakers assembled a task force to make changes to the state notification system called VINE, which stands for Victim Information Notification Everyday. 
Recently, employees at the Department of Corrections quietly made changes to VINE, which they claim will help victims and make the system more trauma-informed. But other task force members think the changes will have the opposite effect — and were left in the dark. 
“I hope that they’re reconsidering it,” said Tim Lueders-Dumont, executive director of the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs. 
Crime victims in Vermont have the legal right to get timely notifications about the movement of those charged with or convicted of harming them. Once someone is behind bars, they’re entered into VINE. And victims can sign up to get VINE alerts on someone’s custody status or whereabouts via call, text or email. 
Although victim advocates in Lueders-Dumont’s department interact with the system regularly, he had no input in the changes to the platform and wasn’t formally notified until after they went into effect. 
That’s because VINE is paid for and managed by the Department of Corrections, which runs the state’s six prisons. The department’s victim specialists, along with state’s attorneys’ advocates, rely on the automated system to notify victims because they typically juggle very high case loads. 
But Vermonters have suffered because of high-stakes errors in the VINE system. 
Sometimes faulty alerts told victims that an offender was being released when they were actually being transferred to a different prison. Other times, an offender was released from prison with no notice to the victim until days later. That perpetrator sometimes came back and harmed the victim again, due to the delayed alert. 
Many victims also resent the automated nature of the notifications — with phone calls containing potentially triggering information coming from a cold, robotic voice. 
In the past, victims would get an alert if their offender was transferred from one prison to another, or if they were going to appear in court in person. 
But this summer, the Department of Corrections decided it would no longer notify victims in those circumstances. The department didn’t consult with Lueders-Dumont about the changes or let him know upfront that it was changing the system, he said. 
Jenn Poehlmann, executive director for the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services and chair of the task force, has long advocated for making the notifications customizable, so each victim can decide what types of info they want to receive. 
“The point was that this task force was going to increase options and choice for victims,” she said. Eliminating more of the platform’s services only decreases those options, she said.
Poehlmann called it “concerning” that everyone else was left in the dark. Lueders-Dumont said he wishes he was clued in earlier, so that his advocates could be aware — and make victims aware — of the change in services. 
The department justified its decision in a later memo, per Lueders-Dumont’s request. 
Jon Murad, interim commissioner of the department, explained the VINE services scratched by his department “often led to unnecessary confusion, distress, or retraumatization.” 
The notifications were “doing more harm than good,” said Ashley Fisk, a corrections Senior Victim Services Specialist, in an interview with VTDigger. “(Victims) would call us immediately and want to know specifics that we didn’t have,” she said. 
But other members on the task force disagree. 
Lueders-Dumont said his advocates are opposed to the change. “It’s not representative of the conversations we’ve had with victims,” he said. 
Victims who enrolled for VINE were told they would get the alerts that have now been discontinued, Lueders-Dumont said. Victims want to receive those updates and should be able to get them, he said. 
If a victim lives in the same town as a prison, they may not want their perpetrator living close by, he said. And he’s seen cases where victims have wanted the comfort of distance, he said. 
In turn, Cassidy Renfrew, field operations manager for the department, said that victims who have that concern could use the department’s publicly accessible offender locator online to see where someone’s imprisoned. 
Lueders-Dumont and Poehlmann also take issue with ending alerts that notify victims when an alleged offender is taken to court.
Many victims base their decision to appear in court on whether their offender will be present, Lueders-Dumont said. Crime suspects who are held in prison can tune into hearings virtually via WebEx. VINE offered a way for victims to find out ahead of time if their offender is appearing in-person in court, he said. 
There’s already been at least one instance in which a victim went to court and was surprised to see their offender in the room, Poehlmann said. 
“That should never happen,” she said. 
Renfrew argued that even without the VINE notification, victims could find out if an alleged offender is appearing in-person or virtually because the court typically decides ahead of time whether an alleged offender will appear in-person, she said. 
In the future, Lueders-Dumont hopes he finds out about any future changes ahead of time, even if he disagrees with them. “I request a formal notification so that I can distribute that information to our whole field so they’re at least not surprised,” he said. 
Lueders-Dumont asked the Corrections Department to send formal memos about any future changes. He, Poehlmann and the Corrections Department are working on a formal memorandum of understanding to keep everyone on the same page. 
True collaboration means transparency and better communication, Poehlmann said. 
“That’s what the Legislature wanted us to do for victims and survivors, and that’s what we need to do,” she said.

Why does Vermont keep choosing an all-payer approach to health care reform, as if bringing in — and regulating — the payers will be the solution?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Miriam Tatum: The current approach to health care reform isn’t working for Vermonters.","This commentary is by Miriam Tatum, of Derby. Tatum is a retired pediatrician in primary care and community hospital care for 30 years in Newport and Derby Line. She is an ally of the Vermont Worker Center.


Almost a year ago, Newport and Northeast Kingdom residents first heard that a consultant to the Green Mountain Care Board recommended converting North Country Hospital’s inpatient, emergency room and surgical services to primary care offices and an urgent care clinic. 
Fortunately, hospital leaders and concerned citizens spoke up immediately to correct the consultant’s data and to remind the Green Mountain Care Board that without a fully staffed emergency room in Newport, a resident from the Northeast Kingdom could face a one- to three-hour ambulance ride to lifesaving care. 
The hospital board rejected the consultant’s recommendation and took quick action to decrease administrative costs, improve billing services, protect recruitment and retention, and begin collaboration with St. Johnsbury’s community hospital for needed specialty care. As reported recently, the hospital’s budget for 2026 leaves inpatient, surgical and emergency room services intact, and has been approved by the Green Mountain Care Board as submitted.
Meanwhile, statewide efforts at health care payment reform, launched in 2017 as the all-payer model have not met their target goal of containing health care costs while improving population health. 
OneCare Vermont, the accountable care organization that administered the all-payer model, will shut down at the end of 2025, and Vermont plans to sign on to a new program named the All Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, with a timeline of 2026 to 2037. It would be supported with funds from Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance companies. Oversight of payers and hospitals by the Green Mountain Care Board and the Vermont Legislature is expected to continue. 
Will this second version of payment reform be any more successful than the first? 
Hopefully it won’t be challenged by another pandemic with the shutdown of hospitals. But it will face funding cuts (no more premium subsidies on Vermont Health Connect) that leave more Vermonters uninsured and inevitably shift the burden of care to hospitals. 
Future funding cuts scheduled for 2027 will threaten successful Vermont programs like Dr. Dynasaur, Blueprint for Health, the Vermont Department of Health with community health workers, Support and Services at Home, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
It will be difficult to improve population health in our community without these proven cost-effective services. 
Why does Vermont keep choosing an all-payer approach to health care reform, as if bringing in — and regulating — the payers will be the solution? 
Perhaps it’s time to boldly shift our focus to insuring all people with universal health care that is state-administered and privately delivered. We are already on that path, which Vermont legislation passed in 2011 to create a single-payer system (though it was never implemented), and with Vermont hospitals already accustomed to operating on pooled funds from Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurances. 
If we’re told the single-payer model is too expensive or won’t work, let’s remember that the current system doesn’t work and costs too much — not just in dollars, but in our own health and our communities’ health.

This story by Tim Calabro was first published in The Herald on Sept. 11, 2025.
Phill Gatenby rolled over the Moxley Bridge in Chelsea with a plastic skeleton riding shotgun in his Jeep, having made the long drive from Brattleboro for an early morning visit. Just a year ago, the Manchester, England native — by way of Florida — had never laid eyes on a covered bridge. Now he’s smitten.
Gatenby recalled seeing a covered bridge while driving around and thinking, “Oh, that’s interesting. I’d never seen a covered bridge in my life before. Never really heard of them,” he said. “A couple days later, I was going to Townshend, and all of a sudden it’s the Dummerston Bridge, and I’m just like, different size, different shape, different color.”
He stopped for directions and as he got lost on the back roads, he saw more and more covered bridges.
What started as casual curiosity has evolved into a quest: visit and film all 100 of Vermont’s authentic, historic covered bridges and share the journey on YouTube in a series titled “Vermont’s 100 Covered Bridges.”
So far he’s been to 50 and cranked out 37 videos of his visits — one every Sunday.
The most recent set of episodes has focused on the covered bridges of Tunbridge, Chelsea, and Randolph.
No two are quite alike. From king and queen trusses to parallelogram-shaped spans built on bends, like some on the First Branch, Gatenby has come to appreciate their variety and character.
And, stepping back from the bridges, the entire scene fascinates Gatenby.
“I mentioned this in the Kingsbury Bridge [episode]. I was at the bridge and I looked, and you’ve got the green mountains in the background and rolling hills. Then you’ve got the farm with the — is it the corn towers? —  the river and a covered bridge. And it just says, like, you can’t get more Vermont!”
Gatenby’s process is rigorous. Each episode takes hours to shoot and edit. He gets different angles — sometimes driving through a bridge three or four times for the right shot. He’s waded into rivers, climbed steep banks, and once filmed inside a long-retired bridge that had been turned into a town shed.
“I try and do something that’s consistent,” he says. “So it’s, you know, the same start, the same middle. I go in the river. I’ve been in every single river so far.”
Gatenby credits community access TV stations — first Okemo Valley TV in Ludlow and now Brattleboro Community TV — for helping him build his skills and loaning him equipment.
“They literally brilliantly sat down and five, six, seven weeks went through how you do it,” he recalled.
Gatenby’s episodes go out via Okemo Valley TV’s YouTube channel and have regular times on the Okemo Valley and Brattleboro TV stations.
Form, Function, History
Vermont once had more than 600 covered bridges, Gatenby noted, but flooding and age have winnowed down the number greatly. Now, 100 remain and many towns hold clusters of them.
Tunbridge, for example, boasts five (Flint, Larkin, Mill, Cilley and Howe), with the Moxley bridge just over the Chelsea line. Randolph has three (Kingsbury, Gifford, and Braley or Johnson), all of them along the Second Branch.
Gatenby pointed out that three of the First Branch bridges were built by the same person, Arthur Adams. That’s a phenomenon common to covered bridges, Gatenby noted. Oftentimes the same person who had the skills to build a bridge would become the area’s go-to expert.
As Gatenby visits each of the 100 covered bridges spread throughout the state, he points out the history and construction techniques used in each, particularly the suspension methods unique to covered bridges. Most covered bridges in the White River Valley make use of modified king trusses, posts fitted into a triangle, which provide strength to the structure. Some, like the Moxley bridge, use both king trusses and square queen trusses around them.
Vermont’s covered bridges aren’t just structural relics, though — they’re cultural icons.
Some have graced the silver screen, including the Kingsbury Bridge in Randolph, used by Alfred Hitchcock as scenery in his 1955 film “The Trouble with Harry.”
“North by Northwest” has its dramatic crop duster strafing Cary Grant, Gatenby jokes in one of his episodes before cutting to a humble, scenic shot featuring the South Randolph bridge. “Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite as glamorous as that!”
The Chiselville bridge in Sunderland — Gatenby’s favorite so far — featured in “Baby Boom,” Diane Keaton’s 1987 film, and a year later, in the 1988 Chevy Chase and Madolyun Smith Osborne comedy, the Upper Falls bridge in Weathersfield made for a memorable gag (“I wouldn’t go that way if I were you”).
Another memorable stop is East Corinth, where the prop bridge used in “Beetlejuice” was fabricated out of whole cloth for the two weeks of filming. “Thousands of people go there every year,” he said, noting that the set-piece, used now as a shed at a ski area, doesn’t count among the authentic and historic bridges he films.
Nor, he said, does the Quechee Bridge. Though it is often mistaken for a traditional covered bridge, it’s just a facade.
“It’s concrete and steel. There’s very little wood,” Gatenby said. “You see the wood on the outside and the roof.”
Traditional bridges are completely made from wood and use a variety of truss systems to strengthen the span.
Place and Purpose
Gatenby moved to Vermont from Florida in July of last year. He now lives in Brattleboro with his wife and works as a shift supervisor at a home for adults with mental health issues.
“I’m a trained youth worker in England,” he said, having spent years working for the Prince’s Trust, a charity founded by King Charles. His day job might be demanding, but the early hours leave room for exploration.
“Three o’clock to 11:30 at night, so the daytime allows me to spend time in the TV studio,” he says. That flexibility has enabled him to squeeze in long road trips, sometimes filming six or seven bridges in a single day. “I’ve got to do minimum six, seven bridges each trip now,” he added. “To make it worth it.”
This Sunday, the show’s 38th episode will be released.
“I’m doing a little special 50th episode,” he said, noting the halfway point in the 100-bridge journey. “That’s where I’m bringing in stuff like the Quechee bridge. Because people said, ‘Oh, you didn’t go to the Quechee.’”
As the series nears its midpoint, Gatenby’s audience is slowly growing, both online and in the communities he visits.
“It’s just amazing … you know, and I’m just visiting them all,” he said, “places that I wouldn’t have got to see otherwise.”
With 50 more bridges to go, Vermont’s covered bridge guy still has miles to travel and stories to uncover.Gatenby’s series of covered bridge videos can be watched on Okemo Valley and Brattleboro public television stations or found on YouTube.

In its life at Shelburne Museum, the Ticonderoga will be repaired and replaced in parts. It will be preserved in spirit even as many of the original materials waste away.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in the Shelburne News on Sept. 11, 2025.
It was a novel thing in 1955 to move a steamboat across the land. It’s still inexplicable: deciding to sink an 892-ton boat down onto railroad freight cars in the dead of winter, hauling custom-built tracks from behind the boat up to the front as it inched across the landscape, all to make it part of a museum.
Electra Havermeyer Webb, the founder of Shelburne Museum, was big on novel ideas. Before the Ticonderoga, she already had at least eight structures moved onto the museum grounds, including a 19th century lighthouse from Colchester and a historic jail from across the state in Castleton.
It took a little over two months to move the boat, which had been chugging around Lake Champlain since it was built in 1906 at the Shelburne shipyard. It never moved more than 250 feet in a day.
“I think she instilled a lot of pride in the people that worked around her and in the endeavor of what was going on here, what she was creating. I think most of the workmen around building the museum had a great fondness and respect for her, and it takes a special leader to be able to do that,” Chip Stulen, the museum’s director of preservation, said.

Stulen has been in charge of breathing life into the Ticonderoga for almost half the time that it’s been on land. In 1993 when he was first hired, he said the boat had fallen into disrepair, although maybe not in a way that was always obvious to visitors.
“You could open up a room and you could see moss growing on the carpet, and not only that moss on the carpet, but you had ferns growing out of it,” Stulen said.
When the boat had been on water, he noted, it had an entire crew looking after it. But then, once it was a part of the museum, it had to compete with all the other structures that needed care. The project of making sure a boat, never meant to stand forever in the grass, stayed sea-worthy fell behind.
Some of the work that had been done previously had even caused further issues. Stulen said some of the patch jobs to leaks ended up causing even more condensation — when he started, guides were moving an estimated 30 buckets around the boat to catch the drips.
In the mid-1990s, the museum undertook a massive restoration of the Ticonderoga, with Stulen steering the ship (pun intended).
“We were basically taking the boat apart and then putting it back together again. So, we were opening up areas on the Ti that nobody had seen before, except for the workmen that put it together,” Stulen said.
When Havermeyer Webb had the Ticonderoga moved to the museum, it hadn’t come with a blueprint — no index of materials or list of manufacturers.
According to Stulen, preserving the ship has sometimes meant finding inventive ways to mimic its original design.
For example, a significant portion of the interior flooring of the boat is made of rubber puzzle piece-shaped tiles, their red tabs pressed seamlessly together. In contemporary times, the tiles are not just unique, they’re essentially obsolete.

Stulen had to find a company in California that would make them to order. Luckily, the museum ended up with a surplus. The tiles cover the grand staircase and the landing beneath. However, someday, the surplus will run out again.
Preservation is a continual process.
As Stulen sat on the deck of the Ti last week in one of the caned chairs lined up for visitors, a worker nearby braided in a new piece of the diamond-patterned roping that acts as a deck fence and, at one point, carried away one of the many wooden pillars holding up the ceiling for repair.
Even parts of the pillars have needed to be replaced. Stulen has worked to find similar wood, sometimes needing to repair the repairs.
“I’m continually amazed by the old growth material that was on the Ti where the grain is so tight that it has longevity to it,” Stulen said. “And even five years later, we were coming back, having to repair that.”
In its life at Shelburne Museum, the Ticonderoga will be repaired and replaced in parts. It will be preserved in spirit even as many of the original materials waste away. Preservation is about staying as close as possible to the original, but in preserving shape and material and style, Stulen is also preserving stories.
Stories of passengers crisscrossing the lake, of the advent of motor vehicles climbing ramps to board and at least one story of a very cramped elephant seeking passage.
“It’s under my skin,” Stulen said. “I remember early on, I’d stand up on the upper deck by the walking beam, and because you could see the lake at that time from there, you just sort of stood there and kind of imagined the boat moving a little bit.”
The Shelburne Museum will be holding events September 11-14 to celebrate 70 years of the Ticonderoga.

“I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, ‘If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is,’” Kurt Vonnegut entreated us. It’s easy enough to find humor and magic in silver linings as a kid; less so, as we begin reading the news and paying bills. But “silliness-in-spite-of” is a quality this week’s poet, Gretchen Wertlieb of South Burlington, might argue is essential for our wellbeing, and for a life well-lived – might even, by one definition, be translated as “resilience.”

Ode to the simply whimsical and the unnecessarily dramatic
Gretchen Wertlieb, 17, South Burlington
Ode to those who make life into gold,
who bring us some sparkle as we grow old.
Ode to the places, friends, and small things,
for which credit is unequal to the joy that they bring.

Uproariously laughing in a too-quiet room,
or dancing a tango with the red kitchen broom.
The rush of arriving in the nick of time
to catch what is gone in the blink of an eye.

Ode to the fails, the crashes, the burns,
and ode to whomever they might concern.
Ode to friends, old and new, who you’ll never let go,
ode to kindness to all, even ones you don’t know. 

Ode to novels, and stories, and handwritten verses,
long, run-on titles and believing in curses.
Ode to the feelings of heartache and loss,
ode to humanity, with all its faults.

“Cheers!” to the drama, the flair, the hurrahs,
the fainting couches, glitter, and decorative bras.
To all the outrageous, exciting, and new,
and to far too much confidence in the things that you do.

The quest of life viewed with a pair of fresh eyes
brings ambition to act and take to the skies.
Ode to the rhyme, the rhythm, the beat,
for wherever you go, that’s all you will need.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-14 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Rising costs of exchange health insurance could be major issue in 2026 U.S. Senate election,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/14/rising-costs-of-exchange-health-insurance-could-be-major-issue-in-2026-u-s-senate-election/,The rising costs of health insurance on the ACA exchange could be issue in 2026 Senate election between Democrat Scott Colom and  incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith.,"The expected rising costs for health insurance could give Democratic candidate Scott Colom a line of attack in next year’s election against incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith.
It is an issue that will hit tens of thousands of Mississippians right dab in their faces and in their pocketbooks when they go to renew their health insurance policies later this year and see how much their monthly premiums have increased.
Colom, a longtime district attorney from Columbus, can hammer Hyde-Smith for the rising costs. After all, the rising costs could be traced directly to Hyde-Smith and her allies if the Republican-led U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump do not act to prevent the increase in health insurance premium costs for about 285,000 Mississippians who purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act exchange or marketplace.
Unless Congress acts before the end of the year, the price of the marketplace’s health insurance policies will increase an estimated $480 annually in Mississippi, according to KFF, a national group that conducts health care research. And based on other factors, such as inflation, the increase could be significantly more.
While the enhanced federal assistance helps primarily lower income people or the working poor, the end of the enhanced federal assistance also could mean more affluent Mississippians who depend on the marketplace policies would no longer be eligible for any federal help.
During the administration of former President Joe Biden, lawmakers passed legislation to enhance the federal aid provided to people who purchase insurance through the ACA marketplace. Lower income people already received some help with the cost of the marketplace policies as an important part of the Affordable Care Act, but the Biden-era legislation increased the amount of help. And under the Biden legislation, wealthier people would be eligible for federal assistance if their health insurance costs more than 8.5% of their total earnings.
Hyde-Smith, like other members of the Mississippi congressional delegation, voted against the enhanced federal assistance for the marketplace policies.
In the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill passed earlier this year, Trump and the Republican Congress were careful to ensure that the cuts to Medicaid and other programs would not go into effect until after the 2026 midterm election, when Colom is challenging Hyde-Smith.
But Congress did not take any action in the One Big Beautiful Bill to ensure that the enhanced federal marketplace assistance did not end before the 2026 elections, leaving rising health care costs as an issue for Colom and others.
Mississippi will be hit particularly hard by the end of the federal aid for the cost of marketplace policies.
Participation in the marketplace by Mississippians has increased 242% in recent years since the enhanced federal assistance program was enacted, according to KFF. Only Texas has seen a greater increase at 255%.
Unsurprisingly, the states where the participation has increased the most are all red states that in most cases have not expanded Medicaid to provide health insurance for primarily the working poor, with the federal government paying the bulk of the costs. In states where there is no Medicaid expansion, data shows that the working poor flocked to the exchange to garner health insurance.
It should be pointed out that the end of the enhanced federal assistance for marketplace policies will hurt not just those having to pay the higher premiums for the marketplace policies, but the state of Mississippi as a whole. Hospitals and other medical providers, already struggling, will be forced to provide more uncompensated care or pass those costs on to other Mississippians who do have health insurance.
Despite those health care issues, Hyde-Smith will be a heavy favorite to win reelection in Mississippi, where a Democrat has not won a U.S. Senate election since 1982.
But if Colom can connect rising health insurance costs to Hyde-Smith, that could be a powerful issue.
Of course, Hyde-Smith and the Republican Congress have until the end of the year to act and prevent people from having to pay more for marketplace plans.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28164737/3X0A6641.jpg,,,2025-09-14 07:56:41.156569

Kennedy Jr. after Kennedy's confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, 2025. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)As a licensed clinical social worker, a grassroots community organizer and public health advocate in Northeast Louisiana, I eagerly anticipated hearing U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy’s timely insights at a recent event in West Monroe. However, as a concerned voter and mother of two young children, I was not only left with my fears unassuaged, but also a spirit deeply unsettled for our nation’s health and the future my children will inherit.
Cassidy cast the deciding vote to confirm U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy after he promised to uphold vaccine confidence and scientific integrity. He has since broken those commitments, spreading misinformation, undermining public health and endangering lives.
During Cassidy’s visit in West Monroe, I asked him pointedly: “Aside from removing RFK Jr. as HHS Secretary and confirming a more competent appointee, how do you plan to protect Americans’ access to vaccines, especially for our most vulnerable babies aged 0-3 years old?”
I appreciated his initial robust response, likening fighting vaccine-preventable disease to “biological warfare.” Cassidy also said he was upset with the termination of mRNA research. It was evident how passionately he feels about protecting access to lifesaving vaccines.
However, everything fell flat with his non sequitur closing statement
“I don’t know, but I’m working on it,” the senator said.
I’m here to say: we do know, and we have coalitions across the nation who are also “working on it.” Here are a few simple ways we can stand up to the deadly disinformation sweeping our nation.
First, there is an alternative to RFK Jr.’s radical and scientifically unsound “Make America Healthy Again” agenda.
Defending Public Health has put out a report titled “Improving the Health of Americans Together.” The all-volunteer network of doctors, health care professionals, and public health advocates — not incentivized by pharmaceutical or special interest influences – promotes “an evidence-based framework for addressing the root causes of illness in the U.S.”
Thankfully, many courageous patriots are already rising to the occasion. I’m reminded of Mordecai’s words in Esther 4:14: “if you keep quiet at a time like this, deliverance and relief … will arise from some other place, but you and your relatives will die. Who knows if perhaps you were made queen for just such a time as this?”
Today’s “some other place” is the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy’s Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota. This initiative is a direct and credible response to Secretary Kenndy’s dismantling of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee, with the goal of “safeguarding vaccine use in the U.S. so that it remains grounded in the best available science, free from external influence, and focused on optimizing protection of individuals, families, and communities against vaccine-preventable diseases.”
Senator Cassidy, history will remember whether you protected the health of our people or stood silent as Americans suffered. I urge you to consider whether RFK Jr.’s continued leadership is consistent with the oath he took, as well as your oath as a physician to do no harm — and to stand on the side of truth, health and life.
I am doing all I can to give my children the future they deserve. Let’s “work on it” together.

(Photo by Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)U.S. Food and Drug Administration leaders under President Donald Trump are moving to abandon a decades-old policy of asking outside experts to review drug applications, a move critics say would shield the agency’s decisions from public scrutiny.
The agency “would like to get away” from assembling panels of experts to examine and vote on individual drugs, because “I don’t think they’re needed,” said George Tidmarsh, head of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. He relayed the message Tuesday at a meeting of health care product makers and Wednesday to an FDA advocacy group.
In addition to being redundant, Tidmarsh said, advisory meetings on specific drugs were “a tremendous amount of work for the company and for the FDA. We want to use that work and our time to focus on the big questions.”
The FDA’s advisory committees were created in their current form by a 1972 law aimed at expanding and regulating the government’s use of experts in technical decisions. They’re periodically summoned for advice, including to review evidence and vote on whether the FDA should approve drugs, vaccines, and medical devices, often when FDA officials face a difficult decision.
FDA actions have traditionally aligned with committee votes. A departure can provoke controversy and public debate, as was the case with the split 2021 decision on whether to approve the Biogen drug Aduhelm to treat Alzheimer’s disease.
The FDA approved the drug despite a “no” vote from its advisory committee, whose members felt the medicine did little to treat the disease. The conflict over Aduhelm laid bare the FDA’s struggle to reconcile pressure from industry and desperate patients with its rigorous evaluation of drug risks and benefits.

Tidmarsh said the committees would still be consulted on general issues like how to regulate different classes of drugs. But meetings on specific drugs, in which experts plow through piles of studies and hours of testimony from FDA and company officials, were mainly useful, he said, because they allowed the public to see how the FDA worked.
This month the FDA began publishing the “complete response letters” it sends to companies when it declines to approve their products. Releasing the letters, which previously required filing requests under the federal Freedom of Information Act, promotes a level of transparency akin to the advisory meetings’, Tidmarsh said.
Advisory committee meetings on individual drugs “are redundant when you have the complete review letters,” he told KFF Health News in a brief interview after appearing at the health care products conference.
Former FDA officials and academics who study the agency disagree. The meetings help FDA scientists make decisions and increase public understanding of drug regulation, and abandoning them doesn’t make sense, they said.
Tidmarsh’s reasoning is “hard to follow,” former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told KFF Health News. “It’s extremely useful for people inside FDA to find out what other experts think before they make their final decisions. And it’s important to do that in a way that enables the public to understand the points of view.”
“Experts might ask questions of the company or FDA that neither of them thought of on their own,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, an associate professor of bioethics and law at the University of Pennsylvania. “The public has few other opportunities to comment about FDA decisions.”
Spokespeople for FDA and the Health and Human Services Department did not respond to repeated requests for elaboration on Tidmarsh’s comments.
Louisiana has not monitored public funds given to anti-abortion pregnancy centers

Califf at times disagreed with advisory committees as commissioner of the agency and once floated the idea that it might be better if they deliberated but did not vote on products. Still, while “maybe someone can come up with a better one, I always thought it was an amazing system,” he said.
The FDA is not obliged to ask the outside experts to review drugs and usually hasn’t. It calls on them mainly for important new types of medications or when a decision is especially tricky because of high demand for a product that may have limited value, Aduhelm being a classic example.
The advisory committees are “an important resource” for the FDA, said Sarah Ryan, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. “They can play an important part of the rigorous human drug review process we have in the U.S.”
The committees are often asked to help settle disagreements within the FDA about how to move forward on a regulatory decision, said Reshma Ramachandran, a health services researcher and clinician at the Yale School of Medicine.
She and other researchers and former FDA officials praised FDA Commissioner Marty Makary’s decision to publish the complete response letters.
But the letters don’t obviate the need for committee meetings, said Peter Lurie, a former associate FDA commissioner who heads the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
“A disclosed complete response letter tells the public that a company’s application was rejected and why,” Lurie said. “An advisory committee meeting says to outside experts and the public, ‘Here’s what we’re thinking of doing and we’d love your input before we decide.’ Plainly, those are not equivalent.”
The changes Tidmarsh described are already playing out on the ground. The FDA has held only seven advisory committee meetings since Trump reentered the White House, compared with 22 over the same time frame last year. Officials say they will now release complete response letters as they are sent, and published a batch of 89 earlier in September.
Makary has to some extent replaced the advisory committees, whose members have traditionally been vetted for expertise and biases and which are required to deliberate in public, with panels of handpicked scientists who support his views on subjects such as hormone replacement therapy and antidepressants.
Diana Zuckerman, a critic of the drug industry, attended the July hormone replacement therapy panel that considered the FDA’s black-box warning listing dangers of the treatment. Makary had wanted the warning removed and packed the panel with like-minded experts.
The event was hastily called with no opportunity for the public to review discussion materials or comment on them, she said.
“All that was transparent was that they didn’t want to hear from anyone who disagreed with them,” said Zuckerman, who leads the National Center for Health Research.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Before becoming commissioner, Makary pushed for more advisory committee meetings. In early 2022, he blasted the FDA’s decision to approve covid boosters for children ages 12 to 15 without consulting its Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Makary posted on the social platform X at the time, “It is a slap in the face to science for @US_FDA to circumvent the standard convening of the expert advisory board.”
But Tidmarsh seems to disagree.
Instead of asking an advisory committee to vote in favor of or against a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, for example, he said the FDA would be better served by a committee studying the best way to evaluate such drugs, such as which outcomes, or end points, to measure. “Is this end point correct for Duchenne muscular dystrophy? That’s an important question that cuts across many different companies,” he told KFF Health News.
FDA official Vinay Prasad canceled a planned July advisory committee meeting to discuss a Duchenne drug made by the biotech company Capricor Therapeutics. The FDA later published its rejection, or “complete response letter,” to Capricor, which then published its own letter of response to the FDA. Prasad was later pushed out and rehired with fewer powers.
An advisory committee meeting could have worked through the drug’s risks and benefits in a calmer, public, less politicized atmosphere, Ramachandran said.
The FDA usually agrees with the votes of its several dozen advisory committees. A 2023 study found that the FDA agreed with 97% of “yes” votes and 67% of “no” votes.
That’s why Tidmarsh’s comments “come as a complete surprise,” said Genevieve Kanter, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, who wrote commentary accompanying the study. The FDA has postponed a lot of meetings this year, but “everyone thought it was temporary, with the transition and all the firings.”
“Another theory is that this decision is strategic,” she said, “in terms of consolidating power in the agencies so that you are no longer accountable to outside experts or the public.”
We’d like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what’s happening within the federal health bureaucracy.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) WEST FARGO, N.D. — North Dakota soybean growers rely heavily on exports to China, but with harvest on the horizon, those exports are nowhere in sight. 
“China hasn’t made a single purchase commitment,” John Newton, a longtime ag economist and executive head of Terrain, a farm credit services company, said last week at the Big Iron farm show. “We need to start seeing those commitments come in right now. And I think that’s really what’s weighing on the farm economy.” 
Newton said export commitments for the crop of soybeans that is about to be harvested are at the lowest point since 2018-19, which is keeping prices low. 
Newton, who was previously the Republican chief economist for the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, said he thinks the Trump administration tariff policies have worked to the extent that there have been deals with the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other countries. “But where we haven’t seen anything yet, is with China, and where that hits hard is with soybeans,” Newton said. 
The North Dakota Soybean Council hosted a trade delegation from China in August despite the trade dispute between the two countries.

“I think it’s important to note the fact that the lines of communication are open with the buying and the selling,” German said while representing the association at Big Iron last week. “We’ve just got to get the politics out of it.” 
Farmer Mark Knutson of Fargo was part of the Chinese delegation’s tour of a North Dakota farm and grain elevator. 
“They want to do business with us, but we’re just more expensive than the Brazilian soybean right now,” Knutson said. 
Newton said it is unclear how long the Chinese can rely on Brazil to be its main source of soybeans, which it uses to feed hogs. 
He said China had built up its soybean supplies before President Donald Trump took office.
“It is feasible to think that they can get everything they need by drawing down their stocks and then purchasing from Brazil,” Newton said. “They can’t do that very long, maybe just for this crop season.” 
But China also is good at playing the long game, he said, with the Communist regime not facing the same political forces that are at play in the United States. 
“So their strategy can be a little bit different than what our strategy is here at home,” Newton said. 
Newton said negotiations may be affected by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling after it hears arguments in November on the legality of Trump’s tariff policies. 
If tariffs are ruled illegal, “it takes a lot of the leverage off the table” for the Trump administration, Newton said.

German said that China sitting out of the U.S. market is creating other changes in the soybean market. Southeast Asian countries that may have purchased from Brazil are  buying some U.S. soybeans, he said.
“Unfortunately, a lot of that product is going to be shipped out of the Gulf or the East Coast, so producers in North Dakota might not reap any benefits of it,” German said. 
North Dakota soybeans destined for Asia go through the Pacific Northwest. 
North Dakota farmers are also being affected by storms that obliterated storage bins on farms and elevators, giving some farmers little option but to take low cash prices at harvest instead of waiting for a market rebound. 
There are a couple of good signs for farmers. Newton said corn export commitments are strong and beef prices are at record highs.

The development of soybean crush plants in the region, which can take delivery of soybeans year-round, also helps make that possible. 
North Dakota saw two soybean crush plants open last year at Jamestown and Casselton. South Dakota has added crush plants, too. 
German said they are helping keep poor soybean prices from being even worse.
“They’re a godsend right now,” German said. 
In Trump’s first term, a trade dispute with China led to the federal government paying out $23 billion in relief to farmers who suffered a loss of trade because of lost exports.  
Newton said there is again talk of a similar economic “bridge” for farmers but again with many factors at play. 
Newton said some in Congress see the $66 billion targeted to farmers over the next decade in the so-called “one big, beautiful bill” as giving the ag industry the help it needs. But he said many of the benefits included in the bill, such as improvement to crop insurance and other programs, won’t show up for many farmers until next harvest. 
He said some in Congress don’t understand that those potential payoffs “are a long way away.” 
Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., chairs the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee. He said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor that he is working with Sen. John Boozman, R-Mont., chair of the Agriculture Committee, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and the Agriculture Department “to find ways to support our producers while the Trump administration works to put in place better long-term trade agreements.”

“I wish I could say that stress and burnout has started to decline, but burnout continues to be high among doctors, nurses, and allied health staff working in all of our clinical settings, ranging from emergency departments and ICUs to our outpatient clinics and services. I am hopeful that one of the silver linings of COVID is an increasing focus on the men[...]","When COVID arrived, in March of 2020, Dr. Paul Hattis and Dr. Jarone Lee, a critical care and emergency medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, started a series for CommonWealth Beacon of what came to be more than a dozen interviews during the initial years of the pandemic. (You can read more here.) It has been about two and half years since their last Q&A posting. Hattis, a former professor at Tufts University Medical School and currently a fellow at the Lown Institute, decided to have a check-in discussion with Lee to see what his world is like these days and what sort of longer lasting impact Covid has had on it. This conversation has been edited for clarity. 
HATTIS: What has happened to inpatient volumes, including ICU volumes since the Covid era peak? 
LEE: Overall, at MGB [Mass General Brigham], ever since COVID arrived, our emergency department, inpatient, and ICU units continue to run persistently high volumes, both at our academic centers and community hospitals. Previously, on the ICU side, high volume months were often more predictable, with summer bringing higher numbers of trauma patients, and wintertime often with higher respiratory virus cases. However, these days, we continuously have a high volume of high-acuity patients year-round.  I think a key contributing factor is that many of the smaller hospitals have less staffed beds and reduced ability to care for very sick patients.  
I do believe this is worse since the pandemic, and the accompanying era of rising health care supply and labor costs, nursing shortages, and difficulty keeping needed subspecialists on staff. For example, at many hospitals, if a patient arrives at a hospital without a neurosurgeon and has a head injury with blood around the brain, they will need to transfer to a system like ours.  
HATTIS: What would you say has happened with stress and burnout in the last couple of years? Is it better than things were during the height of Covid? 
LEE: I wish I could say that stress and burnout has started to decline, but burnout continues to be high among doctors, nurses, and allied health staff working in all of our clinical settings, ranging from emergency departments and ICUs to our outpatient clinics and services. I am hopeful that one of the silver linings of COVID is an increasing focus on the mental health of health care workers. I do feel like there has been a more concerted effort to figure out how to make things better – despite knowing that there is a need for a wide variety of strategies to address the problem. 
Another good sign is that I recently encountered a new starting group of residents in the ICU who were not yet exposed to intense Covid care situations during their clinical training years. Why I bring this up is that they were all extremely energetic, engaged in learning about medicine [and] the hospital, and in exploring what happened during the initial years of the Covid era. I am excited to follow their journeys, and I believe their high energy and interest will continue to help with the overall environment. 
HATTIS: Of course, people still get Covid infections today and get hospitalized. Some are very ill. Do survival rates of ICU patients with Covid seem any different now than when you had many cases? 
LEE: People continue to get Covid, and we continue to have patients that get admitted to the hospital and the ICU with COVID-related complications, including respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. As a medical community, we learned a ton about how to treat not only Covid, but diseases like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which you can get from COVID. Similarly, we learned an incredible amount about how to use advanced, non-invasive oxygenation devices, such as high-flow nasal cannulas, safely and effectively to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. COVID continues to have lingering effects, including many patients with long COVID, who continue to suffer a wide variety of symptoms.  
HATTIS: Do you have any specific concerns going into this next winter respiratory viral season? 
LEE: Traditionally, flu season occurred near winter, and we saw an uptick of flu cases in the hospital and in our ICUs; however, this last year, we noticed a second peak around February. The reasons are unclear, but we do know that flu, COVID , and other respiratory diseases continue to cause critical illness in patients requiring admission to the ICUs. As strongly suggested by groups such as the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics,  I would reinforce the need to get annual vaccinations as that helps protect our patients from the uncommon – but very real – chance of dying from the flu or other viruses. This is especially true for our elderly, young, and immunosuppressed, such as cancer patients. 
HATTIS: The affordability challenges of US health care are significant and ubiquitous across our country and in our state.   One hope to make some progress here is to reduce the operational expense growth faced by our health care providers.   There is a lot of hype and hope that the uses of artificial intelligence can bring real and meaningful savings to health care operations.  From a bedside clinician’s perspective, are there any tangible examples you can point to right now of how AI is already helping to save money and what sort of hopes do you have for it going forward into the future? 
LEE: AI is everywhere. I cannot go through a day at the hospital without someone, patient or colleague, bringing up AI and how it is changing health care. I fully agree with your sentiment that AI, deployed properly and with the correct guardrails, will lead to much better patient outcomes, improved back-of-house processes, and,  hopefully, greatly reduce much of the busy work that leads to burnout and stress.  
For example, across MGB, we recently deployed an AI-based documentation system that supports one of the most painful parts of my personal workflow – writing patient notes. While I love the HBO TV show “The  Pitt” and how medically accurate it is to our clinical lives, what my colleagues and I joke about is that the clinicians in the show are not seen doing the many hours of documentation required for the vast numbers of patients they see.  Employing AI to help clinicians with their documentation burden by listening to our conversations with patients and then generating a note that we can review and modify after a patient encounter is already starting to be a time game-changer, and only one of many opportunities for AI in the health care space.  
HATTIS: You are also leading on some of MGB’s international partnerships, in particular you’re working to build a hospital in a part of the UAE that lacks health care facilities. You also continue, through your volunteer efforts, to try to support health care workers in Ukraine and other places through telehealth. Any reflections from these efforts that you think would be of interest to a Massachusetts audience?  
LEE: Yes, I lead a project where we are supporting the build of a new hospital in a rural and underserved area of the UAE. It’s an incredible project that I am excited about both in terms of mission and breadth as we are working with an incredible local partner. Similarly, the non-profit that I volunteer with primarily, Health Tech Without Borders, continues to serve and offer support in needed countries, with a good amount of effort in Ukraine. We recently deployed a new telehealth system to Dnipro, in Eastern Ukraine, near the front lines. It has already started helping to reduce the number of children needing to be transported — avoiding more danger for these kids needing to travel between hospitals. 
Interestingly, during a recent check-in with the Dnipro team, they shared that with the recent uptick in attacks in Western Ukraine, they are now supporting traumatically injured kids in Kyiv as they have had much more experience within Dnipro. What is even more interesting is that they have been using the system to support telehealth, outpatient visits for their regular population of patients, across all specialties from pediatrics to cardiology and more. This just shows how telehealth is the future and can scale rapidly even in conflict zones.  
HATTIS: During the height of the pandemic, we also talked about how your family was doing – especially your then-5-year-old son – while you were devoting enormously long days to the frontlines of patient care. How’s your family doing these days? 
LEE: Thank you for asking. My family is doing well. Our son enjoyed his time out of school this summer. He is now his own person with his own personality and knows what gets me. I always know when he is mad at me because he will tell me that my jokes are not funny.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-14 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Drug overdoses in CT prisons raising alarms,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/14/drug-overdoses-in-ct-prisons-raising-alarms/,The number of overdoses reflects the challenge facing the DOC: keeping illegal drugs out of CT prisons and treating addiction within them.,"On July 21, Tracy Ciccone got a call from the warden at Garner Correctional Institution in Newtown. Her son, 32-year-old Tyler Cole, was being held in the facility awaiting trial. She said she expected the call to be about some kind of “little ruckus” that her son had caused at the facility. 
Instead, the warden told her that, hours earlier, Cole had been found dead. 
She said she barely remembers what happened after that. “I must have yelled or something, because I remember [my husband] Jason running down the hall and picking me up off the ground,” she said.
Cole is one of 15 people who have died from overdoses while in custody of the Department of Correction since 2023, according to information from the state’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The overdoses were from a range of drugs — prescribed and not — including fentanyl, cocaine, xylazine, synthetic cannabis, methadone and antipsychotic medications. They died in prisons, at hospitals, in halfway houses, and in their own bedrooms while on parole. 
After three fatal accidental overdoses in 2023, there were nine in 2024. In 2025, there had been three through July, according to the OCME data.
Nonfatal overdoses are also on the rise within the DOC. In recent months, the number of emergency calls for overdoses at prison facilities has increased notably — including an increase of about 30% in Somers, home of Osborn Correctional Institute.  
According to DOC data provided to the correction officers’ union and shared with the Connecticut Mirror, the number of ambulance calls to Osborn for “drug-related incidents” jumped from 16 in 2024 to 41 in the first half of 2025. At Cheshire Correctional Institute, there were 18 ambulance calls for drug-related concerns in all of 2024; that rose to 19 in the first half of 2025.
Data from the state Department of Correction obtained through an FOI request shows 74 “suspected overdoses” across 11 facilities from January through July 2025. More than a third took place at Osborn. 
The number of overdoses and overdose deaths reflects the intractable, overlapping challenges facing the Department of Correction: keeping illegal drugs out of state prisons and adequately treating addiction within them. 
Nearly three quarters of the state’s prison population struggles with substance abuse and needs treatment, according to a 2023 report from the Connecticut Sentencing Commission. For incarcerated women, the proportion was even higher. The same report found that a third of incarcerated people have mental health disorders that require treatment. A quarter of incarcerated people have both mental health and substance abuse disorders.
Drugs coming in
A drug known as K2 is the latest substance to vex correctional staff and threaten the lives of individuals in custody. Prisons around the country are struggling to keep it out. The mixture of chemicals, often bug sprays, with other drugs like marijuana and tobacco — which people then smoke — is difficult to track because it can enter prisons on pieces of paper. 
A formerly incarcerated person at Osborn Correctional Institution told CT Mirror he had seen inmates in his cell block smoking K2 by using a battery and a wire to ignite the paper and then inhaling the smoke using a pen cap or pen tube. 
“I have personally witnessed inmates rip their cell apart, hide under their bed while attempting to dig into the concrete floor, vomit uncontrollably, roll around and tossing on their bunk, become agitated and out-of-control and have to be sprayed with Mace and restrained, strip naked and feel hot or overheated, while others have passed out, fainted or became unconscious,” he wrote in a letter. 
The formerly incarcerated individual, who asked not to be named in this story over fear of retaliation, told CT Mirror that he’d seen correction officers ignore the presence of contraband in the facility, walk past inmates who were high and warn incarcerated people when officers would be coming to search their cells. 
But officers told CT Mirror that the presence of K2 is frustrating them, too. Rudy Demiraj, a representative for the correction officers union, said the presence of K2 was causing a “dangerous and volatile environment” inside the prisons. 
“I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Demiraj said, referring to K2. “I would say this is an epidemic.” As yet, no one has died of a K2 overdose in custody in Connecticut.
Joseph McCarley, a corrections officer at Cheshire Correctional Institute, said the overdoses had increased to a point where they were happening multiple times per day. If the incarcerated person was sent to the hospital, that meant officers would have to leave the already short-staffed facility, which could mean a partial or full facility lockdown, leaving incarcerated people unable to participate in activities.
“ It results in, a lot of times, facilities needing to deploy staff to handle these emergencies where they would otherwise be monitoring the inmate population,” Demiraj said. 
Demiraj said claims that officers were ignoring contraband and overdoses were “baseless” but said staff might be so overwhelmed dealing with the drug usage that they were being pulled away from normal inspections and other duties.
The power of the street drugs has dramatically increased over the past, say, 10 years.Former inspector general Robert Devlin
Other drugs, including fentanyl, are also finding their way inside. 
Ashley Morin died last August from an overdose of fentanyl mixed with other strong opioids. Morin, who was 32 years old and had just given birth, had only been in York Correctional Institution in East Lyme a few days after being arrested for violating a protective order. 
According to the Inspector General’s report, Morin said she was offered fentanyl by her cellmates before moving to a different cell. Officers who searched the cell found what they believed to be drugs, but the material later tested negative in a laboratory analysis. 
Former Inspector General Robert Devlin said that since Morin had entered the facility only a few days before her death, it was possible she’d managed to bring the drugs with her into the prison. He said he was aware of other cases where people had died in the custody of police departments after overdosing on drugs they brought into the department with them. 
“I find these cases really sad. It’s a very sad thing,” Devlin said. 
Several hypotheses exist around how the drugs are entering Connecticut’s prisons, but none have been proven. 
In 2023, after six incarcerated people died from fentanyl overdoses the previous year, Devlin said he was “determined to pursue” the causes of the deaths. But Devlin said in an interview with CT Mirror in early August that the department still didn’t get any answers. 
He said it’s difficult to get people to cooperate with law enforcement for investigations. Devlin said his office had tried to piece together connections between individuals in custody and people they knew outside of prison, but ultimately his office was unable to find the source of the drugs. 
“It’s wicked hard with substance abuse. It’s an extremely challenging thing to try and overcome it. I mean, people do. But regrettably, some people don’t. And the power of the street drugs has dramatically increased over the past, say, 10 years,” said Devlin.
And screening isn’t universal. Devlin said many people who regularly visit prison facilities — correction officers, maintenance workers, outside vendors — aren’t screened when they enter, and he suggested that the DOC employ more sophisticated testing processes.
Correctional staff suspect K2 may be entering facilities through the U.S. Mail. Demiraj said the union had spoken with the Department of Correction about either photocopying mail before it goes to incarcerated people or purchasing scanners that could pick up the presence of K2 in mail.
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said the department was working on purchasing mail-scanning machines that could detect any chemicals. 
Earlier this month, the state bond commission approved funding for four body scanners to be placed at York Correctional Institution in Niantic and Manson Youth Institute in Cheshire. But Demiraj told CT Mirror that the union was opposed to any requirement for officers to go through the scanners when they enter the facility, since the officers, he said, were not bringing in the majority of contraband. 
Banevicius said the installation of body scanners would “provide a noninvasive and effective way to detect hidden objects such as drugs.” He said the scanners, which the department plans to install in the lobby area of each of the prisons, would improve safety and decrease the need for strip searches. He added that staff bringing contraband into the facilities is not tolerated and said anyone who did “will be disciplined to the fullest extent possible.”

Treatment on site
While many of the overdose deaths in the last three years in the Department of Correction were the result of overdoses on street drugs, Tyler Cole’s case was different. According to the medical examiner, Cole’s death was from a combination of methadone and antipsychotic drugs he was prescribed, which was being administered while he was at Garner. 
A lawyer for Cole’s family, Ken Krayeske, recently filed a claim with the state’s Claim Commissioner asking for permission to sue the Department of Correction and requesting $25 million in damages. 
Krayeske said Cole told medical staff he’d been taking heroin, but the facility took over a month before prescribing him methadone. On July 19, he was prescribed 30 mg of methadone. The next day, he was given an additional 40 mg. Krayeske called the increase a “pretty outrageous” jump, which wouldn’t have given Cole time to build up tolerance to the drug. Cole died July 21.
Medical doctors with expertise in addiction medicine gave different responses to CT Mirror about the appropriateness of the methadone dosage Cole received. One doctor said the dosage would have been average or low if Cole was still using heroin, but high if he had, in fact, been abstinent. Another doctor said the dosage was appropriate regardless of whether he was actively using heroin. 
Krayeske said he felt it was “highly unlikely” that Cole had been using heroin while in Garner and noted that the medical examiner had not found any heroin in his body at the time of his death.
Krayeske also said that medical staff failed to evaluate Cole for symptoms of opioid withdrawal when he first entered the facility. 
If you are worried about overdoses occurring while people are incarcerated, … offering treatment … is going to be part of the solution.Dr. Ben Howell, Yale-New Haven Hospital
Cole had been arrested on several domestic violence charges, including disorderly conduct and third-degree criminal mischief, according to CT Insider.
To address the pervasiveness of addiction in its facilities, the Department of Correction administers a program known as medication assisted treatment, or MAT. The program launched in 2013, when DOC began a pilot program at the New Haven Correctional Center. 
MAT provides medication like methadone and buprenorphine, which suppresses withdrawal symptoms for people addicted to heroin or opiates. The program has expanded over the years, and as of last year some type of MAT existed in 10 of Connecticut’s 13 correctional facilities. 
Dr. Ben Howell, a doctor of internal medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital and one of the authors of a report making recommendations for which programs Connecticut should invest in to address the opioid crisis, said that MAT “absolutely” decreases opioid-related deaths. He also noted that the incarcerated population, as well as people who have recently left correctional custody, are at some of the highest risk for overdoses.
“ If you are worried about overdoses occurring while people are incarcerated, absolutely offering treatment, especially for opioid use disorder, is going to be part of the solution,” said Howell. 
According to DOC’s Banevicius, nurses who work for the department are required to complete an annual emergency response training that “reviews how to identify and recognize different medical emergencies including overdose, treatment and interventions for medical emergencies, and competency of emergency medication administration such as Narcan.” 
Correctional officers are trained in how to identify an opioid overdose, how to use Narcan or naloxone, the effects of xylazine, and how to identify, care for and manage someone who has been using synthetic cannabinoids — marijuana-like substances.
Each facility has a supply of the anti-overdose medication naloxone and at least one substance abuse counselor, who offers counseling to people in the facility who are struggling with substance use. 
But incarcerated people in Connecticut prisons are dying from overdoses often from controlled substances they were prescribed.

Just two days before Cole’s death, on July 19, 2024, 30-year-old Ronald Johnson also died of a methadone overdose at Garner. Johnson had been transferred to Garner from Riker’s Island prison in New York. 
Ronald Johnson’s father, Ronald Coleman, told CT Mirror that he knew his son had a substance abuse problem, although he wasn’t sure what drug he was taking. Coleman said Ronald was outgoing and charismatic. He made rap videos that he posted on YouTube, and the two of them enjoyed playing video games together. 
“He wasn’t a bad person. He just had an addiction that he couldn’t overcome,” he said. 
Coleman said his son eventually became homeless in the Bronx. When he was put in prison for probation violations, Coleman said, he felt that Ronald would be safe — off the streets and with food to eat every day. He saw it as a chance for Ronald to get better. 
Coleman said he didn’t understand why no one at the facility had noticed that his son was in medical distress.
Ronald Johnson’s mother, Jamie Johnson, said she couldn’t understand how he could have died from medications that the facility had prescribed.
According to an investigation by the Connecticut State Police, Johnson was found with an inmate request form in his right shirt pocket, on which he’d written that his feet were swelling, and he believed he was having an allergic reaction to methadone. One of the nurses at the facility wrote in the medical report that half of a white medication fell from Johnson’s bunk immediately after they began CPR. According to the state police report, which referred to a medical report by nurse, officials assumed the medication to be Vraylar, an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Johnson was not being prescribed this medication, according to the report.
In response to a question about Cole and Johnson’s deaths, Banevicius said the Department of Correction does not comment on current lawsuits. 
“That being said, the medical and correctional staff members of the department are deeply affected and work hard to prevent any untimely death of an individual under our supervision,” Banevicius said.

A strained system
The high prevalence of addiction — and the department’s struggle to keep prescribed and illicit drug use under control — has placed heightened strain not only on officers and facility staff but also on the wider social safety net in surrounding communities.
Ambulance companies that serve the towns of Suffield and Somers, where Osborn and MacDougall-Walker correctional facilities are located, have told CT Mirror that the number of calls they receive for overdoses is on the rise this year. 
Data from the Somers fire department shows that it received 142 calls from Osborn Correctional Institution from January through June 2025. Of those 142, about 65 were listed as possible overdoses or “altered mental states.” A number of other calls, which listed individuals as “unresponsive,” having an “unknown medical emergency” or a seizure, could also be connected to overdoses. 
Somers First Selectman Tim Keeney said the number of ambulance calls Somers received from Osborn has increased by 40% overall compared to last year. He estimates that about 30% of the calls are overdoses.

Keeney said he hasn’t fielded any complaints from residents about delays in service; the town prioritizes serving residents, he said. But town officials did try to set up a meeting with the warden at Osborn. The meeting was cancelled, and the town has had no communication with the Department of Correction since. 
Banevicius said that when an individual is having a medical emergency, the department “has a legal and ethical responsibility to immediately seek appropriate medical attention for the affected individual, which includes contacting emergency medical services without delay.” In the same way, he said, ambulances have the responsibility to “respond promptly” to emergencies. 
John Spencer, chief of the Suffield Volunteer Ambulance Association, said they noticed an uptick in overdose calls to MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institute in Suffield in April. He also said calls to the prison have represented an increasing percentage of the calls they receive. From July 2023 to June 2024, Spencer said, about 10% of their calls were from the prison. The following year, from July 2024 to June 2025, that had increased to 15%. 
Spencer said the ambulance association had no problem responding to calls at the prisons but said that the cost of responding to these calls is often more than the amount they are paid through the state Medicaid program. 
According to data prepared for the correction officers’ union by the state, the cost of emergency medical transports to prison facilities in Connecticut was about $539,000 for the six months from January through June 2025. In comparison, the cost was about $746,000 for all of 2024.

No antidote for grief
Meanwhile, the family members are dealing with their grief. They say they want accountability for what happened to their sons. 
“It was unimaginable and it’s hard,” Ronald Johnson’s mother, Jamie, said. “I’ve been living with this every day. I think of my son every day. How? Why? What really happened?”
She described her son as a “standup person” — someone friendly who would stick up for people who were being bullied.

His father Ronald Coleman said he processed the grief mainly by throwing himself into work. He works in security and started making DoorDash deliveries. He got his commercial driver’s license, something he said he’d talked about doing with his son, so they could go trucking together. 
“No amount of money is going to bring my son back. That’s not my thing. My thing is, how many other young men is this going to happen to before somebody notices that there’s something wrong?” he asked. 
After Ciccone, Cole’s mother, found out the cause of death was methadone and prescription drugs, she started looking for an attorney. She said she couldn’t understand why Cole received methadone a month after he’d already been at the facility. 
Ciccone said her son enjoyed fishing and that he worked for a period of time with a neighbor who did landscaping. She said he also enjoyed spending time with his son, Brantley, who looks just like Cole did when he was young. 
Cole was doing well for a few years after his son was born, Ciccone said, but things would get difficult when he didn’t take his medication for bipolar disorder. Cole ended up back in Garner after violating a restraining order, which was a violation of his probation, Ciccone said. He was still waiting to go to court when he died in Garner. 
Ciccone said she can’t talk about her son’s death; if she does, she’ll burst into tears. She channels her energy into her grandson Brantley, now 9 years old.

His leadership decisions have come under scrutiny by attorneys inside and outside of the agency. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Conflict raging within the state public defense agency has sidetracked a capital murder case while competing factions wrestle for control.
The internal fight playing out in state district court filings — set against a backdrop of personnel investigations, alleged retaliation, an effort to unionize, secret hirings, disputes about qualifications, a judge’s recusal and the firing of a decorated attorney by voicemail — chilled legal observers who say Brandon Barrett, the agency’s acting director, violated state law by meddling in the case.
“What makes it unusual is that the interim director has struck several disabling blows at his own agency,” said Eric M. Freedman, a distinguished professor at Hofstra University School of Law.
Barrett denied allegations and downplayed concerns about turmoil within the State Board of Indigent Defense Services, known as BIDS, that surfaced after former director Heather Cessna stepped down two months ago. She warned in a Kansas Reflector podcast that a constitutional crisis was inevitable because of systemic underfunding by state lawmakers.
Such a crisis is evident in the case of Kraig Kahler, who was sentenced to death for murdering his estranged wife, two daughters and grandmother-in-law in 2009 in Burlingame. With his conviction and sentence upheld on appeal, the case is at the stage where specialized attorneys examine constitutional issues, such as whether he previously received effective legal assistance.
But the case has been placed in the hands of first-year attorneys at BIDS who blamed their employer in court filings for failing to produce qualification standards for such cases or hire a qualified attorney to lead the case. They also asked the court to block Barrett from interfering with their work.
Even the Kansas Attorney General’s Office told the court that Kahler deserves better representation.
Barrett refused an interview with Kansas Reflector but responded to questions in writing. He asserted that his efforts to reassign attorneys didn’t amount to interference in the case.
“Every administration faces difficulties but I do not view this situation as embarrassing personally or as part of the agency,” Barrett wrote. “The BIDS attorneys believe they are doing the right thing. That’s laudable.”
The Kansas Supreme Court appointed retired Judge Merlin Wheeler to take over the case. Wheeler has summoned attorneys to a Monday hearing to figure out who should represent Kahler.

‘Untenable and retaliatory’
The Attorney General’s Office objected in July to allowing first-year attorneys Alisha Mehdi and Rebecca Halff to represent Kahler in his post-conviction appeals.
The two public defenders, who are part of what’s known as the Capital Habeas Office at BIDS, recognized they lacked the necessary experience to handle the case on their own. The problem, Mehdi told the court, was that BIDS had neglected its obligation to establish qualification standards for such cases and did not employ an attorney who would meet prevailing standards.
At the time, Tricia Rojo Bushnell — best-known for her work with the Midwest Innocence Project — was leading the office on a contract basis. She had the necessary experience with death penalty cases but wasn’t licensed to practice law in Kansas.
Bushnell bristled with frustration when she couldn’t get overtime approved for her overworked and understaffed office, then learned that Barrett had met in secret with a prosecutor — not a defender — in Nebraska to replace her as the office chief.
While Bushnell worked to find an outside attorney willing to work with the younger staff on the Kahler case, Barrett secretly reached a deal with Jason Belveal, of Holton, and Mark Henricksen, of Oklahoma, to take the reins instead.
Belveal’s Aug. 15 appearance in the court record blindsided the team that had been working on the Kahler case. And Henricksen falsely told the court he met with Kahler and received the client’s support. Henricksen would later blame that mistake on a paralegal.
The BIDS attorneys cried foul when they discovered Osage County District Judge Taylor Wine had held conversations with Belveal that were not part of the court record. Wine recused himself on Aug. 22.
Bushnell believed Barrett had created “an untenable and retaliatory work environment” that undermined her abilities to lead the office, as she wrote in a formal complaint on Aug. 17 to the BIDS board chair. The board chair forwarded the complaint to Barrett, who fired Bushnell in an Aug. 20 voicemail.
“The decision has been made to separate you from that employment at this time,” Barrett said in the voicemail, which Kansas Reflector obtained. “Since you don’t have benefits, there are no benefits to continue, and if you have any questions about retrieving any items or returning any information in your possession, please contact (the HR director). This is the final decision of the executive branch. Thank you.”
The feedback loop — where complaints about Barrett and the administrative office go to Barrett, who is also the agency’s chief counsel — is at the center of efforts by rank-and-file public BIDS employees to unionize.
Internal emails obtained by Kansas Reflector show the BIDS board recently authorized multiple investigations into undisclosed personnel matters at the agency.
Lindsie Ford, a senior assistant public defender, said in an interview that a union is necessary to stem widespread fears of retaliation.
“You have to go to the people you have concerns about with your concerns and just hope for the best,” she said. “It’s not creating an environment where people feel safe.”
Ford said she was afraid she would face retaliation for agreeing to be interviewed for this story.
 
Ron Wurtz, a former BIDS board chair, urged board members at their Sept. 5, 2025, meeting in Topeka to “talk to the people in the field, talk to the public defenders and see what’s going on out there.” (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
‘Devastating, chilling effect’
Ron Wurtz, a former BIDS board chair, and Rebecca Woodman — two attorneys with decades of experience in death penalty cases — separately wrote the current board to express concerns with Barrett and the Kahler case.
They believed Barrett’s actions violate a state law that prohibits BIDS administrators from interfering in cases.
“The summary dismissal of Ms. Bushnell for efforts to help her office to represent their client is chilling further zealous efforts on behalf of other clients,” Wurtz wrote. “I have spoken to a number of BIDS lawyers, including chief public defenders, who have expressed this sentiment. Several expressed the fear that, if this interference with representation continues, they will be forced to walk away from the law’s highest calling — defending life and freedom.”
Woodman wrote that Barrett’s actions created the risk of “a devastating, chilling effect on the ability to render the effective assistance of counsel, no matter how qualified.” Because the stakes are highest in a capital case, she wrote, the result “can literally mean the difference between life and death.”
Both were among nine individuals who asked to speak at the Sept. 5 meeting of the BIDS board in Topeka. They waited for hours while the board met in secret to discuss unexplained personnel matters. Then, with no public discussion, the board approved contracts for Belveal and Henricksen to take over the Kahler case.
Those who signed up to talk were granted 90 seconds apiece at the end of the board meeting. Ford wasn’t happy about the time restriction.
“I have to say, I can’t think of anything more appropriate than being given 90 seconds to address the concerns that we have outlined,” Ford told the board.
Four individuals who signed up for public comment were there to voice support for Barrett. They included Sarah McKinnon, who leads the Sedgwick County public defender office.
“I hate to see what’s going on here,” McKinnon said. “This is not what public defenders do. We don’t fight with each other. We are here supposedly for a common purpose, and that’s putting the client first. And I’m really deeply disappointed that that seems to be getting lost here.”
During the meeting, Barrett announced that Bushnell — the office chief he fired by voicemail — had left the agency to take a new job, and he wished her well. After the meeting, Barrett agreed to talk with Kansas Reflector. A few days later, he said he would only have time to respond to questions in writing.
Barrett asserted in his answers that it was appropriate to fire someone by voicemail, and that “reassigning a case is not interference.” He said he reassigned the case because Mehdi indicated in a court filing that she was not qualified to represent Kahler.
Barrett is one of three candidates who have had private interviews with the BIDS board for the director position. Ann Sagan, director of special projects at BIDS, and Clayton Perkins, the chief capital appellate defender, are the other candidates.
The board chair, Washburn University law professor Michelle Ewert, notified BIDS staff in an Aug. 29 email that the decision to hire a new director has been placed on hold “while an investigation involving confidential personnel matters is pending.”

‘Publish your damn story’
Kahler sent a handwritten note to Wheeler, the retired judge who has taken over the case, to “express my frustration” with the situation.
“I have a constitutional right to qualified and effective counsel and there have been many conversations about my representation outside of the courtroom and without informing me or informing my current representation,” Kahler wrote.
Mehdi, one of the young attorneys working the Kahler case, filed an emergency motion Aug. 29 asking the court to stop her employer from interfering. She said in her filing that Barrett had ordered the attorneys to leave the case, even though Kahler wanted them to remain.
Wheeler ordered all of the attorneys involved to attend a Zoom hearing Monday to sort out the mess.
Belveal and Henricksen, meanwhile, tried to meet with Kahler at the El Dorado Correctional Facility, but Kahler refused.
Freedman, the Hofstra University professor, helped inform the American Bar Association guidelines for capital defense work and is considered an expert in post-conviction death penalty cases. He said “we will all listen with interest” to Monday’s hearing to see what Wheeler does.
An experienced judge, Freedman said, could repair the self-inflicted damage to Kahler’s constitutional right to quality legal assistance by appointing a new attorney free from all the BIDS drama.
“It is solvable, but the judge has to be fully aware of the situation and intervene to solve it, which is one reason I wish you’d publish your damn story before that hearing,” Freedman said.
The U.S. Constitution guarantees defendants the right to effective and qualified legal counsel, and 84% of adult felony cases in Kansas require public defenders, according to the most recent BIDS annual report.
Ford said their job is to “protect the constitution, which, first of all, keeps everybody safe.” She rejected the public perception that “maybe there are some people who are less deserving of rights because we have decided that they are not good enough people.”
“It’s not about, necessarily, Kraig Kahler or your individual thoughts on him,” she said. “Every single one of the people in Kansas needs fair and just access to the criminal justice system. You need the protections that exist in the constitution.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9051347-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-14 05:56:26.495721

Politicians and commentators have criticized rhetoric used by those on the left and right. Kirk himself was an ardent debater, which makes his assassination even more chilling for those of us who believe our country depends upon the free and open exchange of ideas.
Some of the reaction to Kirk’s death has been outright scary, with social media calls for vengeance and retaliation (an arrest in the case was made Friday).
In this heated moment, I’d like to step back for our Sunday column space here at Kansas Reflector. Don’t worry, regular columnist Max McCoy will be back. We’re going to run a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial written back in 1922.
At the time, railroad strikes threatened commerce across the United States. Striking workers faced violence, with at least 10 slain, and officials tried desperately to restore order. In Kansas, Gov. Henry Allen urged officials to criminally charge anyone who picketed in support. Emporia Gazette editor William Allen White promptly put up a small sign in his newspaper’s front window backing the strikers. He was arrested on June, making national news. While charges against him were dropped in December, the short piece he wrote about the situation on July 27, 1922, has endured.
Throughout the editorial, White deals with the most fundamental tensions in our democratic society: the freedom of speech, the fear of disorder and the worry that misguided ideas will triumph. The situation he faced differs from today, but his words struck me as worth a read.

To an anxious friend
You tell me that law is above freedom of utterance. And I reply that you can have no wise laws nor free entertainment of wise laws unless there is free expression of the wisdom of the people — and, alas, their folly with it. But if there is freedom, folly will die of its own poison, and the wisdom will survive. That is the history of the race. It is proof of man’s kinship with God. You say that freedom of utterance is not for time of stress, and I reply with the sad truth that only in time of stress is freedom of utterance in danger. No one questions it in calm days, because it is not needed. And the reverse is true also; only when free utterance is suppressed is it needed, and when it is needed, it is most vital to justice.
Peace is good. But if you are interested in peace through force and without free discussion — that is to say, free utterance decently and in order — your interest in justice is slight. And peace without justice is tyranny, no matter how you may sugarcoat it with expedience. This state today is in more danger from suppression than from violence, because, in the end, suppression leads to violence. Violence, indeed, is the child of suppression. Whoever pleads for justice helps to keep the peace; and whoever tramples on the plea for justice temperately made in the name of peace only outrages peace and kills something fine in the heart of man which God put there when we got our manhood. When that is killed, brute meets brute on each side of the line.
So, dear friend, put fear out of your heart. This nation will survive, this state will prosper, the orderly business of life will go forward if only men can speak in whatever way given them to utter what their hearts hold — by voice, by posted card, by letter, or by press. Reason has never failed men. Only force and repression have made the wrecks in the world.

Read More,"By Ryan Colasanti   NEWARK — The Fightin’ Blue Hens offense started at their own 22 yard line with just over two minutes to play and one timeout remaining. UConn led UD by three in the twilight of the back-and-forth game. Junior quarterback Nick Manicucci and the Blue Hen offense traversed the field to the Huskies 26 yard line setting the stage for graduate kicker Nate Reed.
Earlier in the quarter, Reed missed a 47 yard attempt that would’ve tied the score. This kick was four yards closer, but with even more pressure attached. With two seconds remaining, the ball was snapped, the holder placed it and Reed sneaked it barely above the crossbar. Reed completed his chance at redemption.
Reed’s kick sent the game to overtime where Manicucci capitalized on the opportunity scoring the game winning touchdown in the Blue Hens 44-41 win over the UConn Huskies, Saturday evening.
“Everything that we believe in, we went back to those fundamentals and the foundational aspects of our program and we played harder than that team today and we finished today. And that’s just so special to be a part of,” head coach Ryan Carty said postgame.
UD’s fight was on display all game. The Blue Hens answered almost every scoring drive the Huskies mustered with one of their own. There were only two drives in which the Blue Hens failed to answer a UConn score, one of them Reed’s missed field goal.
The first career FBS game between the Huskies and Blue Hens was an offensive shootout.
The two teams combined for 52 points through the first half and over 600 yards of offense. The two offenses finished with over a thousand yards of offense combined in the programs’ first meeting since 1998.
Both offenses featured a balanced offensive repertoire amassing over 150 yards on the ground and through the air. The Blue Hens had the advantage in the running game with a game high 247 rushing yards. 179 of those yards came from senior running back Jo Silver.
Silver ran for a career high 70 yard touchdown in the first quarter after UConn tied the game with its own long touchdown run courtesy of redshirt junior Cam Edwards.
“As I was trying to reverse, they kind of like almost got a hand on me, but I was able to beat it obviously,” said Silver about his touchdown run. “And then when I was down the field, I turned around at the perfect time and saw him diving and I got my feet up.”
That run was just one of a couple career firsts for the New Jersey product. Silver finished the game with a career high in rushing yards and his first career game with multiple rushing touchdowns.
Silver’s teammate, Kyre Duplessis, put together a similar career defining outing.
In the absence of leading receiver Jake Thaw, Duplessis caught nine of his 11 targets for a career high 161 yards and a touchdown. Duplessis’ second touchdown of the season came on a 68 yard pass and catch down the left sideline. The Coastal Carolina transfer leaped above his defender on third down to come away with the contested catch and scurried down the left sideline into the endzone for the longest touchdown reception of his career. The play gave UD a 28-24 halftime lead.
“I knew I was very close to the sideline. I knew once I caught the ball I wanted to try and stay in and I did my best. I didn’t hear a whistle so I said ‘alright sweet’,” Duplessis said.
Despite the career day, UConn paced the passing game with 346 yards through the air. The Huskies threw 39 times completing 28 of them to 10 different pass catchers.
The defenses weren’t much of a factor in the contest, but when they needed to make a play the Blue Hen defense came up with their first sack of the game holding UConn to a field goal on the first possession of overtime. The stop meant a UD touchdown would win the game and the Blue Hens ran a quarterback run option play that worked all game long — Manicucci scored all three of his rushing touchdowns on the play — to win the game.
The Blue Hens will try and carry the momentum from their first home overtime win since 2017 into their first Conference USA game against Florida International University next Saturday.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4186v2-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-13 23:56:23.810120

California leaders wrapped this year’s legislative session Saturday afternoon, prolonged by last-minute backroom deals on climate and energy, sparking deep frustration among some lawmakers.


Three days before the scheduled end of the legislative session this week, Sen. Lena Gonzalez introduced legislation to limit Los Angeles’ controversial recent “mansion tax” on high-value real estate deals. She backed down just a day later. 
“We wanted more time,” she said. “We wanted to do more due diligence … There were so many other issues on the docket.”
The California Legislature slogged through a marathon final week this week, extending its session into Saturday to push through a major package of climate and energy policies. The Saturday vote was needed because Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire didn’t finalize their privately negotiated deal on how to extend the state’s cap-and-trade greenhouse gas emissions program until early Wednesday, past the normal legislative deadline for introducing bills. 
Lobbied heavily by interest groups across the state, the package took up significant energy in the final days of the session. 
Leaders also rushed through several Newsom administration budget measures that shield construction for the Los Angeles Olympics from environmental review, prop up struggling child care centers, bolster the state’s ability to recommend immunizations and allocate $70 million in new state general fund spending. 
The result? Other measures ran out of time. And, many Democrats were left grumbling about how business gets done on consequential measures — but they still overwhelmingly approved them. 
Sen. John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat who has served in the Legislature for a combined 11 years, said the week seemed to contain “the most number of issues that are big issues that have been addressed in the last days of session.”
“To the extent any of them had already been through the policy committees, that’s great,” he said. “To the extent they’re seeing sunshine for the first time, then not so great.”
Assembly Budget Chair Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat, attributed the time crunch partly to Democrats’ whirlwind weeklong efforts last month to place a congressional redistricting plan on the November ballot. 
Gabriel said he shares the frustration with the lengthy session. “It’s a very clear negotiating strategy to drag things out to try to create leverage at the last minute,” he said.
Speaking to reporters afterward, Rivas said the January wildfires, President Donald Trump’s policies and the state’s structural budget deficit also added to the Legislature’s work this year. But he deemed it“the most productive year over the past decade,” celebrating the energy and climate deals as well as a historic rollback of the state’s environmental law to clear the way for development. 
“With unity, with urgency and focus, this Assembly delivered,” he said in a floor speech. 
Disputed antisemitism measure goes to governor
Lawmakers did approve a series of high-profile measures to fight federal immigration crackdowns, boost transit-oriented housing, rein in the tech industry and expand labor’s reach. 
This week, the Legislature OK’d a pair of proposals to ban local, out-of-state and federal law enforcement from wearing masks on duty, a reaction to sweeping immigration raids by unidentified agents. They passed a labor-championed measure to allow Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize, tying it to an industry-friendly measure to lower companies’ insurance costs. They also gave the final greenlight to Senate Bill 79, a controversial measure allowing developers to build denser housing near transit regardless of local zoning regulations. 
In the wee hours of Saturday morning, lawmakers agreed to appropriate $10 million per year toward funding local news. Google has agreed to commit $10 million toward the effort as well.
Also heading to Newsom’s desk is a controversial measure that aims to prevent antisemitism in schools. The bill, supported by the legislative Jewish Caucus, was passed following emotional hearings and animated debates. Following the bill’s passage, a few pro-Palestinian protesters began shouting from the Assembly gallery, yelling, “You will all have blood on your hands” as lawmakers continued their business.
While supporters argue the legislation is necessary to protect Jewish students from discrimination, opponents, including major education associations and the American Civil Liberties Union’s political action arm, argued for months that the proposal risked “weaponizing” public education and censoring Palestinian-related instruction in K-12 schools.

Another bill awaiting Newsom’s signature would require human oversight when an employer primarily uses artificial intelligence for disciplinary purposes.
But lawmakers punted multiple tech measures to next year, including a proposal to require tests of automated decision systems before they can be used in important personnel decisions. This is at least the second time such efforts have stalled, amid strong opposition from business associations and health care providers. 
They also shelved a measure that would have restricted workplace surveillance by public and private employers, a victory for the California Chamber of Commerce. 
A controversial criminal justice bill that drew strong opposition from moderate Democrats failed to advance. The measure would have made low-level felony offenders eligible for diversion programs, allowing them to avoid jail time. 
Some Democrats including Stephanie Nguyen of Elk Grove, Maggy Krell of Sacramento and Anamarie Avila Farias of Concord joined Republicans in opposing the bill. 
Property tax limit, environmental rules fall short
The pileup of priorities caused some issues to fall by the wayside.
Gonzalez’s bill would cap the Los Angeles voter-approved tax on high-value real estate deals, currently 4 to 5.5% of the property’s value, over concerns it’s dampening construction.
The measure sparked opposition from tenants’ advocates, who campaigned for the tax to raise affordable housing funds, and from the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which opposes the tax. The bill is written to kneecap an anti-tax ballot initiative the association filed for next fall’s election.
The Long Beach Democrat said she’ll pick up the issue next year, and said she couldn’t meet with all sides this year in part because of the volume of priorities this session. 
Another issue that remains unresolved: How to restore environmental review requirements for the construction of certain manufacturing plants — a priority for environmental justice advocates. Newsom earlier this year strong-armed lawmakers into loosening those reviews, but McGuire and other Democratic leaders promised in June to revisit it this fall. 
But top Democrats failed to agree, angering colleagues. In a mad dash to show their efforts, lawmakers rolled out three last-minute proposals, but the only one to pass does little to address environmental concerns.

Rivas called the lack of progress “unfortunate,” and promised to convene a working group next year. 
“Certainly it is unacceptable that that work was not completed by the end of session,” he told reporters.
Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who chairs the budget committee, attributed the lack of a deal to a disagreement with the Assembly, and said redistricting took up negotiating time
“We had a lot on our plate, and it delayed resolution of some issues,” he said. “That being said, it’s all happening … I don’t want to be here on a Saturday, but so be it.”
Frustration permeates California Senate
As the session dragged to its conclusion, some lawmakers were ready for new leadership.
Frustrations spilled over Wednesday night in the Senate Budget Committee, when several lawmakers of both parties criticized Newsom’s administration and legislative leaders for asking them to approve millions of dollars of state spending with little notice. The bills had been unveiled the day before, with no time left to amend them. 
Several Democrats took issue with how leaders steered some funds to local projects without their input.
Sen. Chris Cabaldon, a Napa Democrat, singled out projects in the North Coast that would get funding and said he found “no basis” for why Californians and lawmakers statewide weren’t consulted.
“There are more than just a handful of disadvantaged communities, plus the North Coast, in California,” he said.
McGuire happens to represent that region. Altogether, his district would get upwards of $85  million through the bill for environmental, housing, transportation and fire protection projects. That includes about $50 million from the climate bond for the Great Redwood Trail, a plan McGuire has championed to convert 231 miles of old railway into a trail in Mendocino, Trinity and Humboldt counties. 
Cabaldon slammed the “concentration of decision-making power that has emerged through this process this year.” In an interview, he said he wasn’t blaming anyone specifically, but“everyone is frustrated” by how the week played out.
Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat, was more frank.
“The buck stops with the people in charge,” Menjivar said. “How everything transpired this week left a sour taste in people’s mouths. I don’t think a majority of us would want us to repeat this next year.”
After being told in the spring that lawmakers needed to cut funding for undocumented immigrants’ health coverage, she was angered not to have gotten the chance to weigh in on new spending, and complained to Senate leadership.
Following all the griping, McGuire announced this week that the Senate was moving up the date that incoming Senate leader Sen. Monique Limón of Santa Barbara would take over, to Nov. 17 instead of in January.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Iowa congressional candidates took time Saturday at the Polk County Democrats’ Steak Fry to condemn political violence in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killing in Utah.
The Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, an annual fundraiser, featured speeches from Democratic candidates for Iowa’s U.S. Senate race, as well as from the 3rd and 4th congressional district races. Van Hollen, who gave a keynote address at the event, spoke about Kirk’s death, saying the shooting is a reminder of “how fragile our democracy can feel,” while criticizing Trump’s response to the issue.
On Wednesday, Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot while answering a question at an event at Utah Valley University. The suspected gunman was identified and taken into custody Friday. Politicians and leaders mourned Kirk’s death and called for a change to prevent future politically motivated violence.

“The answer cannot be more violence,” Van Hollen said. “The answer cannot be vengeance. And sadly, the president is using this moment not to unite America against political violence, but to engage in finger pointing. But we will not be silenced. We will speak out for what we believe vigorously, courageously and peacefully.”
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said it has been a “really hard week” in light of Kirk’s death, and that Democrats, and all Americans, need to take steps to ensure these threats are eliminated.
“We don’t have to look very far to see other examples of violence that has occurred because of political leanings,” Hart said, in part referring to the fatal shooting of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman in June. “And none of us find that to be acceptable, because it simply isn’t. We live in a country that was founded on the principle that we could stand up in a place like this and express our feelings, our thoughts, our attitudes, our beliefs and our political leanings, and not get shot because we have an opinion or a thought that’s different than somebody else’s.”
In Iowa, there has been an outpouring of sympathy for Kirk’s family and calls to stop political violence. Speaking with reporters, Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate called for an end to political violence.
In recent days, there has been some criticism from Republicans and others of Iowans, including some teachers, who have made controversial social media posts about Kirk’s death.
Democratic Senate candidate Jackie Norris, the school board president for the Des Moines Public Schools, said political violence was unacceptable, and that teachers — alongside most people — should be more cognizant of what their are publicly posting on social media. However, Norris added, “we have to respect that people have different views,” including teachers.
“It is important that we tone down the rhetoric, but we also have to respect that (teachers) have strong feelings too,” Norris said. “It’s a balance.”
Van Hollen calls Democrats ‘spineless’ for not backing Mamdani
Van Hollen also told Iowans at the event winning in 2026 elections will mean Democrats must be outspokenly in support of Democratic candidates running in 2025 races — including New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.
The Maryland Democrat said Iowa would play an important role in the 2026 midterms — but that supporting Democrats in 2025 races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as for New York City mayor, will help build “momentum” for 2026.
Van Hollen criticized New York Democrats for not supporting Mamdani, who is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. He said many Democrats representing New York in the U.S. House and Senate have “stayed on the sidelines” as President Donald Trump and others have mobilized to defeat the Democratic candidate.
“That kind of spineless politics is what people are sick of,” Van Hollen said. “They need to get behind him and get behind him now.”
Van Hollen criticized other aspects of the Democratic Party, saying the Biden administration was “feckless” in holding the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accountable to U.S. and international law. But he largely focused his remarks on Trump and Republicans in control of Congress.
In addition to talking about Medicaid cuts and criticizing Trump’s foreign policy decisions, Van Hollen said the Trump administration was violating people’s constitutional rights by pursuing mass deportations. The Maryland Democrat gained a significant national platform earlier in 2025 for his work involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador erroneously and held in the country’s megaprison.
Van Hollen was one of the major advocates for returning Abrego Garcia to the country and allowing his case to go through the U.S. court system. At the Saturday event, Van Hollen told Iowans he was advised not to pursue the issue as immigration was not a winning topic for Democrats — but he said he continued to fight for Abrego Garcia’s due process rights because “our democracy cannot survive on silence or equivocation.”
“And lo and behold, Americans across the political spectrum do believe in the red, white and blue essential right to due process in the United States of America,” he said. “They do believe in the principle that no one in America — I mean, no one — should be disappeared by the state without having a chance before a court of law. And Americans understand this is not about one man. It’s about all of us. Because when you strip away the rights from one person, you threaten the rights of all, of all of us.”
Abrego Garcia has been returned to the U.S., though the Trump administration has stated they intend to deport him again, potentially to the country of Eswatini.
Van Hollen said he would “never, ever apologize for standing up for anybody’s constitutional rights,” and said Democrats need to do more to speak out on issues they believe are important, even if polls or pundits say the topics are not politically advantageous. This will be especially important in states like Iowa, he said.
“We can and we will win here again, if — if — we speak to our core values, if we show people what we will stand up for and we will fight for,” Van Hollen said. “That’s why it’s great to be here to flip steaks and flip seats.”

(File photo provided by Clemson University)Clemson University suspended an employee Saturday following social media posts that mocked the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, as the Legislature’s GOP leaders called for an emergency meeting of the school’s governing board.
The suspension came two days after Clemson College Republicans began flagging social media posts of employees’ reactions to Kirk’s death Wednesday. Of the three people the college chapter called out — including two assistant professors — it is unclear who is suspended.
The public Upstate university declined to provide any further information on the “personnel matter.”
The suspension announcement followed outcry online from state politicians, Clemson students and alumni and Republican members of South Carolina’s congressional delegation.
“This action reflects the seriousness with which Clemson approaches violations of its standards and values,” reads the statement posted about noon Saturday. “We understand the frustration, and we share the deep concern over the nature of these posts.”
Also on Saturday, GOP leaders of both Statehouse chambers called on Clemson’s Board of Trustees to meet and “take immediate and appropriate action.” The three-paragraph letter did not specify what they wanted the board to do.
“We were shocked and saddened this week by the murder of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus. It leaves a dark stain on our nation’s history,” reads the letter signed by the Senate president, House speaker and chief budget writers of each chamber.
“In its aftermath, several Clemson University faculty made vile and troubling comments,” it continued. “While the University has issued a statement, it fails to address the gravity of the matter.”
The letter, dated Saturday, was posted on social media shortly after Clemson’s announcement.
House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, one of the four signers, said the leaders wanted to make clear that the college’s first statement was not enough.
That four-paragraph statement, posted Friday afternoon, said “Clemson University unequivocally condemns any and all expressions that endorse, glorify or celebrate political violence. … This is an opportunity for each of us to stop and consider our core values of mutual respect, integrity and personal responsibility.”
Bannister told the SC Daily Gazette the trustees need to meet and take “fairly significant action” but did not say whether that should mean firing the employees.
“I think they need to talk to the professors, look at what was posted,” said the Greenville Republican. “The professors should be given an opportunity to explain their position, and then they should make a decision based on what’s the right path forward for Clemson.”
Also signing the letter were Senate President Thomas Alexander and Senate Finance Chairman Harvey — both Clemson graduates — and House Speaker Murrell Smith. They did not immediately return messages from the Gazette.
It’s unclear whether firing is an option.
The university’s latest statement said an investigation into the posts continues and the school would “act within the bounds of the law” and university policies.
A state law dating to 1950 makes it illegal to “discharge a citizen from employment or occupation” because of their “political opinions or the exercise of political rights and privileges guaranteed to every citizen.” But South Carolina is also an at-will employment state, meaning employers generally can fire an employee for any or no reason.
Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012 to combat progressive politics on college campuses, was shot in the neck about 12:20 p.m. Wednesday as he debated with students at Utah Valley University. About 3,000 people gathered outside for one of Kirk’s signature “prove me wrong” events.
He was answering a question about mass shootings when he was hit by a single bullet. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital. On Friday morning, officials announced the arrest of a 22-year-old Utah man, who was not a student of that college.
“In my opinion any post that indicates this was acceptable behavior is out of line,” Bannister said.
The social media posts flagged by the college GOP chapter came from two assistant professors and an employee who appears to work in operations. None of the employees responded to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.

California lawmakers passed a six-bill climate and energy package extending cap and trade to 2045, expanding the state’s wildfire fund, approving new oil drilling, and opening the door to a regional power market.


Gov. Gavin Newsom closed out the legislative year with one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades — a package that could give him a presidential debate-stage talking point on rising energy costs as the Democratic Party shifts its focus to affordability.
The six-bill deal — passed Saturday after lawmakers extended their session by an extra day because of last-minute dealmaking — was sold as a way to ease gas prices and soaring electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs.
Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills. They also will get some protection from utilities hiking rates based on the cost of wildfire-proofing their infrastructure, such as by putting power lines underground. But they’ll also continue paying $9 billion over the next decade into a fund to compensate wildfire victims.
The package of legislation now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature. 
Newsom and his allies, who negotiated the package in the final days of the legislative session, said the state needed to allow more permits to drill oil to head off more refinery shutdowns that could send gas prices soaring.
Critics said the biggest winners of the maneuvering were the oil industry and the state’s major utilities. Oil drilling measures advanced in Kern County after refiners threatened to shutter plants. Utilities gained sweeping new wildfire liability protections and the ability to join a regional power market — a step critics warned could tether California to fossil-fuel states at a time when the Trump administration is moving to roll back clean energy.
Michael Wara, a Stanford legal scholar focused on energy policy, called it “astonishing” that lawmakers managed to pass so many major bills at once, including the two-thirds vote to reauthorize cap-and-trade. California is making steady progress in shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, even as wildfires complicate the transition, and while the measures were imperfect, they were necessary, he said.
“I’ve been a part, over the last decade, of getting individual tweaks done in each of these areas — but the idea that we would get them all done at once, on time, when we needed to, is astonishing to me,” Wara said. “Are the bills perfect? No, from my perspective they’re not perfect, but they are all material improvements over the status quo.”
The future of cap and trade reinforced
At the center of the bargain was the extension of California’s cap-and-trade system — rebranded by Newsom as “cap and invest” — through 2045. The extension, hammered out in backroom talks, was one of the most divisive elements of the package.
The carbon-trading program, launched in 2013, is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The program sets a strict cap on emissions for polluters and hands out a limited supply of permits companies can sell to other polluters if they cut enough emissions.
The final agreement on the program preserved rules that let oil companies avoid paying the full cost of their emissions while leaving untouched a cap on carbon prices. That setup shields polluters while leaving consumers potentially exposed to higher gas prices, experts said.
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas stood by the energy package on Saturday, arguing the measure to boost in-state oil production and keep refineries from closing would keep prices down at the pump. “Altogether,” he told reporters, the deal “is going to result in some billions of dollars in savings.”
The California Chamber of Commerce was out front in opposing the cap and trade deal, arguing it would make energy less affordable by taking credits away from gas customers and giving them to electric utilities — hurting families, renters, and small businesses that still depend on natural gas. The powerful business group has poured at least $6.9 million into legislative races over the past decade, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.
The oil industry’s chief lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Association, which had pushed back early on, eventually settled into neutrality. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates remained staunchly against it, saying the program protects oil and gas companies while leaving nearby low-income communities to bear the health costs of pollution.

A group of seven environmental justice groups from across the state, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Asian Pacific Environmental Network Action, said the extension “institutionalizes inequality in California’s climate policy.”
“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” the groups said.
Alongside reauthorization of the program, a companion bill provided a blueprint for how the state should spend its revenues, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget.
Questioning the affordability premise
The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt. Affordability has become the defining fault line in Democratic politics since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, powered by a campaign fixated on cutting costs and fighting inflation.
At the same time, Democrats are leaning into the rhetoric of “abundance,” a term popularized by columnist Ezra Klein to capture the idea that more housing, clean energy and infrastructure can ease scarcity and lower costs. But some consumer advocates and Capitol insiders argue the measures won’t ultimately help consumers.
“I don’t know how any of this saves money,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “But this is the new state of Sacramento. I think it happened because of Trump, honestly, I think this is all about abundance and Trump, and Democrats trying to make a name for themselves by dumping regulation.”
Republicans, too, slammed the package, but they called it over-regulation that would continue to keep gas and energy costs high. Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, called Democrats’ goals of using the cap-and-trade dollars to improve transit “unrealistic” when Californians “are not going to give up driving their cars,” and said the party’s stated three goals can’t coexist.
“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said. “People aren’t going to be able to live here.”
Newsom’s push to keep gasoline prices and energy bills in check — a message potentially aimed as much at a national audience in a future presidential bid as at Californians — meshed with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’s early pledge to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.”
Meanwhile, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and his team resisted giving ground to oil and gas interests without securing gains for environmental and social justice priorities, given the concentration of polluting industries and poor air quality in low-income communities.Cap-and-trade renewal took on urgency as carbon auctions faltered and Trump singled out the program — originally set to expire in 2030 — as potentially unconstitutional.
A ‘giveaway to big oil’?
At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind. After blasting the industry as deceitful and politically manipulative for years, Newsom reversed course. His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.

While much of the governor’s original oil refinery proposal was pared back in the Legislature, drilling approvals advanced in Kern County. That was a victory for Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, who represents the county. Grove has spent a decade pushing to keep drilling and its middle-class jobs alive there. 
The approved oil permits, she said, “will result in California-compliant oil that is the most regulated in the world.”
Nevertheless, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, criticized the oil deal from the Assembly floor Saturday as a “giveaway to big oil.”
“The thing we need to focus on is a controlled and managed phaseout of fossil fuel, like the dinosaurs that they process, the petroleum-oil, fossil-fuel industry fuel is dying out,” Lee said. “Refineries and facilities are closing, not just in California, but in Texas and across the world.”

Lawmakers also established a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.
Layered onto those debates was a high-stakes battle over utility finances. Wildfire liabilities loomed over investor-owned utilities, especially Southern California Edison, now under scrutiny for its potential role in the Eaton Fire in Altadena. Newsom pressed to expand California’s $18 billion wildfire fund — a safeguard supporters said was vital to protect ratepayers if utilities sparked future blazes, but one that critics warned could ultimately drive consumer bills higher.
Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines. Supporters say it could cut costs for customers and steady the grid during crunch times like heat waves, while supporting in-state clean power producers who could sell excess electricity to neighbors.
Consumer advocates, led by The Utility Reform Network, warned the change could weaken California’s control over its clean energy agenda and hand more power to a federal government under Trump that is siding with fossil fuels. Some environmental and consumer groups shared that concern. 
The shift is important because California has spent decades building one of the cleanest grids in the world and the move to open up that system to other Western states could reshape how both renewable and fossil power move across the region.

Mitch Rosenwald, and Rep. Michele Rayner, all Democrats. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — During his time in office, Gov. Ron DeSantis has been aggressive in vetoing appropriations in the state budget for LGBTQ programs.
Cognizant of that fact, some Democratic legislators, say, they’ve been able to continue support for those programs by omitting any direct references to the LGBTQ community in their appropriation proposals.
But that gambit may be coming to an end, one lawmaker suggested on Saturday.
“I think you need to be prepared for what is coming,” warned state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D-Orlando) on Saturday, speaking during the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus summer meeting in Tampa. “Yes, we should continue to urge our senators and our representatives in the Legislature to fund these programs. We should not stop. “
But Smith fears the state’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiatives led by Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia are taking aim at local governments for funding anything associated with DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). And he’s concerned that could lead to legislation barring municipalities or counties from funding such efforts in the future.
Last month, 16 Orange County employees were served with investigative subpoenas regarding the county’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; climate initiatives; procurement; and contracts or grants. They were issued after Ingoglia said it was “probable” that Orange County employees tried to hide information when his DOGE team began examining spending practices within the county government.
Among the agencies caught up in the search are the Zebra Coalition Inc. and Zebra Youth Inc., plus the Orlando Youth Alliance Inc., according to the Orlando Sentinel. The paper reported that while those groups support LGBTQ communities, the county argued the programs were open to all.
“While we will fight the proposal if it comes, I believe a proposal may come that will basically now finally prohibit our local governments from being able to fund these organizations through grants, because they’re gonna say putting a roof over a young person’s head who is queer or is LGBTQ is diversity and inclusion and now prohibited under Florida law,” Smith said.
No such legislation has been introduced to date, Smith acknowledge, but “if rainbow crosswalks attached to the interim memorial of Pulse nightclub are fair game for this depraved administration, they will come for other things, too, and we have to be prepared to fight back against it,” he said.
Banning the transgendered from owing guns?
Joining Smith in an hourlong discussion at the Westshore Grand Hotel in South Tampa were three other Democratic LGBTQ members of the Legislature: Sen. Shevrin Jones (D-Miami Gardens), Rep. Michele Rayner (D-St. Petersburg), and Rep. Mitch Rosenwald (D-Oakland Park).
The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was never explicitly mentioned during the discussion, although his death was indirectly referenced when the lawmakers were asked to opine about a news report referencing the transgender community published last week.
CNN reported that in the aftermath of the Minneapolis Catholic Church shooting that took place late last month, senior U.S. Justice Department officials are reportedly weighing proposals to limit transgender people’s right to possess firearms.
Smith called it “a bigoted and transphobic attack,” and then asked the audience to think about how conservatives had responded to mass shootings in the immediate past.
“If it is a Hispanic person that has committed a violent crime, they want to build a wall,” he said. “If it is a Black or African-American person who has committed a violent crime, it is that we need to target Black Lives Matter and we need to erase honest history. If it is a trans or an LGBTQ person who commits a violent crime, we have proposals like this.
“But if it’s a white male American, the response in the last 24 hours has now been, ‘We need to understand what we’re doing to young men and stop giving them access to video games and understand what they’re going through,'” he said. “I think we should have empathy for all people regardless of what their background is. And we have to call out bigoted, discriminatory policies for what they are.”
Rayner called the report “a distraction” and a way to paralyze members of the LGBTQ community to not commit to any positive actions.
“These are very unserious people,” she said. “These are people who are not rigorous in their actual thinking capacity. They’re just not, and so ultimately we have to see it for what it is.”
If Republicans were serious about addressing mental health, “they would just fund mental health. Period,” Jones said to cheers. “The only reason why Republicans continue to beat up on our transgender community is because they believe that’s their easy target.”
He added that it is incumbent upon LGBTQ lawmakers to fight as hard for their constituents as they ever have.
“Too often, the LGBTQIA+ community, we feel that sometimes we have to kowtow to individuals who wouldn’t spit on us if we were on fire. And so, because of that, I want to make clear that those of us who run for office … don’t allow this moment to allow us to be scared to speak up. Because there are young people and there are people dependent on our mouth, and if we have a seat at the table, dammit, we better use every ounce of our being to pushback on the BS that the Republicans are doing.”

“I see people from all walks of life here today, and that’s truly, truly beautiful,” said Julian Camera, an organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado. “We’re going to overcome this. We’re going to keep fighting.”
The dormant Hudson Correctional Facility is owned by a real estate investment trust and was formerly leased to private-prison company The GEO Group, which operated the prison for a span of just five years after its 2009 opening, during which the facility housed inmates from Alaska. The prison has a capacity of about 1,200 beds — only slightly less than the population of the town of Hudson, about 30 miles northeast of Denver on Interstate 76.

The facility is one of six potential new ICE detention centers in Colorado revealed by the ACLU as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit earlier this year. Internal documents obtained by The Washington Post last month again indicated that the facility, along with another dormant prison in Walsenburg, is under consideration by the agency, but no formal announcement has yet been made. Representatives for ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
Colorado is currently home to only one ICE detention center, an Aurora facility also operated by The GEO Group. The potential expansions, which could triple the state’s immigrant detention capacity, are part of the Trump administration’s plans for a sweeping mass deportation program, bolstered by $45 billion in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved in July.
“That money doesn’t just come from Hudson or Walsenburg — that’s everyone’s money,” Camera told the crowd. “That comes from Hudson, that comes from Denver, that comes from the state of Colorado, and the people of Hudson should be concerned. Why? Because now their city becomes dependent on tearing families apart.”










I see people from all walks of life here today, and that’s truly, truly beautiful ... We’re going to overcome this. We’re going to keep fighting.


– Julian Camera, organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado


In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Protesters at Saturday’s demonstration carried signs that likened ICE detention centers to concentration camps. Speakers especially objected to the opening of a new facility in a remote rural area, where detainees’ families and legal aid groups would find it more difficult to visit.

Hudson Mayor Joe Hammock told Denver7 last month that he would support the facility reopening “like any business that wants to open up in Hudson.” While operational, the facility supported about 200 jobs.
But Gina McAfee, statewide coordinator of Colorado Immigrant Protection Teams, pointed to studies showing that prisons don’t provide the economic benefits that local boosters often promise.
“The bottom line — I would ask, did Hudson’s economy improve when this facility was operational? We think not,” she told the crowd at Saturday’s protest.
“We urge you to push back on any local or state entity who needs to approve of the plan to reopen this facility,” McAfee added. “Let’s all just say no.”

,California,2025-09-13 18:15:00+00:00,CalMatters,Why California backed off again from ambitious AI regulation,Khari Johnson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/09/ai-regulation-on-hold-again/,A bill mandating disclosure and appeals for a wide range of AI decisions was delayed until next year for the third legislative session in a row. Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to consult on the measure.,"In summary
A bill mandating disclosure and appeals for a wide range of AI decisions was delayed until next year for the third legislative session in a row. Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to consult on the measure.




After three years of trying to give Californians the right to know when AI is making a consequential decision about their lives and to appeal when things go wrong, Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said she and her supporters will have to wait again, until next year.
The San Ramon Democrat announced Friday that Assembly Bill 1018, which cleared the Assembly and two Senate committees, has been designated a two-year bill, meaning it can return as part of the legislative session next year. That move will allow more time for conversations with Gov. Gavin Newsom and more than 70 opponents. The decision came in the final hours of the California Legislative session, which ends today. 
Her bill would require businesses and government agencies to alert individuals when automated  systems are used to make important decisions about them, including for apartment leases, school admissions, and, in the workplace, hiring, firing, promotions, and disciplinary actions. The bill also covers decisions made in education, health care, criminal justice, government benefits, financial services, and insurance.
Automated systems that assign people scores or make recommendations can stop Californians from receiving unemployment benefits they’re entitled to, declare job applicants less qualified for arbitrary reasons that have nothing to do with job performance, or deny people health care or a mortgage because of their race.
“This pause reflects our commitment to getting this critical legislation right, not a retreat from our responsibility to protect Californians,” Bauer-Kahan said in a statement shared with CalMatters.
Bauer-Kahan adopted the principles enshrined in the legislation from the Biden administration’s AI Bill of Rights. California has passed more AI regulation than any other state, but has yet to adopt a law like Bauer-Kahan’s or like other laws requiring disclosure of consequential AI decisions like the Colorado AI Act or European Union’s AI Act. 
The pause comes at a time when politicians in Washington D.C. continue to oppose AI regulation that they say could stand in the way of progress. Last week, leaders of the nation’s largest tech companies joined President Trump at a White House dinner to further discuss a recent executive order and other initiatives to  prevent AI regulation. Earlier this year, Congress tried and failed to pass a moratorium on AI regulation by state governments.
When an automated system makes an error, AB 1018 gives people the right to have that mistake rectified within 60 days. It also reiterates that algorithms must give “full and equal” accommodations to everyone, and cannot discriminate against people based on characteristics like age, race, gender, disability, or immigration status. Developers must carry out impact assessments to, among other things, test for bias embedded in their systems. If an impact assessment is not conducted on an AI system, and that system is used to make consequential decisions about people’s lives, the developer faces fines of up to $25,000 per violation, or legal action by the attorney general, public prosecutors, or the Civil Rights Department.
Amendments made to the bill in recent weeks exempted generative AI models from coverage under the bill, which could prevent it from impacting major AI companies or ongoing generative AI pilot projects carried out by state agencies. The bill was also amended to delay a developer auditing requirement to 2030, and to clarify that the bill intends to address evaluating a person and making predictions or recommendations about them.
An intense legislative fight
Samantha Gordon, a chief program officer at TechEquity, a sponsor of the bill, said she’s seen more lobbyists attempt to kill AB 1018 this week in the California Senate than for any other AI bill ever. She said she thinks AB 1018 had a pathway to passage but the decision was made to pause in order to work with the governor, who ends his second and final term next year.
“There’s a fundamental disagreement about whether or not these tools should face basic scrutiny of testing and informing the public that they’re being used,” Gordon said.
Gordon thinks it’s possible tech companies will use their “unlimited amount of money” to fight the bill next year.. 
“But it’s clear,” she added, “that Americans want these protections — poll after poll shows Americans want strong laws on AI and that voluntary protections are insufficient.”
AB 1018 faced opposition from industry groups, big tech companies, the state’s largest health care provider, venture capital firms, and the Judicial Council of California, a policymaking body for state courts.
A coalition of hospitals, Kaiser Permanente, and health care software and AI company Epic Systems urged lawmakers to vote no on 1018 because they argued the bill would negatively influence patient care, increase costs, and require developers to contract with third-party auditors to assess compliance by 2030.
A coalition of business groups opposed the bill because of generalizing language and concern that compliance could be expensive for businesses and taxpayers. The group Technet, which seeks to shape policy nationwide and whose members include companies like Apple, Google, Nvidia, and OpenIAI, argued that AB 1018 would stifle job growth, raise costs, and punish the fastest growing industries in the state in a video ad campaign.
Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, whose founder Marc Andreessen supported the re-election of President Trump, oppose the bill due to costs and due to the fact that the bill seeks to regulate AI in California and beyond.
A policy leader in the state judiciary said in an alert sent to lawmakers urging a no vote this week that the burden of compliance with the bill is so great that the judicial branch is at risk of losing the ability to use pretrial risk assessment tools like the kind that assign recidivism scores to sex offenders and violent felons. The state Judicial Council, which makes policy for California courts, estimates that AB 1018 passage will cost the state up to $300 million a year. Similar points were made in a letter to lawmakers last month.
Why backers keep fighting
Exactly how much AB 1018 could cost taxpayers is still a big unknown, due to contradictory information from state government agencies. An analysis by California legislative staff found that if the bill passes it could cost local agencies, state agencies, and the state judicial branch hundreds of millions of dollars. But a California Department of Technology report covered exclusively by CalMatters concluded in May that no state agencies use high risk automated systems, despite historical evidence to the contrary. Bauer-Kahan said last month that she was surprised by the financial impact estimates because CalMatters reporting found that automated decisionmaking system use was not widespread at the state level.
Support for the bill has come from unions who pledged to discuss AI in bargaining agreements, including the California Nurses Association and the Service Employees International Union, and from groups like the Citizen’s Privacy Coalition, Consumer Reports, and the Consumer Federation of California.
Coauthors of AB 1018 include major Democratic proponents of AI regulation in the California Legislature, including Assembly majority leader Cecilia Aguilar-Curry of Davis, author of a bill passed and on the governor’s desk that seeks to stop algorithms from raising prices on consumer goods; Chula Vista Senator Steve Padilla, whose bill to protect kids from companion chatbots awaits the governor’s decision; and San Diego Assemblymember Chris Ward, who previously helped pass a law requiring state agencies to disclose use of high-risk automated systems and this year sought to pass a bill to prevent pricing based on your personal information.
The anti-discrimination language in AB 1018 is important because tech companies and their customers often see themselves as exempt from discrimination law if the discrimination is done by automated systems, said Inioluwa Deborah Raji, an AI researcher at UC Berkeley who has audited algorithms for discrimination and advised government officials in Sacramento and Washington D.C. about how AI can harm people. She questions whether state agencies have the resources to enforce AB 1018, but also likes the disclosure requirement in the bill because “I think people deserve to know, and there’s no way that they can appeal or contest without it.”
“I need to know that an AI system was the reason I wasn’t able to rent this house. Then I can at an individual level appeal and contest. There’s something very valuable about that.”
Raji said she witnessed corporate influence and pushback when she helped shape a report about how California can balance guardrails and innovation for generative AI development, and she sees similar forces at play in the delay of AB 1018.
“It’s disappointing this [AB 1018] isn’t the priority for AI policy folks at this time,” she told CalMatters. “I truly hope the fourth time is the charm.”
A number of other bills with union backing were also considered by lawmakers this session that sought to protect workers from artificial intelligence. For the third year in a row, a bill to require a human driver in commercial delivery trucks in autonomous vehicles failed to become law. Assembly Bill 1331, which sought to prevent surveillance of workers with AI-powered tools in private spaces like locker or lactation rooms and placed limitations on surveillance in breakrooms, also failed to pass.
But another measure, Senate Bill 7 passed the legislature and is headed to the governor. It requires employers to disclose plans to use an automated system 30 days prior to  doing so  and make annual requests data used by an employer for discipline or firing. In recent days, author Senator Jerry McNerney amended the law to remove the right to appeal decisions made by AI and eliminate a prohibition against employers making predictions about a worker’s political beliefs, emotional state, or neural data. The California Labor Federation supported similar bills in Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, and Washington.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/042324_Sacramento-Works-Job-Center_MG_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-13 14:57:07.569892

A strong breeze cools the shade under large oak trees, and makes lounging and visiting with friends a more pleasant time as the heat of the day rises.
Wade makes the rounds, chatting with friends old and new. He stops kids riding horses to ask how they’re doing. He asks about the horses. He smiles and waves, laughing and telling stories before heading towards the fencing of the oval track where drivers train and race harness horses called Standardbreds.

Along the way, Wade spots a mechanical bull, promptly pulls off his boots and hops on. He rides with glee and to the amusement of the small crowd gathered to cheer him on. The crowd records his joy on cell phones held high. Eventually, he’s thrown off, but is all smiles. He accepts a few hugs as his reward, puts on his boots, then encourages the children to try their hand at bull riding.

“I love this,” he said, waving an arm to indicate the festivities around him. “I especially love seeing these kids out here riding. There’s a lot of our youth that come to shows like this and the horse races that are interested in horses, but they don’t even have a horse. Their parents and not any of their family members have horses.”

Wade wants to help kids in his community – especially those of color – learn equestrian skills as another way for them to get into college. He has made it his mission.

“Here I am, a cowboy, rancher, horse trainer, horse racer and a licensed official for the United States Trotting Association. I’m an equestrian consultant, calf roper, steer wrestler and do workshops to train our youth. If I could put all that on a business card, know what would be in the boldest print? 
“I’m a mentor,” Wade said.

“So I thought, you know what. I’m going to try and do everything I can to change that,” Wade said, before waving down two young men galloping across the green sward to chat them up. He asks if they’re enjoying themselves, about the horses they ride.

“What I do is try and pair these kids with someone that has horses. They get an opportunity to learn how to train, ride and care for them. If they’re really serious about what they’re doing, I make it possible for them to get their driver or jockey license, compete on a professional level. And for the ones not interested in that, we find activities for them too.” 
Wade walks back to the fence at the oval track, hitching up a booted foot to resume sharing his mission.

“Kids can also get involved in sports clubs like 4-H, learn a respectable trade like being a farrier, earning them a good living. It’s really about equestrian and agricultural activities, because it can get them a college scholarship. My own son is going to college on a rodeo scholarship, getting a full ride, if you know what I mean,” he said, smiling broadly.

Wade mentions a program for youth he’s starting with Rep. Rickey Thompson, a Democrat from Shannon. He hopes to help them “get started on the right path.”
“My path was out of love and necessity. Necessity as in making a living. I want to be a model of success to these kids so that they not just dream of success, but to have success,” he said. “I want to be for them what Lane Frost was for me. He was my bull riding idol. I loved that guy. He was awesome. Not only was he a great cowboy, he was a great person. He always took the time to stop and talk with kids. That made a big impression on me. I never forgot it.”

(Photo by Caroline Donovan/Integration and Application Network,UMCES)The reviews are in, and they’re not good: Commenters had stern words in the just-closed public comment period for the newly revised Chesapeake Bay agreement, a voluntary clean-up pact between the states that surround the nation’s largest estuary.
In more than 1,000 comments from scientists, advocates, regular residents, current and former legislators and even a former Maryland governor, the Chesapeake Bay Program was told that the proposed terms of the plan are too weak, especially considering that the bay states failed to achieve all the goals in the previous agreement .
Commenters, including leading environmental nonprofits, have largely panned the revisions to the expiring 2014 plan. They note that a critical pledge has not been met from that plan, to curb the damaging nutrient and sediment runoff that comes from agricultural fertilizers, human and animal waste and even vehicle emissions.
They took issue with lowered goals for underwater grass acreage and forest buffers, and for failing to mention the legally binding “Total Maximum Daily Load,” a restricted “pollution diet” for the bay set during the Obama administration. The document gives the bay states five more years before new pollution goals must be developed using an upgraded computer model.
And opponents noted the aversion in the new plan to climate change, referring only to “changing environmental conditions.” They faulted Bay Program leaders for not immediately granting a request from seven federally recognized Native American tribes to join as signatories.

“They’re unacceptable,” Patuxent Riverkeeper and longtime environmentalist Fred Tutman said of the revisions. “They’re not going to have the desired effect. How could they? They’re weaker. We’ve been failing with the other measures, and now we’re going to weaken those measures further.”
The new agreement comes as billions have been spent over the years for Bay restoration, which has reduced projected pollution loads into the bay, chiefly through major upgrades at sewage plants. But stemming the flow of pollution from farms — and an ever-increasing amount of developed lands — has proved much more vexing.
Despite those millions, 70.6% of the bay and its tributaries have not attained water quality standards, according to the latest metrics from the Bay Program. That’s compared to 73.5% of the bay in the late 1980s, when the restoration effort got off the ground.
The architects of the new plan face a delicate political situation. States with varying political leanings — not only Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia but West Virginia, Delaware, New York and Washington, D.C. — are all signatories and must agree on the changes. And then there’s the federal government, which signed the 2014 pact, but is also the legal enforcer of the Bay’s pollution diet.
President Donald Trump’s (R) return to the Oval Office has placed the bay restoration effort on a somewhat shaky footing. Trump has slimmed down federal environmental agencies, from the Environmental Protection Agency to the U.S. Geological Survey, amid a broader effort to slash bureaucracy. Trump’s administration has targeted environmental regulations for rollback and attacked renewable energy projects and associated tax incentives.
Unlike his first term, however, Trump first budget proposal this time did not cut funding for the EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program, which administers the multistate partnership. Bay Program officials say that federal agencies have remained at the table helping to shape the revised agreement.
But Bay advocates see Trump administration fingerprints on the revisions, including deleted references to diversity initiatives and climate change.
“I would be stunned if that [Trump administration policy] was not at least a significant part of the reason that this is so milquetoast,” said former Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening of the revisions.
But other observers have faulted the bay states just as much as Trump’s EPA.
“Maryland lacks the leadership — the bold leadership — that is necessary in this area,” said Gerald Winegrad, who served in the Maryland General Assembly from 1978 to 1994. “That’s the linchpin of what’s happening here.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) was elected chairperson of the Executive Council of state leaders overseeing by restoration, but Winegrad said he worries that Moore’s alleged aspirations for higher office — Moore has repeatedly denied he is running for president — make him less likely to challenge key industries, including agriculture.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a statement, representatives from the EPA’s Region 3, which includes all of the bay states, emphasized that the revisions “are being made jointly” by all members of the bay partnership, “informed by the public and stakeholders … These are not unilateral EPA actions or decisions.”
“EPA wears multiple hats when it comes to the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) Partnership. Specifically, EPA acts as a funder, regulator, and co-equal partner,” read the statement. “In these roles, EPA does not act alone.”
One particular portion of the agreement caught the attention of
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) led a letter of 23 bay-state members of Congress who argued that the document was not as ambitious as they had hoped. One thing that caught Van Hollen’s attention in particular was the section focused on nutrients, which called for the states to “continue to implement and maintain practices and controls to reduce excess nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment” through 2030.
By December 2030 — when a new computer model that estimates pollution in the Bay region will be completed — the goal would be updated with “revised targets.”
“T​​hey are giving themselves this long lead time — 2030 — to establish some of the goals when it comes to pollution reduction,” Van Hollen said. “I understand the need to gather the data, but it’s also important that between now and then, we continue to work hard to achieve the targets in the current agreement.”
Longtime Chesapeake Bay scientist Don Boesch, a former professor and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, argued that there is no reason to wait for the computer model to take action.
“The model is not going to lower the bar. It’s not going to say you need to do less. It’ll probably say you need to do more,” Boesch said. “So, let’s just do what we said we’re going to do.”

He joined with several other bay scientists from UMCES, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and Cornell in penning comments urging a renewed focus on nutrient reduction, and on new strategies to slow runoff — including by rewarding conservation practices based mainly on how successful they are.
Bay Program officials defended the agreement but indicated that changes could be coming in response to the public’s concerns. That could include a reference to the bay’s TMDL, said Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, which includes legislators from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia — and is a signatory on the Bay agreement.
“We tried to avoid what we thought were kind of unapproachable terms, like TMDL,” Killius said. “The stakeholders that really pay attention to those things took that as a sign that we are walking away. We can’t walk away.”
Killius said the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Management Board is now taking the comments under advisement. The group will likely adapt the agreement during a retreat at the end of September.
The revised agreement must be finalized by December, when the governors of the bay states will convene for an annual meeting, along with the other signatories of the agreement.
Killius noted that the agreement does call for a 0.2% improvement in water quality each year. And though it may sound “absolutely ludicrous” on its face, it reflects experts’ careful consideration of what is possible, given the bay’s current trajectory, she said.
“You want to stretch beyond what’s comfortable, because that’s how you build muscle,” she said. “We also want to set our managers and our teams up for success.”
Killius added that it is the first time that a Bay agreement has called for measurable improvements in water quality, rather than basing the goal on estimated reductions in nutrient pollution.
In its statement, the EPA’s Region 3 office also defended the way the revisions were written with regard to the TMDL, arguing that the document “provides specific targets that will be developed and a timeline to achieve the new targets,” and further information will come from the new computer model.
Killius said that the team reviewing the comments also heard “loud and clear,” the numerous requests for a consistent timeline, instead of myriad target dates, including 2030, 2035 and 2040.

The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, among the largest bay nonprofits, is pushing for the entire agreement to have a deadline of 2035, said Keisha Sedlacek, federal director for the foundation.
The document released for public comment also included a number of blanks, in the place of more specific numerical goals for forest and wetland conservation, among other subjects.
“That’s unacceptable. We can’t ask our governors, the mayor of D.C. and the executive director of the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], to sign a document not knowing what exactly they’re committing to. That’s not fair to the states and jurisdictions. It’s not fair to the public,” Sedlacek said.
In its comment letter, the EPA targeted those passages for removal, writing: “It is EPA’s position that these outcomes/targets lack sufficient detail, are not ready for inclusion in the Agreement at this time, and that the targets should be removed,” read the letter from Lee McDonnell, acting director of the Chesapeake Bay Program office.
The Bay Program also has some soul-searching to do about how low — or high — to set its aspirations, environmental advocates say.
“It just seemed like [they were] trying to set these targets in a way that 10,15, years from now, we can say: ‘Oh, look, we achieved this goal,’” said Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, which represents more than 300 environmental organizations in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.
“We don’t want to lower the bar just to have success,” Reilly said.



Tribes rebuffed in their effort to get a seat at the table
It isn’t just the terms of the new Bay agreement that are stirring debate — it’s the people who have a seat at the table.
The Indigenous Conservation Council, a group formed in 2022 that includes the seven federally recognized Native American tribes in Virginia, says tribal governments should also be signatories to the agreement. But their request was rebuffed by the Bay Program, said Melissa Ann Ehrenreich, the council’s executive director.
In a June 27 letter, the Bay Program principal’s staff committee said it respected the tribes’ role as sovereign entities, but it was only tasked with revising the Bay agreement, and that adding a signatory would be “outside of our current charge.” It pledged to take the issue to the governors of the Bay states, via the Bay Program’s executive council, for consideration.
“We felt like it was an unnecessary barrier,” Ehrenreich said.
Several groups, including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Choose Clean Water Coalition, supported the ICC’s request.
Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission and a member of the principal’s staff committee, said the committee’s hands were tied. But they fully expect to recommend that the tribes are considered for potential inclusion in the future.

But the delay is still frustrating for the tribes, who say their inclusion should be a no-brainer, and would bring increased knowledge of Native conservation practices to the bay restoration effort.

(Courtesy of the University of South Dakota)A program supporting rural and first-generation college students pursuing graduate degrees in biomedical research at the University of South Dakota is among the victims of Trump administration grant cancellations upheld recently by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The court ruled last month that $783 million in nationwide research grants related to health disparities, LGBTQ+ health and vaccines could be terminated by the National Institutes of Health. The Trump administration canceled the grants as part of a crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion-related studies.


Federal fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


The federal government awarded USD $1.1 million over the last five years to start a Graduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement, or G-RISE, program. The university had spent all but $174,661 of the money when the grant was terminated.
University officials had hoped to get a “no-cost extension” to spend the remaining funds for a year beyond the grant deadline, said USD spokesperson Alissa Matt.
The program focused on recruiting and retaining underrepresented students to pursue graduate degrees through the USD Division of Biomedical and Translational Science, Matt added. Associate Professor Lisa McFadden said the program looked for students “eager” to become researchers and enrolled applicants based on academic performance, research potential and commitment to the field.
Several other universities throughout the country have G-RISE programs.
“We were also excited about the chance to use this funding to support first-generation and rural students — two of the groups NIH identified as underrepresented in its initial request for proposals,” Matt said in an emailed statement.
Since 2020, the program financially supported 11 graduate students with stipends. Most of the program’s professional development, mentoring and research activities were open to all USD graduate students.
U.S. Supreme Court gives go-ahead for Trump to cancel $783M in NIH research grants

McFadden said in an emailed statement that students in the program are resilient, creative and determined, “often coming from rural communities where resources are limited, yet proving they can thrive in biomedical research.”
“Their success reflects the values of South Dakota: resilience, resourcefulness, and the ability to do more with fewer NIH resources,” McFadden said.
The program was a “strong fit” for USD, Matt said, because it connected students with meaningful training experiences and improved student outcomes. That included increasing the number of fellowships Biomedical and Translational Science graduates received and an increase in publications per student. The program improved retention, with 100% of G-RISE fellows completing the program, and decreased the time it took an average student to graduate.
The university wants to continue the program, so officials are “exploring other grant programs” to support graduate students, Matt said, including applying for other National Institutes of Health grants.
Programs like G-RISE and other projects committed to supporting South Dakota students, McFadden said, “can help South Dakota retain and grow the biomedical workforce our state needs.”

(File Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)With North Carolina lawmakers still negotiating the state budget, a public forum on Thursday highlighted the state’s long-running Leandro case, a nearly three-decade legal battle over equitable education funding.
Speaking at the forum organized by the advocacy group Public Schools First NC, state Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls discussed the history of the case, which began in 1994 when parents and school districts in low-wealth counties sued the state. They argued their students were being denied the state constitution’s guarantee of a “sound basic education.”
The state Supreme Court affirmed that right in 1997 and found that North Carolina had failed to meet its obligation, particularly for at-risk students. Since then, the case has moved through years of court rulings, compliance hearings, and disputes over funding plans.
Earls, who was elected to the state’s highest court in 2018, told the audience she could only discuss the case’s public record, not ongoing proceedings. She read directly from her dissent in a 2022 decision, where she criticized the court’s majority for stepping back from ordering the state to fund a comprehensive remedial plan.
“Not only is it true that justice delayed is justice denied, but denying adequate educational opportunities entails enormous losses, both in dollars and in human potential to the state and its citizens,” Earls read from her dissent. “If our court cannot or will not enforce state constitutional rights, those rights do not exist. The constitution is not worth the paper it is written on, and our oath as judicial officers to uphold the Constitution is a meaningless charade.”
The General Assembly adjourned in late July with no comprehensive deal on the two-year spending plan, passing a resolution to meet only one day a month until the 2026 short session begins in April. Lawmakers have been deadlocked since early summer over tax cuts and spending priorities. That  means months could pass before school districts have clarity on the state’s spending priorities for education.   
Democratic leaders in the legislature and education groups have called on lawmakers to return to Raleigh to pass a full budget. They argue the state needs more than incremental fixes to address increasing enrollment, aging school facilities, and teacher workforce challenges. 
The audience on Thursday also heard from education advocates who connected the case to current classroom struggles. Public Schools First NC have highlighted how Leandro funding could expand pre-K programs, hire more teachers and reduce class sizes.
The Leandro case remains pending before the state Supreme Court, which last heard arguments in February 2024.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P7262843-1536x1152-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-13 07:56:51.903823

Ford",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/09/13/harris-says-fema-should-not-be-states-first-resort-deadlines-are-different-for-senators-more-notes/,"Andy Harris thinks the state should take care of its own before going to FEMA for disaster aid for Western Maryland, deadlines are different for members of Congress, judicial appointments, more in political notes.","Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), chair of the House Freedom Caucus, speaking this week outside the Maryland State House. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) has appealed the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s denial of nearly $34 million in disaster relief to help Western Maryland areas recovering from a devastating flood earlier this year. Maryland’s sole Republican member of Congress said Moore should look to his own budget before appealing to the federal government for help.
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) told Maryland Matters that the flooding is “a tragedy,” but said federal aid was not warranted in this instance.
“Federal emergency aid really should be for very, very large disasters that states can’t afford to cover on their own,” Harris, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, said this week. “The governor just raised taxes $1.6 billion. He probably could find $30 million to send out to Western Maryland.”
“Extreme rainfall” from May 12-14 led to flooding that inundated parts of Allegany and Garrett counties. Midland, Lonaconing and Westernport in Allegany County were among the hardest-hit communities, with floodwaters inundating homes, schools and businesses, washing out roads and damaging pipelines.
The affected counties are all rural, majority Republican and economically challenged areas of the state. The 17.2% poverty rate in Allegany County trails only Baltimore City and Somerset County, both at 20.1%, according to 2023 estimates in the Maryland Manual online. Maryland’s overall poverty rate is 11.1%.
President Donald Trump (R) has called FEMA “a disaster” and said states should handle disaster recovery with the federal government reimbursing some of the costs.
The comments made Monday appear to represent a reversal for Harris, who three weeks ago joined the other nine members of the state’s congressional delegation, all Democrats, asking Trump to approve the aid request.
Cost of Western Maryland flood damage more than doubles; state to appeal FEMA aid denial

“We appreciate the congressman’s stated support for getting the FEMA funding that Western Maryland deserves,” Maureen Regan, a Moore spokesperson, said in a statement responding to Harris’ latest comments. “FEMA funding will be a critical boost to the nearly $1.5 million in disaster recovery and energy assistance that the state has already provided. We just hope the president will listen to the pleas of Mountain Marylanders to help rebuild their towns.”
Deadline? What’s that?
There are many words to describe the letter from 23 members of Congress to the Executive Council of the Chesapeake Bay Program regarding the latest multiyear proposal to clean up the bay: Thoughtful; bipartisan; forceful; forward-looking; thorough.
Late.
The letter is dated Sept. 11, even though the official public comment period for the “Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement Beyond 2025 Revision Draft” closed on Sept. 1, ending a 90-day comment period. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said “our goal was to get it in” by the deadline, but apparently it takes awhile to get 23 House and Senate members in line.
The letter is generally appreciative of the work the Bay Program has done to prepare the document, but says it needs more specifics, and it needs to be written in plain language that regular folks understand. And it says the plan needs to be both broad-based to cover all the challenges the bay currently faces, but also flexible enough to meet challenges that can’t be predicted yet, as new environmental problems crop up.
The letter is signed by eight senators including Van Hollen, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and 15 House members, including six Maryland Democrats: Reps. Kweisi Mfume, Steny Hoyer, Glenn Ivey, Sarah Elfreth, Johnny Olszewski, and April McClain Delaney. All 23 signers are from states in the bay watershed.
Despite the date, Van Hollen’s not too worried about the work behind the letter going to waste.
“From our perspective, we believe that when you’ve got this many members of Congress on a bipartisan basis weighing in that, you know, we expect these views to be taken into account,” he said.
Leave her alone
That was the thrust of an open letter from Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown and 20 other Democratic attorneys general to the U.S. Justice Department recently over its investigation of New York Attorney General Letitia James (D).
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter accuses the department of “pursuing a pattern of harassment and intimidation” after James won financial fraud lawsuit against President Donald Trump (R), then a private citizen. Trump has appealed the ruling that ordered him to pay about a half-billion dollars against him. That award has since been rejected as excessive by a New York state appellate court, which otherwise upheld the ruling against him.
In February 2025, just weeks after Trump was sworn in to his second term in office, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed a “weaponization working group” to investigate “all departments or agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority of the United States over the last four years.” Specifically it was directed to investigate James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Special Counsel Jack Smith, all of whom investigated Trump, prosecution of Jan. 6 riot defendants and prosecution of people for blocking access to abortion clinics, among other targets.
“Every aspect of the Department’s campaign against AG James makes plain that it is not rooted in any legitimate suspicion of wrongdoing: President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi are both on record having made public threats against AG James,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote.
The letter also criticizes Edward Martin Jr., a Trump loyalist heading the Justice Department’s working group, pointing to a “crude letter” Martin wrote to James’ personal attorney, caling for her to resign, and later showing up at James’ home to pose for press photographs, according to video obtained by CNN.
“Mr. Martin’s antics and actions amount more to those of a showman than to those of a representative of the United States government charged with ensuring that impartiality, integrity, and fairness are the cornerstones of criminal investigation and enforcement,” the attorneys general wrote.
A representative with the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other attorneys general who signed the letter are from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
When being called bench-warmer is a good thing
Gov. Wes Moore this week tapped “two remarkable servants of the law” to fill vacancies on two circuit court benches, with James J. Dietrich appointed in Montgomery County and Kristina L. Watkowski in Worcester County.
“Throughout their legal careers, James Dietrich and Kristina Watkowski have demonstrated an unwavering dedication to integrity and justice that will serve the people of Maryland well for years to come,” Moore said in a statement Wednesday announcing the appointments.
Dietrich has spent close to 30 years as a prosecutor, beginning his career in the Howard County State’s Attorney’s office, where he served for 21 years and was part of the circuit court trial team for 10 years, and for the last seven years he has been a prosecutor with the Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s Office, serving on the major crimes and post-conviction units.
Dietrich teaches coursed on evidence, criminal procedure and trial practice as an adjunct professor at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law, where he received his law degree. He earned his bachelor’s degree from Lemoyne College.
Watkowski began her legal career clerking for Judges Theodore R. Eschenburg Sr. and Thomas C. Groton III in Worcester County Circuit Court, before moving to the Maryland Office of the Public Defender where she eventually became supervising attorney for the Worcester County office. Since 2022, she has worked as an attorney with Booth, Cropper & Marriner since 2022, with a practice primarily focused on civil litigation with a concentration in land use and zoning.
Watkowski earned an associate’s degree from Howard Community College and her bachelor’s degree from Salisbury University, before getting her law degree at Widener University’s Delaware Law School.

Steny Hoyer's (D-5th) Women's Equality Day Luncheon in College Park. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Whenever Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) walks into a room, he’s usually greeted with hugs, handshakes, kisses on the cheek and gratitude for his more than 40 years in Congress.
But one longtime colleague stood out when she offered those same accolades Friday during the congressman’s 23rd annual Women’s Equality Day Luncheon in College Park attended by a few hundred people.
“Thank all of you for being here and supporting Steny Hoyer over the years,” said former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D-Calif.), who served as keynote speaker at the event. “When I talk about things that relate to women in the world … [and] having fairness in our society, we can be sure that Steny will be on the forefront.”
Without mentioning President Donald Trump (R) and other Republican leaders by name, Pelosi said there’s been efforts to restrict the women’s right to choose and to appoint women to leadership positions.
“Know that there’s nothing more wholesome for our country, whether it’s in politics and government, whether it’s in the academic world, whether it’s in the military, nothing is more enhanced than by the increased leadership and participation of women,” Pelosi said. “When women succeed, America succeeds.”
Women’s Equality Day is celebrated Aug. 26, to commemorate the 19th Amendment that granted women the right to vote and was ratified in 1920.

Hoyer has three daughters and two of his three grandchildren and three of his four great grandchildren are females. After the death of his first wife, Judy Pickett Hoyer, he remarried two years ago to Elaine Kamarck.
“I have been blessed with a lot of women in my life,” Hoyer said to some laughs and applause in the audience.
Hoyer, who turned 86 on June 14, and Pelosi, 85, have served in Congress together since the 1980s, but have known each other even longer, briefly working together in the early 1960s for U.S. Sen. Daniel Brewster (D-Md.). So when Hoyer makes an appearance these days, he is inevitably asked whether he plans to seek a to 24th term in Congress next year.
“We’re thinking about it,” Hoyer said in a brief interview after the luncheon. “I’m in this fight. This is a fight that is worth having. What is being done in Washington is making America less fair, [there’s] less investment in our future. I’m very concerned about it.”
But those concerns stop at violence, said Hoyer, reflecting on Wednesday’s shooting death of 31-year-old conservative activist, Charlie Kirk during an event at Utah Valley State University.
“We know that there are people who think violence is an alternative — violence is an alternative that will cause chaos and death and diminish our democracy,” Hoyer said. “We need every one of us [to] reject the use of violence, particularly when it comes to political speech. Our democracy believes that debate resolves our differences, not violence.”
In the wake of Kirk’s death, bomb threats were made Thursday to Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) and several historically Black colleges and universities. On the same day, the U.S. Naval Academy was locked down after false reports of a gunman on campus led to the accidental shooting of a midshipman. Morgan State University said Friday that it received a bomb threat, that it determined was not credible, but still informed the FBI “out of abundant caution.”
Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) — who once. interned for Hoyer — attended Friday’s luncheon and also reflected on the recent events, including a school shooting Wednesday in Colorado.
“I don’t want to keep going down this course, and I just ask everybody to reflect on this moment and the choice that we have here,” said Elfreth, who plans to go forward with an open telephone town hall Monday that was scheduled before the Kirk shooting. “The only way to get through this is to recognize that we all have a part to play in fixing this.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nancy-Pelosi-9-12-2025-1024x927.jpg,,,2025-09-13 08:57:42.175474

It's considered the oldest Jewish synagogue, in continuous usage, west of the Mississippi River. (Marty Nelson/Getty Images)In May 1949, more than 150 people crowded into a modest new synagogue on Bannock Street in Boise. They came not only from the small Jewish community, but also from churches across the city. 
Leaders in attendance included the Rev. Hartzell Cobbs of First Christian Church, the Rev. Herald Gardner of St. Michael’s Episcopal, the Rev. Ray Dunn of First Methodist, the Rev. Robert Ray of First Baptist, Jesse McQueen representing the Latter-day Saints, and Chaplain L. W. Backman of the Idaho State Prison.
The Rev. Cobbs, then president of the Boise Ministerial Association, prayed that the new temple would receive “the highest blessing of the Lord” as its members worked in the “service of God.” It was, as the Idaho Statesman reported at the time, “a milestone in the adventure in faith.”
That milestone is worth remembering. It reminds us that interfaith solidarity is not new to Idaho — it is part of the state’s history.
The Jewish community that built Temple Ahavath Israel in 1949 was small, just twenty members. Yet with donations of money, materials, and labor — from Jews and non-Jews alike — they raised $10,000 to complete Boise’s second synagogue. The achievement earned national recognition in the United Synagogue Review in New York, which praised Boise’s example.
This was not the first time Jewish life in Idaho was publicly noted. As early as 1892, the Statesman reported that Jewish-owned businesses across Boise closed for Yom Kippur, and seventy-five Jews gathered in the Odd Fellows Hall to pray. Three years later, when Congregation Beth Israel incorporated, one of its leaders was Moses Alexander, who would later become governor of Idaho and the first practicing Jewish governor in the United States. That same year, a rabbi addressed the Methodist Episcopal Church in Boise — a conversation grounded in fellowship across traditions.
On Aug. 30, 1896, Beth Israel, Idaho’s first synagogue, was dedicated at State and Eleventh. Shortly after, the Statesman advertised the High Holiday services, treating Jewish observance as part of the city’s public fabric.
During World War II, when Ahavath Israel began holding services for Jewish servicemen stationed at Gowen Field and Mountain Home Air Base, space quickly grew tight. The congregation turned to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which hosted Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services in its downtown chapel.
The pattern repeated again in 1961 in Pocatello, where the whole community laid the cornerstone for Temple Emanuel. City officials, the chairman of the Pocatello Ministerial Association, and the mayor of Alameda all attended. One speaker urged that instead of “bigger armies and more destructive weapons,” humanity would be better served by building houses of worship.
These stories show something consistent about Idaho. Time and again, small Jewish communities were met with open doors. Protestant clergy, LDS leaders, and elected officials alike showed up not only in times of crisis but in moments of celebration.
Today, when headlines about antisemitism, civil division, and xenophobia dominate national news, it is easy to forget that pluralism is not new. Idaho’s history offers powerful lessons for our country now. For generations, Idahoans have known something that still matters: showing up for others across difference, working together even while disagreeing about important questions, doesn’t weaken a community’s identity — it strengthens it.
The dedication of a synagogue was not only a Jewish event, but an Idaho event.
Seventy-six years after that day in 1949, it is worth asking: What would it look like to show up for one another across lines of difference today? What can we still learn from the spirit that led Protestants, Latter-day Saints and Jews to stand together on Bannock Street, offering shared blessings for a new sacred space?
It’s not nostalgia — it’s a legacy worth carrying forward.

Dec. 7, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska-Lincoln administrators mapped out $27.5 million in proposed cuts that faculty say will be “devastating” to a campus that has already endured $75 million in cuts over the past six years.
UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett detailed the cuts Friday, including $7.7 million from eliminating six degree programs, $5.5 million expected from buyouts for long-term tenured faculty, $4.6 million from a 1% reduction in state-aided budgets, $3.8 million in “efficiencies” from top administrative offices and four colleges, $2 million from merging four academic departments into two schools and $550,000 less for graduate assistantships.
The plan also seeks “targeted philanthropy” to backfill $2.5 million in mandated tuition remissions, a goal the university hopes to address over the long-term with state lawmakers.
‘An awful day’
John Shrader, president of UNL’s Faculty Senate, said the timeline to offer feedback on the cuts, by Oct. 10, is tight, and he said the damage could take years for the university to repair, “if ever.”
“The professors and the Extension and staff and students have not caused a $27.5 million deficit, but we’re paying for it,” Shrader told the Nebraska Examiner. “We’re the ones who are going to be deeply impacted.”
He added: “It’s just an awful day for the University of Nebraska, no matter how you look at it.”

Jessie Brophy, president of the UNL Staff Senate and director of external engagement and partnerships at the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, said that while the Staff Senate recognizes the need for the reductions, staff are deeply concerned about the impact.
“We are committed to representing staff perspectives, supporting our colleagues, and maintaining open communication as the process moves forward,” Brophy said in a statement.
Student leaders for the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska and Graduate Student Assembly did not immediately respond to requests Friday for comment.
Proposed cuts
The academic programs proposed for elimination are:

Department of Educational Administration ($1.95 million, 17 positions)
Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ($1.85 million, 12 positions)
Department of Statistics ($1.75 million, 12 positions)
Department of Textiles, Merchandising and Fashion Design ($1.45 million, 11 positions)
Community and Regional Planning degree programs ($475,000, four positions)
Landscape Architecture degree programs ($225,000, two positions)

In the case of the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, which includes geology and meteorology and climatology, “high-performing faculty” may qualify for rehire in other UNL units “to preserve educational pathways and research expertise.”
The Department of Statistics is a stand-alone department. Undergraduate data science degrees in the College of Arts and Sciences and College of Engineering would be retained.
The Departments of Entomology and Plant Pathology would be merged under the proposal, as would the Departments of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication (ALEC). If approved, faculty from the two units would devise a combined name and plan in the spring.
Additionally, there would be fewer graduate assistantships available in the College of Arts and Sciences ($325,000) and College of Engineering ($225,000).

University officials, keeping in line with a promise by NU President Jeffrey Gold, vowed that any students in eliminated programs — freshman or otherwise — would be able to complete their degrees, though making it happen might require compressed timelines or program modifications.
The cuts also would eliminate the remaining $850,000 in state-aided funding for UNL’s Office of Student Life, which a UNL spokesperson said would likely include a mix of programmatic reductions, operational efficiencies and salary impacts. That total is less than 1% of the office’s total budget, which includes student fees, housing and dining.
The Colleges of Business, Engineering, Fine and Performing Arts and Journalism and Mass Communications would need to find a combined $1.1 million in administrative and staff “efficiencies.” 
Bennett’s office, as well as the top academic office and business and finance division, would need to find $2.69 million in unidentified “efficiencies.”
An eye toward ‘efficiencies’
While it’s unclear what these “efficiencies” might look like, some deans have previewed the efforts.


UNL budget reduction proposal
$7.7 million, academic program eliminations
$5.5 million, buyout program for tenured faculty (anticipated savings)
$4.61 million, reducing all state-aided budgets by about 1%
$2.69 million, executive administrative and staff “efficiencies”
$2.5 million, unfunded tuition waivers covered with “targeted philanthropy”
$2 million, department realignments/mergers
$1.1 million, administrative and staff “efficiencies” across four colleges
$850,000, reductions to the Student Life division
$550,000, fewer graduate assistantships in College of Arts and Sciences and College of Engineering


Dean Shari Veil of the College of Journalism told her college that the “efficiencies” will mean fewer electives, some larger class sizes and additional course sections more dependent on demand and waitlists that might determine whether to offer more sections of courses.
While the journalism college faced no proposals to eliminate majors, Veil said the college will still look at revising its curriculum for “stronger connections” across majors and new courses.
“None of these changes will alter our core mission: to nurture curious and creative minds to thrive in the ever-changing media and communication professions,” Veil said in an email Friday.
Dean Andrew Belser of the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts told faculty and staff something Bennett’s announcement did not: that his college will look at combining its two performing arts schools — the Glenn Korff School of Music and Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film — to work more collaboratively under a shared director.
Belser said the reorganization brings new opportunities and the ability to “open the door to exciting new collaborations,” such as joint projects, shared production support and faster integration of emerging media arts.
“While this reorganization is, in part, a necessary response to budgetary realities, it is designed to make our college stronger and help us better prepare students for the 21st-century creative workforce they are entering,” Belser wrote.
Long-term fix sought
Bennett, in a video message Friday to the campus, said that while UNL and the broader NU system offer a significant return on investment — estimated at $10 for every $1 — UNL has faced declining revenues. That includes net tuition, fewer state funds than anticipated and sharply rising costs for utilities, health care, property and liability insurance.
He said UNL’s structural deficit has “compounded over time” with the latest plan meant to “help safeguard against repetitive budget reduction cycles” by eliminating the $21 million deficit but also finding $6.5 million more to trim.

Leslie Reed, UNL’s public affairs director, described the additional cuts as “proactive reductions to better position UNL for the future, so it can break out of this cycle of budget cutting.”
“I am hopeful this work will allow UNL more time to implement long-term strategies for financial sustainability,” Bennett said.
Reed said she was unaware how much of UNL’s cuts are meant to help NU with a systemwide $20 million deficit, which Gold has acknowledged would prove “incredibly painful.”
Since late June 2020, UNL has weathered $75 million in cuts. Bennett joined UNL in July 2023.
Bennett said he appreciates the “sacrifices” many UNL community members have made, including repeatedly being asked to do more with less, which he acknowledged is unsustainable. But the chancellor, whose contract is currently slated to expire at the end of this fiscal year, said now is the time “to boldly reimagine our future.”
Future investment
Top campus leaders evaluated programs and campus areas on quantitative and qualitative data, Bennett said. A university website says the data included program strengths, state needs and workforce alignment.

The metrics also had an eye toward a long-term goal to have UNL rejoin the prestigious Association of American Universities, Shrader said. UNL was voted out in 2011 after 100 years as a member.
The AAU particularly praises research and research funding, with campus leaders looking at awards, book publications, citations, unit growth and more.
Shrader, an associate professor in broadcasting and sports media and communications who joined UNL in 2017 said he worries for students and noted that while state leaders repeatedly say they want a Big Ten, Research 1 (R1), first-class university, investments have lagged behind, sometimes at the level of “uninvestment” or disinvestment, he explained.
“We need investment to make this a first-class university, and every year we don’t do that, we slip a little farther behind,” Shrader said.
Executive, legislative fights
Part of the budget deficit for NU as a whole also comes as state appropriations have slowed under Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, who took office in 2023 after serving as an NU regent for a decade.
Pillen has been harder on his alma mater, proposing this January to cut NU’s budget by 2% in the first year of a two-year budget cycle. The NU Board of Regents had requested a 3.5% budget increase in each of the two fiscal years.

In the end, negotiations between Gold and Pillen and legislative will landed at a smaller 0.625% increase this current fiscal year and a 1.25% increase on top of that slower-growing total the following year.
Reed did not answer a reporter’s question on what steps Bennett has taken to engage with state leaders or philanthropic donors, endeavors Gold has been more public about. 
Bennett told the Examiner in 2023 he had been accustomed to being at the Mississippi Capitol about three days a week during its legislative session while he led the University of Southern Mississippi. He had suggested he would do the same in Lincoln.
Reed did not directly answer the Examiner’s question of whether Bennett would seek a contract extension before his contract expires June 30. She said Bennett is committed to leading UNL “toward new levels of excellence well into the future.”
“He expects to continue to serve as long as he is called upon,” Reed said.
‘Long-term consequences’
Sarah Zuckerman, an associate professor of education administration and president of the UNL chapter of the American Association of University Professors, urged campus leaders and regents to reject Bennett’s plan, which she called “extremely short-sighted.”
“They don’t take into account the long-term consequences of closing programs and letting faculty go who are uniquely valuable to the state of Nebraska,” Zuckerman said.

Many faculty speaking to the Examiner also questioned what happens if fewer than expected tenured faculty take the voluntary separation package. Faculty aged 62 or older who have been with NU for at least 10 are eligible. The deadline to apply is Sept. 30.
Most faculty and staff received no pay increases this year due to budget cuts and because UNL has no employee unions, unlike faculty in Omaha and Kearney.
‘Set the stage’
Bennett encouraged the UNL community to offer feedback on the budget reduction plan to UNL’s Academic Planning Committee, an internal working group that includes faculty, staff and students. Feedback is due Oct. 10 and is expected to include public hearings.
The chair of that committee declined to comment Friday and directed questions to Reed.
“We have the opportunity to set the stage for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s next 155 years, and your voice in shaping our future matters,” Bennett said.
Shrader said that while UNL is not a big university, it has a “nice, hard-working community here that impacts the State of Nebraska as much as or more than any other institution in the state.”
“When you do things like this, it can be nothing but detrimental to all of us,” Shrader said. “It can be nothing but a negative impact on every single one of us.”

(Vinegar Syndrome/Roe Bressan/Frameline Distribution)First it was referred to as a “mysterious illness.” Later it was called “gay cancer,” “gay plague” and “GRID,” an acronym for gay-related immune deficiency. Most egregiously, some called it “4H disease” — shorthand for “homosexuals, heroin addicts, hemophiliacs and Haitians,” the populations most afflicted in the early days.
While these names were ultimately replaced by AIDS — and later, after the virus was identified, by HIV — they reflected two key realities about AIDS at the time: a lack of understanding about the disease and its strong association with gay men.
Although the first report in the mainstream press about AIDS appeared in 1981, the first movies to explore the disease wouldn’t come for four more years.
When the feature film “Buddies” and the television film “An Early Frost” premiered 40 years ago, in the fall of 1985, AIDS had belatedly been breaking into the public consciousness.
Earlier that year, the first off-Broadway plays about AIDS opened: “As Is” by William Hoffman and “The Normal Heart” by writer and activist Larry Kramer. That summer, actor Rock Hudson disclosed that he had AIDS, becoming the first major celebrity to do so. Hudson, who died in October 1985, was a friend of President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan. Reagan, who had been noticeably silent on the subject of the disease, would go on to make his first — albeit brief — public remarks about AIDS in September 1985.
Five days before Reagan’s speech, “Buddies,” an independent film made for US$27,000 and shot in nine days, premiered at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco on Sept. 12, 1985.
 
A film on the front lines
If you haven’t heard of “Buddies,” that’s not surprising; the film mostly played art houses and festivals before disappearing.
Its filmmaker, Arthur J. Bressan Jr., was best known for his gay pornographic films, although he’d also made documentaries such as “Gay USA.” “Buddies” would go on to reach a wider audience thanks to a 2018 video release by Vinegar Syndrome, a distribution company that focuses on restoring cult cinema, exploitation films and other obscure titles.
It was inspired by the real-life buddies program at the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, an organization Kramer co-founded. At the time, many people dying of the disease had been rejected by family and friends, so a buddy might be the only person who visited a terminal AIDS patient.
The film feels like a play, in that most of the movie takes place in a single room and features just two characters: a naive young gay man named David and a young AIDS patient named Robert. Over the course of the film, the characters open up about their lives and their fears about the growing epidemic. It also includes a sex scene — something other early AIDS films completely avoided — in which David and Robert engage in safer sex.
 
AIDS packaged for the masses
The remarkably frank and intimate approach to the epidemic in “Buddies” contrasts sharply to the television film “An Early Frost,” which premiered on NBC on Nov. 11, 1985.
The film’s protagonist is a successful Chicago lawyer named Michael who hasn’t come out to his family, much to the distress of his long-term partner, Peter. When Michael finds out he has AIDS, he’s forced to come out to his parents, both as gay and as having AIDS.
Much of the film deals with Michael’s self-acceptance and his attempts to mend his relationships. Yet the production of “An Early Frost” was fraught with concerns about depicting both homosexuality and AIDS. Unlike David and Robert, Michael and Peter show no physical affection — they barely touch each other.


Knowledge of AIDS was still evolving — a test for HIV was approved in March 1985 — so screenwriters and life partners Daniel Lipman and Ron Cowen went through 13 revisions of the script. The real-life fears and misconceptions about how AIDS could and could not be transmitted were central to the storyline, adding extra pressure to be accurate in the face of evolving understanding of the virus.
Despite losing NBC $500,000 in advertisers, “An Early Frost” drew 34 million viewers and was showered with Emmy nominations the following year.
 
A quilt of stories emerges
“Buddies” and “An Early Frost” opened up AIDS and HIV as subject matters for film and television.
They begat two lanes of HIV storytelling that continue to this day.
The first is an approach geared to mainstream audiences that tends to avoid controversial issues such as sex or religion and instead focuses on characters who grapple with both the illness and the stigma of the virus.
The second is an indie approach that’s often more confrontational, irreverent and angry at the injustice and indifference AIDS patients faced.
The former approach is seen in 1993’s “Philadelphia,” which earned Tom Hanks his first Oscar. The critically and commercially successful film shares a number of story points with “An Early Frost”: Hanks’ character, a big-city lawyer, finds out he is HIV positive and must confront bias head-on. HIV also features prominently in later films such as “Precious” (2009) and “Dallas Buyers Club” (2013), both of which, like “Philadelphia,” became awards darlings.
The edgier, more critical approach can be seen in the New Queer Cinema movement of the 1990s, a film movement that developed as a response to the epidemic. Gregg Araki’s “The Living End” (1992) is a key film in the movement: It tells the story of two HIV-positive men who become pseudo-vigilantes in the wake of their diagnoses.

Somewhere in between is “Longtime Companion” (1990), which was the first film about AIDS to receive a wide release and tracks the impact of the epidemic on a fictional group of gay men throughout the 1980s. The film was written by gay playwright and screenwriter Craig Lucas and directed by Norman Rene, who died of AIDS six years after the film’s release.
 
Studios still leery
In many ways, television is where the real breakthroughs have happened and continue to happen.
The first television episode to deal with AIDS appeared on the medical drama “St. Elsewhere” in 1983; AIDS was also the subject of episodes in the sitcoms “Mr. Belvedere,” “The Golden Girls” and “Designing Women.” “Killing All the Right People” was the title of the latter’s special episode — a phrase the show’s writer and co-creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason heard while her mother was being treated for AIDS.
More recently, producer Ryan Murphy has made a cottage industry of representations of queer people, particularly those with HIV. His stage revivals of “The Normal Heart” and Mart Crowley’s 1968 play “The Boys in the Band” were later adapted into films for television and streaming. He also produced “Pose,” a three-season series about drag ball culture in the 1980s that stars queer characters of color, several of whom are HIV positive.
Yet for all of these strides, representations of HIV in film are still hard to come by. In fact, out of the 256 films released by major distributors in 2024, the number of HIV-positive characters amounted to … zero.
Perhaps movie studios are less willing to risk even a character with HIV given the drop in movie theater attendance in the age of streaming.
If you think it’s an exaggeration to suggest that people might not want to be seen going to the theater to watch a film about characters with HIV, the results of a 2021 GLAAD survey may surprise you.
It found that the stigma around HIV is still very high, particularly for HIV-positive people working in schools and hospitals. One-third of respondents were unaware that medication is available to prevent the transmission of HIV. More than half didn’t know that HIV-positive people can reach undetectable status and not transmit the virus to others.
Another important finding from the survey: Only about half of the nonqueer respondents had seen a TV show or film about someone with HIV.
This reflects both the progress made since “Buddies” and “An Early Frost” and also why these films still matter today. They were released at a time when there was almost no cultural representation of HIV, and misinformation and disinformation were rampant. There have been so many advances, in both the treatment of HIV and its visibility in popular culture. That visibility still matters, because there’s still much more than can be done to end the stigma.

(Getty Images)Health insurance rates will increase sharply for the 4 million-plus Floridians who rely on so-called Obamacare plans or small employer health insurance coverage in the coming weeks, according to data released by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.
The OIR reported late last month that, beginning Jan. 1, 2026,  Florida health plans had been approved for double-digit increases in monthly premiums people pay for the individual policies sold on the federal health insurance exchange (healthcare.gov). Florida leads the nation in the number of people enrolled in the exchange.

A 28-year old adult living in Duval County earning $35,000 annually and enrolled in a silver-level individual health insurance plan may pay $281 a month starting Jan. 1, up from $149 now.
Premiums for a family of four earning $85,000 in Duval County will increase to $864 a month after tax credits in 2026, up from $558.
A 28-year-old- living in Miami-Dade County could pay a $322 monthly premium; premiums for such a person in Hillsborough County could total $298 a month. Family premiums in those counties will be $1,019 a month and $932 a month, respectively.
Rates in rural counties will be even higher. Okeechobee County has the dubious distinction of facing the highest premiums in the state: A family of four could pay $1,630 a month and an individual $484 a month.

The OIR posted the information “for illustrative purposes only” on Aug. 25 but did not otherwise publicly announce that it was available online for people to review in advance of open enrollment for 2026 coverage, which starts Nov. 1.
“Posting them on our website is making them public,” OIR spokesperson Kylie Mason told the Florida Phoenix in an email.
The increases in the costs of coverage — coupled with reductions to Medicaid in the 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act (also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill) and programmatic changes to the ACA  — could increase the number of uninsured residents in the state by as many as 730,000 in the next 10 years, a KFF analysis shows. 
Most of those people, 500,000, could become uninsured because of changes to Obamacare — formally the Affordable Care Act (ACA) — and the elimination of enhanced advanced premiums tax credits first made available in 2021 to further lower out-of-pocket costs for people in “silver” level plans.
If the enhanced advance premium tax credits expire, the number of uninsured residents in Florida could increase by another 1.2 million people, the same KFF analysis indicates. Those additional tax payments for co-payments and deductibles are set to expire at the end of the year. The Florida Hospital Association and other organizations want Congress to extend them.
“We’re approaching a healthcare cliff right now,” Florida Decides Healthcare spokesperson Karol Molinares told the Florida Phoenix. The organization is pushing a ballot initiative to place Medicaid expansion before the voters.
“That means ERs being clogged up, people not being able to see their primary-care doctors, uncompensated care. Costs for hospitals are going to skyrocket, which the state is going to be on the hook for. You’re also going to have 50,000 medical jobs that are going to be lost. It’s a whole chain reaction.”
More details
The rate increases affect small-employer coverage, too, because the ACA requires certain benefits and coverage to be included in the health plans small employers offer their staffs.
The rate increases for small businesses aren’t as great as those for individuals and therefore the premium increases aren’t as severe, but remain substantive. The OIR data show costs rising from an average $728 per individual in 2025 to $821 in 2026.
Although Republicans in Florida have not expanded Medicaid to lower-income childless adults, as the ACA allows, the federal health law is popular with residents who annually have flocked to the marketplace for health coverage.
The health exchanges represent a key component of the law, which changed how health insurance can be priced. The law bans insurance companies from medically underwriting the policies and allows rates to be based on four factors only: age, tobacco use, geographic location, and family size. 
Eighteen companies write in the state’s individual health insurance market, including the Community Care Network, a Department of Veterans Affairs health plan providing care outside of VA facilities that operates in Broward County only.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, operating under the Florida Blue moniker, offer policies across Florida’s 67 counties. Its affiliate, Health Options, provides HMO coverage in  64 counties. Centene Venture Co. Florida, meanwhile, is offered in 63 counties.
The OIR released 2026 county breakdowns of potential premiums for a 28-year-old individual earning $35,000 annually and potential premiums for a family of four earning $85,000. (Note: The 2025 county breakdowns showed premiums for individuals earning $34,000 and families of four earning $84,000.)
The OIR examples illustrate the costs of plans as well as costs after the advanced premium tax credits that reduce premiums. The numbers are based on the silver-level health insurance policy, the only plan that qualifies enrollees for additional credits to lower out-of-pocket costs. 
Florida is not alone in these rate hikes — insurers nationwide are filing double-digit increases. A KFF review of marketplace plans submitted by 312 insurers in 50 states and the District of Columbia shows that the median proposed increase for 2026 is 18%, more than double last year’s 7% median proposed increase.
Insurers cited rising costs, utilization of services, and the loss of enhanced advanced premium tax benefits as reasons behind the rate increases, according to KFF.
Medicaid expansion needed
According to the most recent OIR data, most people in Florida who purchased health insurance policies in 2023 bought individual coverage on the federal health insurance exchange.The 2023 data show that more than 5.8 million people maintained commercial health insurance policies, and most of those people, 3.6 million-plus, had individual health insurance. 
Nearly 1.8 million people had large-group plans — those sold to businesses with more than 51 employees. Small group policies insured another 400,164 lives in 2023. 
The soaring rates, Molinares said, underscore the need for Florida to expand Medicaid to low-income, childless adults, Molinares said.
“I think Medicaid expansion is the last tool in the tool box to avoid a healthcare cliff that we are barrelling toward if the ACA tax credits don’t get renewed,” she said.

Ned Lamont’s decision to order flags flown at half-staff in honor of Charlie Kirk is not only baffling —it is a disgrace.
In bestowing one of our state’s most solemn honors on a man whose public life was defined by cruelty, bigotry, and division, Lamont has insulted vast numbers of his own constituents—particularly people of color, women, LGBTQ+ folks, and immigrants—whom Kirk worked tirelessly to marginalize and silence.
Let’s be clear: flying the flag at half-staff is not a trivial gesture. It is a civic ritual meant to honor individuals who have served their country or community with distinction, who have elevated public life, who have helped us move closer to our ideals. It is a symbol of collective mourning for someone we believe made us better.
Charlie Kirk did the opposite. He built a career by inflaming our divisions, trafficking in racist and misogynistic rhetoric, and mocking the very people Connecticut claims to protect. As the founder of Turning Point USA, he led a campaign to harass educators, undermine public institutions, and spread conspiracy theories that corrode democratic trust. He did not serve this nation—he desecrated its promise.
While Lamont referenced President Trump’s proclamation that federal buildings fly flags at half staff in his order to do the same at state buildings, Trump’s proclamation is in no way binding on the state of Connecticut. At least two states, including near neighbors New York and New Jersey, appeared to be flying at full staff on Friday. Others simply extended, without comment, their order to lower flags in honor of the victims of the 9/11 attacks. Others mentioned “victims of political violence,” including  Mellisa Hortman, the Minnesota lawmaker assassinated earlier this year. Lamont’s appears to be a deliberate decision to join Trump in honoring a person at odds with the values of the majority of the people of Connecticut, with no connection to the state.
There is no shortage of community heroes in Connecticut who have spent their lives in service who never received such a gesture. Even just under  Lamont’s tenure, we have lost so many organizers, advocates, legislators, and others who all worked toward building solidarity and improving the lives of the people around them, and they were denied the honor that Lamont is now bestowing on a professional bigot.
Connecticut dignitaries like Martin Luther King Jr. associates Thirman L. Milner and Rev. Robert W. Perry, labor organizer and Connecticut House Minority Leader David Puldin, Common Cause president Karen Hobert Flynn, senior and care workers’ advocate and State Senator Edith Prague, and more have all died in the last several years with no such state honors.
Yet a man who compared the LGBTQ+ community to “a threat to civilization,” who cheered the rollback of women’s rights, who planned a dedicated campaign to chip away at the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., and who applauded political violence now receives state-sanctioned mourning? Why does Kirk, a provocateur with no ties to our state and a legacy of division, deserve more?
Even if Governor Lamont intended this as a gesture of political neutrality, he cannot hide behind decorum when the symbolism is so profoundly wrong. Neutrality in the face of hate is complicity. Mourning Charlie Kirk as a public servant worthy of reverence sends a clear message: that the pain he inflicted is less important than the political convenience of honoring a well-connected figure on the national stage.
This isn’t about partisan politics. It’s about values. It’s about deciding who we lift up, and who we mourn. Should Charlie Kirk have been murdered? No. Should we pretend that he was anything more than the shit-stirrer than he was? Also no. 
Honoring a man like Charlie Kirk with a public display of reverence is a deep betrayal of the communities he harmed —and a troubling sign of whose pain matters to this administration.
Governor Lamont must answer for this choice. And Connecticut residents should demand that our symbols of honor reflect the best of who we are —not the worst of what we’ve allowed.

(Al Persicke / The Reveille) U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Gov. Jeff Landry were among the participants at a vigil LSU held Friday evening for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University. 
The event was organized by the LSU chapter of Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization Kirk founded and built into an immense political force. 
Kirk, 31, was known for holding events at universities across the country where he engaged in debate with students. Though he was successful in mobilizing young people to support conservative causes, Kirk was a controversial figure for his often inflammatory comments about race, sexuality and religion. His events often sparked outrage from students. 
“I think Charlie Kirk contributed more positive contributions to the free marketplace of ideas than anyone in his generation, and probably in many generations,” Johnson said about Kirk, who he described as a close friend. 
Utah Valley University was Kirk’s first stop on what was meant to be a multi-state debating tour that included a stop at LSU on Oct. 27. 
Kirk was shot within minutes of the event starting. His death sparked immediate condemnations of political violence from across the political spectrum, as well as some further polarizing statements from both far-right and far-left corners. 
“It is important to recognize that the very idea of a representative republic is to allow for the free exchange of ideas that can be debated in a peaceful setting, so that we don’t have to fight it out in the street,” Landry said in a post on X in the aftermath of Kirk’s shooting. 
Kirk’s killing also prompted political figures and universities to rethink security measures for public events. LSU’s vigil required security screenings and was staffed by dozens of law enforcement officers from Louisiana State Police, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office, the Baton Rouge Police Department and the LSU Police Department. 
A suspect in Kirk’s death was arrested Friday and charged with aggravated murder, a capital offense in Utah. Authorities say they intend to pursue the death penalty for 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. Little is known about his motivations. 
Savannah Harrison, a Landry aide and former president of LSU’s Turning Point chapter, held back tears while speaking about the impact Kirk had on her life. 
“I was the girl ripping Trump hats off of my classmates’ heads. But through Charlie’s influence, I went from doing that to proudly wearing my own,” Harrison said. “I … embraced the values that still ground me today – God, family, country, and, as Charlie would say, in that order.” 
LSU announced Friday it would launch a lecture series promoting civil engagement and diverse viewpoints in Kirk’s memory. The LSU Foundation is seeking donations to support the series. 
“In the wake of the assassination of American political activist and media personality Charlie Kirk, LSU seeks to be the first university in the country to tangibly re-assert its commitment to civil discourse and freedom of speech,” LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard and interim President Matt Lee said in a joint statement. “LSU has a long history of visible support for free speech … We are therefore well-positioned to take leadership on this front.” 
Lee said he hoped donations would soon come in to support the lecture series but did not know when it would start. 
Some conservatives have sought retribution against those who celebrated Kirk’s death. The Louisiana Republican Party issued a news release highlighting an LSU student who allegedly posted on social media “World famous fascist Charlie Kirk is dead. Rejoice,” and called on the university to take action against the student. 
Ballard said that while he is sad a student feels that way, they have a right to free speech.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Ahead of an expected run for governor, former Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor is asking the state’s campaign finance regulator to exempt him from a law that requires he disclose who is renting apartments in several Anchorage buildings he owns.
Treg Taylor and his wife Jodi Taylor own the Inlet View Tower in Anchorage as well as two other apartment complexes in South Anchorage and near Midtown.
Under state law, public officials must file an annual financial disclosure form that lists the sources of their income, including rental income, if it is above $1,000. The Alaska Public Offices Commission, which collects and publishes that information, can waive the requirement that a public official provide the identities of his or her renters.
Taylor filed a request for an exemption in March, but that request came after the deadline to submit his 2024 disclosure form.
The Public Offices Commission is perennially underfunded and understaffed, and its electronic submission process doesn’t work properly with rental income, according to a staff report. 
Only 15 out of roughly 1,200 filers have rental income, commission staff said in a written report, and of those 15, only four have more than 20 tenants. The Taylors claim to have 234 renters. 
In a Wednesday hearing, Jodi Taylor asked commissioners to grant the Taylors the waiver, saying that people have tried to talk to their tenants about them.
“I felt like, in this case, people are trolling,” Jodi Taylor said.
She said one of her employees had been threatened with a gun, and that she believed disclosure could pose a safety risk.
Treg Taylor did not participate in the hearing on Wednesday.
Commissioners, who have not yet ruled on the request for a waiver, appeared skeptical of Jodi Taylor’s arguments.
Heather Hebdon, director of the commission, said there was “no legal justification” to exempt disclosure and that there was a substantial public interest in the information.
“The purposes of public official financial disclosures in part are to assure that public officials and their official acts are free from the influence of undisclosed business interests and to allow the public to have access to the information necessary to judge the public officials’ credentials or performance in office,” she said.
Taylor resigned as Alaska Attorney General last month, a position he held since 2021. His last day in office was Aug. 29, and his public appearances both before and after his resignation resemble those of currently registered candidates for the 2026 governor’s race.
