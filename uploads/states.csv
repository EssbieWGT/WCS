Before Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, he asked several of his friends to continue his life’s work building what he called “beloved community.” One of the people he invited was the Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk, poet and mindfulness teacher Thich Nhat Hanh.
My new book, “On Mindful Democracy: A Declaration of Interdependence to Mend a Fractured World,” is inspired by King and Hanh’s friendship. These two men bonded over the shared insight that how we show up for each other matters, as does how we advocate for social change. In his sermon “Loving Your Enemies” King announced, “Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.” Hanh taught: There is no way to peace, peace is the way.“
At the heart of beloved community is true democracy. To be agents of change who do not add to the suffering of the world, people must learn to become more loving and peaceful people.
 ‘The real enemies of man’

Hanh was born in 1926 in central Vietnam. As a young Buddhist monk living in a nation confronted by colonialism, conflict and war, he developed the doctrine of ”engaged Buddhism,“ premised on the belief that working to relieve suffering in the world is enlightenment.
During the mid-1960s, amid the Vietnam War – Vietnamese call it the “American War” – Hanh founded the School of Youth for Social Services to practice engaged Buddhism and help those affected by the bombs raining down on their homes.
On June 1, 1965, Hanh wrote a letter to King to raise awareness of the suffering of the Vietnamese people. He also hoped to correct some common misconceptions about Buddhism.
His overarching point was that Buddhists in Vietnam did not hate Americans. In fact, they did not hate anyone. Their goal was simply to bring an end to war – and an end to the delusions that led to war. “Their enemies are not man. They are intolerance, fanaticism, dictatorship, cupidity, hatred and discrimination which lie within the heart of man,” he wrote. “These are the real enemies of man – not man himself.”
Hanh refused to take a side during the war. He stood for peace. His peace activism earned him a 39-year banishment from his homeland.
 Continuing King’s dream

Marc Andrus, author of the 2021 book “Brothers in the Beloved Community,” notes that King and Hanh met in person twice: once in Chicago, on May 31, 1966, and a second time in May 1967, at the World Council of Churches Peace on Earth Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. In Geneva, King shared his understanding of the beloved community with Hanh, inviting him to participate in its construction.
In between these two meetings, King nominated Hanh for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize, writing in his nomination letter, “I know Thich Nhat Hanh, and am privileged to call him my friend.” No award was given that year, however, perhaps to protest King’s choice to make his nomination letter public. Nominations were typically private, but King used his to call out the injustice of the Vietnam War.
Hanh was crushed when he learned of King’s death in 1968. “I was in New York when I heard the news of his assassination; I was devastated. I could not eat; I could not sleep,” he later recalled. “I made a deep vow to continue building what he called ‘the beloved community’ not only for myself but for him also. I have done what I promised Martin Luther King Jr. And I think that I have always felt his support.”
 Building ‘beloved community’

In the years after King’s murder, part of Hanh’s life work was devoted to fulfilling King’s dream and building the “beloved community.”
Beloved community is not an abstraction. It is a loose-knit global community composed of a multitude of smaller, local communities committed to practicing peace, nonviolence, freedom, love and justice. Emerging from King’s activism and Hanh’s engaged Buddhism, these communities are also committed to social change.
In 1982, Hanh and his student Sister Chan Khong established the Plum Village monastery in southern France. In the years since, the Plum Village community has founded dozens of monasteries around the world, including three in the United States: Blue Cliff in upstate New York, Deer Park outside San Diego, and Magnolia Grove in Mississippi.
Hanh’s lay students have established thousands of smaller Plum Village sanghas – communities – in North America and Europe. These monasteries and sanghas serve as practice centers where people learn to embody the ideals of beloved community in their mindfulness practice and daily lives.
Since the time of the Buddha, people committed to the path of mindfulness have agreed to live by a number of “precepts.” These precepts, typically numbering five, provide a moral foundation for action. Hundreds of thousands of people attending Plum Village retreats have agreed to live by the updated, secular version of the precepts that Hanh and his community wrote called the Five Mindfulness Trainings. These include: reverence for life, true happiness, true love, loving speech and deep listening, and nourishment and healing.
The Five Mindfulness Trainings are written to provide people with a practical path to building a shared life based in love, compassion, joy and peace: the type of life that both King and Hanh envisioned for all.
As Hanh told the global Plum Village community in a 2020 letter titled Climbing Together the Hill of the Century: “We have continued that aspiration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and every day, our practice is to generate brotherhood and sisterhood, to cultivate joy and the capacity to help people. This is a concrete way to realize and continue that dream.”
On MLK Day, their friendship and writings are a reminder that democracy rests on the ability of citizens to be present for each other, to recognize their interconnectedness, to embody loving kindness and to disagree without resorting to violence.

The government of this state works for you.
You know who has the best claim to that glorious Statehouse building in downtown Topeka? You do. Not lawmakers or lobbyists or associated special interests. That building exists to make your life and the lives of your friends and neighbors better. However bizarre or dark the news that flows from that place, never forget your ownership of its marble halls.


Statehouse scraps
Opinion editor Clay Wirestone’s weekly roundup of Kansas legislative exploits. Read the archive.


You can visit. You should visit. Anyone can come into the building and watch the House or Senate in session. You can chat with those lawmakers or lobbyists or associated special interests. You can just watch and make fun of them in your mind.
You don’t need to have to a reason to go. Drop by anytime during business hours. That’s the power of living in a representative democracy. Your elected officials answer to you. If they don’t, they will shortly be replaced by other elected officials. Any Kansan has the right, even the obligation, to check up on those paid to govern on their behalf.
I had already planned to kick off my inaugural Statehouse Scraps column of 2026 with this little sermon. But it turns out that someone else had similar thoughts last week.
This would be AFL-CIO executive secretary-treasurer Jake Lowen, who told a labor rally Wednesday that the Statehouse can feel like it’s built for “other people, fancy people, people in suits.”
“But you know what? This is your house. This is your state,” he proclaimed.


 

 Opinion editor Clay Wirestone and editor in chief Sherman Smith sum up the Kansas Legislature’s week in the first installment of Statehouse Chats.
He’s right.
One of the reasons that I write about legislators the way I do — irreverently, including comparisons to tipsy raccoons — is that we treat people in power with far too much reverence. They work for us. Sure, people might badmouth lawmakers on Facebook, but they don’t want to make waves in public.
That good-natured civility makes sense while avoiding conflict in your daily life. But it doesn’t work if it keeps you from voicing what you believe and demanding the people who serve you do their jobs.
So get in the car and visit the Statehouse. I know that folks in western Kansas face more of a challenge than those of us in the northeast. But you owe it to yourself to see where policy is made that affects all 3 million Kansas. All the lawmakers and public officials who work in the building must be reminded that they don’t do it for themselves or positive headlines.
They do it for you.

Their usual villains
The Legislature replayed one of its greatest hits last week. One of 2026’s first committee hearings tackled favorite Republican villains: transgender people.
You might think that trans folks just live among us out in the world, going to work and raising families and drinking Diet Coke. As people do. But no, because trans folks express their true gender identity, Kansas officials have targeted them repeatedly in recent years. Remember kids, elected officials believe that being different is bad.
The latest bill was touted by Secretary of State Kris Kobach as a way to supposedly reduce confusion with driver’s licenses and birth certificates. It would  ultimately require that these documents list a person’s sex at birth.
This justification didn’t make any sense with earlier bills. It doesn’t make any sense now.
If someone is a transgender woman, the vast majority of the time they’re going to look like a woman. You’re going to identify that person as a woman if you see them out and about. If someone is a transgender man, the vast majority of the time they’re going to look like a man. You’re going to identify that person as a man if you see them out and about.
Forcing these people to carry identification documents that don’t align with their public presentation is a recipe for the exact confusion that Kobach decries. It also opens the door for law enforcement and officials to abuse transgender people.
Hundreds of pieces of testimony from those opposing House Bill 2426 were submitted on a laughably short timeframe. Advocates turned out in droves to oppose the bill — as they always have and always will.
Will the Republican leaders who direct their caucus listen? Count me skeptical.

Speedy session
For the second year in a row, word in the hallways of the Statehouse is that Senate President Ty Masterson, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins want to keep the session short and tight. Last year, the motivation appeared unclear — it did give both chambers the excuse to bypass traditional debate and discussion — but this year it’s no mystery.
Elections draw near.
Lawmakers won’t be able to raise money or campaign until the session ends. With primaries in August and the general in November, you better believe that Kansas politicians want to hit the road rather than sit in boring committee meetings.
This cuts both ways. On one hand, lawmakers will have less opportunity to pass hateful or harmful legislation (see above). On the other, leaders use tight deadlines to their advantage by rushing through legislation without appropriate vetting. This gets especially touchy when it comes to budgets and various line items, which can be fiddled with up until the last minute.

Closed GOP caucus
You might remember that House Republicans closed their daily caucus meetings to members of the news media last session. I wrote a whole column about the break with longstanding practice.
From the evidence of last week, they’re doing it again. I showed up at a caucus meeting Tuesday morning along with Reflector reporter Anna Kaminski. She checked and was told the gathering was off-limits for reporters. I’m going to monitor the situation as the session continues, and you’ll be hearing more in the weeks that come.
Meanwhile, Senate and House leadership continue to restrict press access to the floors of their respective chambers. (And not inviting us to their press conferences.) Don’t worry; we’ll cover them anyway.

Scraps on board
Welcome to the 2026 edition of Statehouse Scraps. I started writing this roundup column back in 2023. For three sessions, it appeared on Saturdays and collected tidbits from the week before.
For this 2026 session, I’m treating it somewhat differently. You’ll still see bits and bobs from the week that was, but I’ve decided to run it on Mondays. That allows us to talk more about the week that’s coming up and give you a sense of the big storylines in Topeka.
Press corps shifts at the Statehouse and continued pullback from publishers in covering state government news means that Kansas Reflector has a bigger role than ever in informing Kansas about the session. I want to respond to that, and I want to make sure you know we’re looking out for you.
As part of that effort, we’re also unveiling a weekly video podcast with editor-in-chief Sherman Smith and myself talking about the big stories and offering our own observations about what’s going on. Please let us know what you think.

(Photo nu Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech still ring true.
“When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people,” he warned, “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.”
Those words, delivered in 1967, still summarize today’s political moment. Instead of putting the lives of working Americans first, our leaders in Congress and the White House have prioritized advancing corporate profits and wealth concentration, slashing government programs meant to advance upward mobility, and deploying military forces across the country, increasing distrust and tension.
This historic regression corresponds with a recessionary environment for Black America in particular. That’s what my organization, the Joint Center, found in our report, “State of the Dream 2026: From Regression to Signs of a Black Recession.”
The economic landscape for Black Americans in 2026 is troubling, with unemployment rates signaling a potential recession. By December 2025, Black unemployment had reached 7.5% — a stark contrast to the national rate of 4.4%. This disparity highlights the persistent economic inequalities faced by Black communities, which have only been exacerbated by policy shifts that have weakened the labor market. The volatility in Black youth unemployment, which fluctuated dramatically in the latter months of 2025, underscores the precariousness of the situation.
The Trump administration’s executive orders have systematically dismantled structures aimed at promoting racial equality. By targeting programs such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order and defunding agencies like the Minority Business Development Agency, the administration has shifted federal support away from disadvantaged businesses.
As a result, Black-owned firms risk losing contracts and resources tied to federal programs, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced economic growth. These changes threaten billions in federal revenue for Black-owned firms and undermine efforts to move beyond racial inequality in the workforce.
The GOP’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in 2025, further entrenches inequality by providing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high-income households and corporations — while simultaneously slashing investments in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, limiting access to essential services for low-income households.
The technology sector, a critical component of the American economy, is also affected by this disregard for civil rights. Executive orders like “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” have stripped away protections that could advance inclusion in this rapidly growing field. As a result, the future of the American economy risks reinforcing past inequalities.
Dr. King’s call for strong, aggressive federal leadership in addressing racial inequality remains highly relevant. However, instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices. These choices undermine longstanding efforts to combat racial and economic disparities — and exemplify the regressive economic policies that coincide with rising Black unemployment.
As Dr. King stated, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” But urgent action is required. Unless we act deliberately, economic and racial inequalities will become entrenched, resulting in generational loss. The core question is whether we will move beyond our nation’s history of racism, materialism, and militarism, and — as Dr. King urged — embrace “the fierce urgency now” to advance equity.

Connecticut needs a regional approach to housing

A bill was passed by the legislature (HB 5002), and then the governor vetoed it.
In a special session over the summer, the legislature passed another housing bill, (HB 8002) which the governor signed and is now law. There are some things about it to admire, especially the provisions that seek to help our neighbors who are hardest hit by the housing crisis — people who have no housing at all, or whose housing is threatened by eviction.
It brings the language of “smart growth” into the conversation, encouraging the adoption of transit-oriented development districts, priority development housing zones, and the like. 
But it does not address in a serious way the housing crisis.
For decades now, many of Connecticut’s towns have successfully thwarted the creation of new housing within their borders that would help address the need. And under this new law these towns will unfortunately be able to continue to do so. (I refer to towns alone, and not cities, as the handful of actual cities in Connecticut have historically encouraged housing production.)
Last January, I argued that a more regional approach to land-use planning, guided by the state’s nine councils of governments “COGs” (which are composed of the cities and towns within their jurisdictions) might be a way to navigate between: a.) the statewide goal of producing more housing and b.) the desire of towns to control development within their borders without regard to the statewide housing crisis.
The new law does, in fact, lean heavily on the data-based, regional, land-use plans that the COGs have produced for years, and which the cities in towns within each COG’s region participate in drafting. These plans consider all the factors that good land-use planning requires, like the availability of infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and water and sewer facilities, as well as environmental conditions like wetlands and the protection of other fragile resources. But they have been, historically, basically advisory.
Now, provisions in this new law encourage towns to align their town-wide zoning to the regional plan for their COG jurisdiction. It lays out a lengthy and iterative process whereby the Secretary of the Office of Policy & Management reviews town zoning codes for compliance with the regional plans’ housing goals. But — and this is a big but — if a town’s housing goals do not meet the law’s goals for alignment with the regional plan, there are no real consequences. Essentially, the secretary may deny state funding to assist that town in planning for new housing, as well as state funding to plan and construct the infrastructure related to new housing.
But if the town’s leadership doesn’t want the new housing, denying them state funds to assist them in planning for new housing is hardly much of an incentive for each town to plan for new housing that they don’t want to begin with. Gov. Ned Lamont likes to describe this approach as “towns lead the way.” But towns leading the way is precisely what got us to where we are now – at least 110,000 homes short of the need.
The new law comes close to imagining a way forward, of bridging the gap between the statewide need for more housing and the so-called “local control” advocates who rail at “interference from Hartford.” It is important to remember that the 169 cities and towns in Connecticut are not independent entities but rather political subdivisions of the state, and have only the powers that the General Assembly grants them. Local control of zoning is conducted solely by the authority granted, and the rules laid out, in Chapter 124 of the Connecticut General Statues.
What this law still needs, if we are serious about addressing the housing shortage, is a bit more than holding back planning grants from recalcitrant towns. What I suggested a year ago, and I advocate now, is that the regional plans be activated as enforceable documents. If a developer is denied permits to build new housing in a town, but the regional plan envisions it, the law should provide the developer with a cause of action against the town on that basis.
This would operate along the lines of Chapter 8-30(g), which gives a developer a cause of action against a town that denies permits for any housing development that proposes some amount of affordable housing, if the town’s housing stock does not meet a 10 percent minimum affordable housing standard. But Section 8-30(g) is almost an anti-planning approach. It doesn’t matter if the proposed housing is located where it doesn’t make sense from a planning standpoint. What I am advocating is a pro-planning approach. If the regional plan envisions housing for a location, but the town says “No,” then the onus should be on the town to explain their denial to a judge.
Local control advocates can’t moan about “We don’t want Hartford telling us what to do” under this approach, because every city and town within each COG would have participated in the drafting of the regional plan. These regional plans are a far better way of guiding rational growth than arbitrary, one size fits all, standards for all 169 cities and towns. And we should use them, and let developers rely on them, and stop letting local control advocates, and the town governments they hold sway over, thwart us from meeting our housing goals as a state.

It is a present-day crisis affecting tens of thousands of families and straining our health care system in ways we can no longer afford to ignore.
  More than 80,000 Connecticut residents aged 65 and older are currently living with Alzheimer’s or other dementias. An estimated 130,000 family members provide unpaid care, contributing over 200 million hours annually – labor valued at more than $5 billion. At the same time, Medicaid spending related to Alzheimer’s exceeds $1.2 billion each year. These figures represent not only an economic burden, but countless households quietly navigating exhaustion, financial strain, and grief.
I know this reality personally. I am a Connecticut resident and a constituent of Rep. Jahana Hayes in the 5th District. Through sustained advocacy with her office, I was proud to see her cosponsor two bipartisan bills in 2025: the AADAPT Act and the ASAP Act. These bills focus on earlier diagnosis, improved access to care planning, and a stronger national response to dementia – all critical steps for families facing this disease.
  Early detection matters. New treatments and clinical trials are most effective in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s, yet too many people in Connecticut still receive diagnoses late, after years of missed or minimized symptoms. By then, options are limited, caregivers are already overwhelmed, and the trajectory of the disease is far harder to alter.
Connecticut has an opportunity to lead, but leadership requires urgency. It means supporting federal legislation that prioritizes early diagnosis and equitable access to care. It means strengthening caregiver supports and ensuring our health and social services systems are prepared for the realities of an aging population.
  CT Mirror published my letter on Alzheimer’s advocacy last summer. I’m writing again because the crisis has not eased – it has intensified. Families are still absorbing the burden largely alone, and the costs – human and economic – continue to rise.
  Alzheimer’s is not just a personal tragedy. It is a public health emergency. Connecticut can, and must, respond accordingly.

(Photo by STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — With two months to go before candidates must file to be on this year’s ballots, the state Democratic Party made a plea.
“RUN FOR OFFICE in 2026,” reads the top of an email sent Jan. 7 from state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain.
Democrats have announced bids for just two of the seven constitutional offices on the ballot this November: governor and state superintendent of education. The party is still talking with potential candidates, Spain told the SC Daily Gazette.
In her email, she pointed to that week’s slim margin of victory for Republican Greg Ford in a special election for a state House seat representing Dorchester County. He defeated Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani by just 21 votes, as determined by an automatic recount.
Ogletree Satani “ran one heck of a race,” Spain wrote, noting that President Donald Trump won the district by over 6 percentage points in 2024. (Statewide, he won by 18 points.) “The lesson to all of us is that we can compete and win if we run!”
The email was successful, Spain told the Gazette on Wednesday.
In one week, more than a hundred people filled out the candidate interest form attached to that email. “Dozens” of them checked a box showing interest in seeking a statewide office, according to Jon Burton, a party spokesperson.


Upcoming deadlines
To compete in the June 9 party primaries, candidates must file the forms and pay the required fees between March 16 and March 30.
The fee is 1% of the job’s salary over the entire term.
For statewide offices, that ranges from $4,243 for gubernatorial candidates to $8,560 to run for state superintendent.


It’s been 32 years since a Democrat competed for every statewide elected office in the South Carolina constitution. And back in 1994, there were two additional offices on the ballot.
The party has come close to having a candidate for every office since.
In 2006, a Democrat ran for every statewide office except attorney general. Then-Attorney General Henry McMaster ran unopposed for re-election that year. In 2002, the only constitutional office without a Democrat running was adjutant general, the leader of the state’s military department. Maj. Gen. Stan Spears ran unopposed that year for his fourth and final term before retiring. In 2014, voters approved taking that office off the ballot and making it a governor-appointed position.
Asked about Spain’s email, state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick said Democrats’ problem “isn’t a lack of candidates.
“It’s that voters simply aren’t buying what they’re selling,” he said in a statement to the SC Daily Gazette.
Two races with both parties on the ballot
A Democrat last won a statewide office in 2006, when Jim Rex was elected state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
This year, two Democrats, Lisa Ellis and Sylvia Wright, are running for the job overseeing the state agency for K-12 public schools. Whoever wins the June 9 Democratic primary will likely face Superintendent Ellen Weaver, who’s running for her second term. So far, no Republican has announced a challenge.
In 2022, the race for superintendent was the most crowded: Six Republicans and three Democrats ran to replace outgoing Superintendent Molly Spearman.
Ellis was a first-time candidate then. The 25-year veteran teacher of Richland 2 high schools, who in 2018 founded the online teachers’ group SC for Ed, won a three-way primary outright without needing a runoff, then lost to Weaver by 16 percentage points. In 2023, SC for Ed announced an indefinite pause to its lobbying efforts, four years after organizing a teachers’ rally at the Statehouse attended by an estimated 10,000 people.
Wright, who has two decades of classroom and administrative experience in rural South Carolina, resigned from her job last fall as a district coordinator for Dorchester 4 in order to campaign full-time.
Among all the statewide races on the ballot this year, the wide-open governor’s race has by far gotten the most attention.
It’s been 16 years since no incumbent ran for governor. Five Republicans and two Democrats have announced bids to replace Gov. Henry McMaster, who first ascended to the job nine years ago when then-Gov. Nikki Haley joined President Donald Trump’s first administration. So, when voters first elected McMaster to the job in 2018, he’d already been governor almost two years.
In South Carolina, governors are limited to two elected terms. Other constitutional offices have no term limitations.
Two other offices are wide open
Two other statewide offices that have gotten little attention are wide open for the first time in over two decades.
Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers is not seeking a sixth full term. It’s been 16 years since a Democrat challenged him.
Voters first elected Weathers in 2006, two years after Gov. Mark Sanford appointed the Orangeburg County dairy farmer to the job following the indictment of Charlie Sharpe, who was eventually sentenced to two years in prison for taking a bribe to protect a cockfighting ring.
Weathers endorsed Republican Fred West to replace him, The State newspaper reported last March. West retired in 2023 after 24 years as an executive at the poultry processing company Amick Farms and his since become director of market development at the Department of Agriculture.
So far, West is the only candidate to announce a bid to lead the agency with duties that include promoting one of the state’s top industries, keeping the food supply safe, and — since 2024 — handling all inspections of places that sell food, such as restaurants and cafeterias.
The job of comptroller general is open for the first time in 28 years, when then-Sen. Jim Landers replaced the retiring Earle Morris Jr.
That 1998 election was also the last time a Democrat won the post as the state’s chief accountant. In 2002, Republican Richard Eckstrom ousted Landers and kept the job for 21 years. Eckstrom resigned in 2023 amid mounting pressure over his office’s $3.5 billion accounting error. (The error was strictly on paper. No money went missing due. The office mistakenly double-counted some agencies’ revenue.)
McMaster made history in appointing his budget director, Brian Gaines, who by agreeing to run the office temporarily became South Carolina’s first Black constitutional officer since Reconstruction. Gaines said at the time he had no interest in running in 2026.
One Republican has announced a bid: Mike Burkhold, a Charleston businessman who founded Equiscript, a health care technology company.
For two other statewide offices, Republicans are seeking re-election without any announced competition.
Secretary of State Mark Hammond, first elected in 2002, is seeking a seventh term leading the office that registers and helps regulate businesses and charities operating in South Carolina. (Unlike in other states, South Carolina’s secretary of state plays no role at all in overseeing elections.)
Treasurer Curtis Loftis, first elected in 2010, also got came under fire recently for accounting problems. Senate investigations into the comptroller general’s office led to discovery of a $1.8 billion error in the treasurer’s office — also a blunder on paper that didn’t affect state revenues or the Legislature’s budgeting process. An outside accounting firm found that all but $200 million never existed. But senators were incensed, voting 33 to 8 last April to remove him. The House, however, never took up the case.
Amid a grilling from senators, Loftis initially pledged that he would not seek re-election in 2026. But he later reversed course and announced he’s seeking a fifth term. He maintains that he did nothing wrong.

Delaware Legislative Hall, Dover, Delaware, USA
convened in the second half of the 153rd Session of the General Assembly, this week.  The normal, more relaxed tone to the opening session was tempered by recent events, including the murder of Cpl. Matthew “Ty” Snook at the Delaware DMV offices two weeks ago.  Tensions seemed to be running high, leading to an outburst on the Senate floor, as Senate Concurrent Resolution 114 was introduced.  This is a measure, introduced by Sen. Bryant Richardson, that would add Delaware to the list of states authorizing an Article V “Convention of the States” resolution to introduce a slate of U.S. Constitutional amendments.  Heated exchanges led to a call for greater civility in these floor discussions, with a resolution (SCR124) by Sen. Kyra Hoffner passing unanimously in the Senate and echoed by a voice vote in the House, shortly after.  Sen. Brian Pettyjohn reinforced the unanimous call for civility in legislator discourse.  The resolution for the Convention of States, failed to pass with a vote of 7-7, with 7 senators choosing not to vote.  Senator Hansen joined the Republican members in voting for the resolution.
The session opened with a resolution recognizing “Law Enforcement Appreciation Day” as January 9th.  Comments we made by Sen. Nicole Poore, a close friend of the Snook family, and Secretary of the Senate, Ryan Dunphy, Snook’s brother-in-law.
There were a handful of other bills addressed in the opening days.  These included:
SB213 – “Amend Code Related to Hospital Review Board” 

This controversial law from 2025 was amended according to an agreement that followed legal challenges by hospital associations. The bill would still require hospitals to submit financial data to the Diamond State Hospital Cost Review Board to increase transparency around costs and spending trends, however it removes the authority of the board to approve or modify future budgets.  The bill was released from the Senate Executive Committee, with all 7 members approving (2 “Favorable”, 5 “On the Merits”) and sent to the Senate Floor for a vote.  There is an end of January deadline in the agreement related to the legal challenges.

SB222 – “Term Limits for Legislators, Attorney General, State Treasurer, State Auditor and State Insurance Commissioner” 

Senators would be limited to 5 terms, Representatives would be limited to 8 terms and others would be limited to 2 terms each.

SB106 – “Cell Phone Use Policies for Schools” 
Did not dictate policy, but laid out areas that must be addressed by the school policy.  This passed the Senate unanimously in 2025 and was passed by the House unanimously at the start of the 2026 session.
SB27 – “Establishing the Office of New Americans”

Codifies the executive actions of Gov. Meyer to establish this office “to help improve the lives and economic prosperity of new Americans who come to Delaware.” There does not appear to be a distinction between legal and illegal immigrants in this bill.  A sunset provision was added by Sen. Bryant Richardson.  The measure passed the Senate, as amended, unanimously and was sent to the House.

SB188 “Expand Permit to Purchase Handgun Exemptions to Law Enforcement Procurement”

The “Permit to Purchase” law (SB2) had not excluded the purchasing function of law enforcement agencies to supply their officers and candidates. This passed unanimously in the Senate and was sent to the House.  In a related article, we will explore the impact of SB2, as Delaware handgun purchases are down by 80%, as the processes for obtaining and exercising permits are not fully in place.  This is placing an incredible financial burden on firearms dealers in the state.

A number of other bills are expected to receive attention in this current session, including:
HS2 for HB13 “Added/Revised Tax Brackets”

Creates added brackets for $150K (amended from $125K), $250K & $500K, as the state faces concerns over decreasing revenue. This bill was deferred, as revenue estimates for 2026 were increased.  There is long term concern over the pace of budget increases.

HB72, HB73 & HB108 “Property and Income Tax Relief for Seniors”

Republican-sponsored bills to increase the Senior property tax deduction, reduce the residency period back to 3 years and increase the pension exclusion were not allowed to progress.

SB2 & SB3 Constitutional Amendments Affecting “Early, In-Person” and “No Excuse Absentee” Voting have progressed  to House vote.  HB65 “Moving Primary Election Date to April” is also pending Senate vote.

These CA’s will require 2027-2028 votes, if passed. HB65 will align primary dates with Presidential Primary and provide for longer General Election campaign.  These were all deferred to 2026 and will not affect the 2026 elections.

Protections for Illegal Immigration are progressing – HB58, HB60, HB93, HB94 , HB95, HB96, HB150 & HB151

Limiting schools and State/local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement agencies or providing information from state files and resources. These were not yet passed in 2025.

Expanding protected classes under the umbrella of anti-discrimination continues – HB115 & SB78

Impacts policies ranging from “boys competing in girls’ sports” to “fat-shaming” under a broadened umbrella of protections and protected categories.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/istockphoto-168250183-612x612-1.jpg,,,2026-01-18 14:56:25.884488

(Photo: Izzy Ross/IPR News)This story is made possible through a partnership between Interlochen Public Radio and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
Students at Traverse City West Senior High School are raising money to install solar panels on their campus so they can learn about renewable energy.
Srinergy, a Michigan-based solar company, donated 14 ground panels to the school and students need to fundraise money to cover installation costs. They aim to raise more than $11,000 by the end of this school year.
The school’s Environmental Club is leading the effort. Lucy Jones, the club’s president and senior at TC West, said clean energy like solar will only become more common as students get older. That makes this project important for their education, she said.
“It’s good for students to learn about it now and learn about how it works, so then in the future, they’re able to know about it and use renewable energy in their lives,” Jones said.
The goal of the project is to teach students, but the 14 panels would generate about 7,000 kilowatt hours of electricity for the building. That’s an estimated 5% of the school’s electricity use, according to the project proposal from Srinergy.
Mary Brisbois, a science teacher at TC West, said data from these solar panels could help teach students in her environmental science class about how renewable energy works. Other science and math teachers have expressed interest to Brisbois in using data for their classes, too.
Students are also responsible for fundraising, she said. That way, students can learn that “money is something to figure out” and not always “a complete roadblock,” Brisbois said.
Lyla Hollis is a clean energy specialist at the nonprofit Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities and a partner in the school solar project. She said just seeing the installation of the panels could be beneficial to students.
“Getting the solar panels installed into the electric system is not that hard, but it is a process, and to learn how to do that on a small scale is pretty cool to see,” Hollis said. “The actual steps, you can implement it in different classes and learn how the chemistry works and all that stuff, which is more than I learned in school.”
Jones said she’s optimistic her classmates will raise enough money by the end of the year, with the help of the local community. And she’s excited for future students to benefit, long after she graduates.
“It’ll be something that the whole school will get to see and experience and gain information and knowledge from and then on to future generations,” she said. “It’s kind of like giving something to the school and giving back to our community.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/m-72-solar-panels-8.2.23-1024x768.png,,,2026-01-18 13:56:44.118578

For years, both Democrats and Republicans in Michigan have advocated expanding FOIA to include the two branches of government, but no deal has been reached.
Currently, two bills aiming to expand Michigan’s FOIA laws (Senate Bills 1 and 2) are sitting in the House’s Governmental Operations Committee awaiting discussion. However, Michigan Speaker of the House Matt Hall stated that he wasn’t interested in putting the bills on the agenda.
“We’re just not going to do FOIA,” Hall told reporters during a Nov. 6 press conference.
Michigan’s Democratic-led Senate started 2025 by quickly introducing and passing the bills, with 33 yeas and two nays. After moving off the Senate floor, SB 1 and 2 were read by the House and have remained in committee since January.
‘Let’s get it done,’ Moss says as Michigan FOIA reform clears Senate again

“If this were put up for a vote in the House, it would pass,” said Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), co-author of the bills. “There’s no doubt. It has the votes.
“The question is, why won’t the speaker put it up for a vote?”
Hall recently celebrated the passing of two earmark reform bills (Public Acts 32 and 33 of 2025), which require legislators to disclose spending on individual projects before a final budget is put up for a vote. The passing of these bills completes part of Hall’s Ethics, Accountability and Transparency, or HEAT, plan, which he believes will be more beneficial to the public than expanding FOIA.
“We ask people all the time, they know HEAT will have a much better benefit than  FOIA,” Hall said during the conference.
Michigan Press Association Public Policy Manager Lisa McGraw said that the reform bill is a step in the right direction, but that the state government could, and should, do more.
“I think until the governor and the legislature in the state are subject to FOIA, we really have no transparency at the state level,” said McGraw, who has been working to expand FOIA since 2015.
Hall did not provide comment for this story.
Senators Moss and McBroom’s mission for FOIA
SB 1 and 2 are in the same position as other FOIA expansion bills that have been introduced in recent years.
Since joining the State Senate in 2019, Moss and Sen. Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan) have co-authored four bills in an attempt to expand FOIA:

Senate Bill 1 of 2025
Senate Bill 2 of 2025
Senate Bill 669 of 2023
Senate Bill 670 of 2023

While serving as the state representative for Michigan’s 35th District, Moss introduced House Bill 4149 of 2017, which would have made the legislature and the governor subject to FOIA. Just like his and McBroom’s Senate bills, the House bill was referred to committee and wasn’t put on the agenda for a vote.
“It was the first bipartisan package that got out of the House that term, and the Senate Leader (Arlan Meekhof) said, ‘I’m not taking this up,’” Moss said.
According to a 2017 story by the Detroit Free Press, Meekhof told journalists, “You guys are the only people who care about this” referencing Moss and McBroom’s bill.
Both senators will be term limited at the end of 2026. Both stated they will continue to push for expanding the public’s right to know.
“We would really like to see this project through,” Moss said. “It’s not fun to work on something for 10 years, and make progress on it, and not get past the finish line. But we’re working really, really hard to achieve this.”
The campaign on FOIA expansion
In 2018, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer stated that she would work to expand FOIA laws to include the governor’s office and legislature.
“I mean, unilaterally we could open up the executive branch to FOIA and ensure that there is real notice and real searchable capabilities online,” Whitmer said in an interview on PBS Detroit in July of 2018. “The public and the press need tools so they can get information.”
Whitmer signed Public Acts 32 and 33 of 2025 into law and praised the bills.
“Since I took office, I’ve been committed to increasing transparency in our government, so Michiganders know exactly where their hard-earned dollars are going,” Whitmer stated in a press release. “I made a promise to increase transparency on legislative earmarks in my most recent State of the State. Less than a year later, I’m proud to sign these two bills that require lawmakers to put their names on any projects they propose.”
“I’ll keep working with anyone to serve Michiganders and increase transparency in our government.”

Whitmer made the calendars for her office and the office of Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist open to the public – as well as her federal income tax returns and personal financial information.
However, her promise to extend FOIA to her office has not yet been met.
Whitmer did not provide comment for this story.
“Since the (Whitmer) administration started, we have not gone anywhere despite an entire campaign called the Sunshine Report, when she was running the first time,” said McGraw.
In 2018, Whitmer released an eight-page document titled “Get it Done: Michigan Sunshine Plan,” highlighting issues with Michigan’s transparency and ethics laws and what she wanted to change if elected governor.
“If the legislature won’t act, I will use the governor’s authority under the Michigan State Constitution to extend FOIA to the Lieutenant Governor and Governor’s Offices,” Whitmer stated in the report. “ Michiganders should know when and what their governor is working on.”
While discussing the history of politicians advocating for expanding FOIA, Attorney General Dana Nessel told Central Michigan Life that false promises are often made during campaigns.
“No one runs for governor being like, ‘absolutely not, I don’t agree with that,” Nessel said. “Everyone says what they think everyone wants to hear, and maybe they really think that, until they get (into office).’’
As Whitmer’s term comes to an end in 2026, candidates in the gubernatorial race have started to make promises on expanding FOIA.
“On day one, I will voluntarily comply with FOIA,” said Democratic candidate Jocelyn Benson, who has served as Secretary of State since 2019. “Every job I’ve had, whether it’s been running a law school or running the Department of State, I’ve complied with FOIA proudly.”
Republican candidate and Former House Speaker Tom Leonard shared a similar commitment during an interview with Central Michigan Life in October.
“Michigan is only one of two states in the entire country whose executive branch and legislature is not subject to open records and FOIA. That needs to change,” Leonard said. “People of this state deserve to know what’s going on in their executive branch and legislature.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_9944-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 11:56:26.353815

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s second most populous county has agreed it will no longer jail people who can’t afford to pay the daily fees attached to the state’s signature sobriety program.
Pennington County’s settlement in a federal class action lawsuit could impact the way counties operate the 24-7 program, which originated in South Dakota and has since spread to other states. 
People accused of crimes involving drugs or alcohol can be assigned to the program and released as they await trial, or as part of their sentence, on the condition they submit to sobriety monitoring and pay for it.
The participation price varies based on the type of monitoring involved and how long a person takes part. Some people pay $2 a day for breath testing, while others pay $30-$42 a week for urinalysis drug testing or alcohol monitoring bracelets. Judges also permit participants to shift from one method to another along the way to better suit their financial or life circumstances. 
Some people remain on the program for weeks or months, and occasionally for a year or more, depending on how long it takes for their case to work its way through the court system. 
Drunken driving courts prepare for more action from minimum-sentence law

The Pennington County settlement comes in a lawsuit filed in 2023 by a Rapid City man named Ricky Lookingback, who’d been ordered to participate in drug testing. 
He was jailed for failure to pay a 24-7 fee, which he argued was a violation of constitutional prohibitions on jailing people for debt. He also alleged that he belonged to a class of individuals who’d been jailed for the same reason in Pennington County, and asked for a judgment on behalf of all class members.
Under the terms of the agreement, Lookingback and 37 others jailed for inability to pay program fees are members of the class and are each eligible for cash payments, with Lookingback in line for $10,000 and the others for $1,000 each. The settlement also dictates that no one can be jailed or threatened with jail time for their inability to pay program fees.
Class members will have the opportunity to object to the terms of the settlement at a hearing in February. A federal judge can then accept or reject the agreement, which has been signed by Lookingback and county officials.
Jim Leach, Lookingback’s Rapid City lawyer, said the settlement should put all South Dakota counties on notice that jailing the indigent is a civil rights violation and could draw a legal challenge.
“I’ve got nothing against the 24-7 program,” Leach said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “From everything I can gather, it’s a really good program that has helped a lot of people. But nonetheless, the basic constitutional law in this country is that we cannot jail people for poverty.”
24-7 built on frequent testing, participant fees
Under the 24-7 program, testing fees are due at the time of testing or in advance.
In the cheapest and most common form of 24-7, people appear twice daily at a local jail to take breath tests for alcohol, at a cost of $1 per test. Those who fail a test or fail to show up can be put in jail, after which a judge decides whether to release them again.
More than 90,000 people have been on some version of the program since its launch, and hundreds participate every day. Its rollout began as a three-county pilot project in 2005 under the guidance of former Attorney General Larry Long, who’d tried it decades earlier as Bennett County’s state’s attorney.
In testimony before the Legislature in 2022, Long called it “the most efficient tool to reduce DUIs ever enacted in South Dakota.”
Driving under the influence arrests have not dropped dramatically since the program launched, but they also haven’t grown in line with the state’s population, which is 20% higher today than in 2005. 
DUI arrests hit 11,612 in 2024, the last full year reported in the Department of Public Safety’s annual summary. That was the highest tally since 2007, the year the 24-7 program went statewide, when there were 11,756 DUI arrests. 
Long stepped down as attorney general in 2009 to become a circuit court judge. In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, he said DUIs holding more or less steady is a sign that the program works. 
The bigger impact, Long said, has been on felony drunken driving charges and alcohol-related traffic crashes. 
In 2007, when the program went statewide, there were 1,092 felony DUI charges, each representing a third or subsequent offense. By 2017, the year he retired as a judge, that number had fallen to 699. In the last fiscal year, there were 468 charges for such repeat offenses, according to the Unified Judicial System.
Alcohol-related crashes, meanwhile, hit a record high of 630 in 2006, according to the Department of Public Safety. The highest tally since then was 535, recorded in 2021. In 2024, there were 458 such crashes.
Since its start in South Dakota, versions of the 24-7 program have spread to other states, including North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Wisconsin and Utah.
Constitutional concerns about jailing the program’s poorest participants have always been a sticking point, Long said, even for people who’ve generally supported the concept. 
The price point for breath tests was set low intentionally, he said, in hopes of making the program accessible to the widest range of people.
From the start, Long advised the county sheriffs who run the programs that an inability to pay shouldn’t be enough to draw immediate sanctions. 
“What I used to say during my presentations was ‘if you skip or if you fail, you go to jail,’” said Long. “You don’t go to jail for not paying.”
Long acknowledged, however, that local officials may not have always followed that guidance.
There are no statewide statistics on how many people may have been jailed for failure to pay 24-7 fees, according to the Attorney’s General’s Office, since counties manage their own programs. During debate on a bill to alter the program in 2022, administrators said punishment for failure to pay alone is a rarity, based on reports from counties.
Fees still too much for some
The 24-7 fees may be fairly low, but they’re still more than some people have, said Leach. 
Lookingback was and remains homeless, Leach said, and he was placed in a version of 24-7 that required him to take three drug tests each week, at a cost of $10 per test. 
Court documents in the case, filed by Pennington County, say Lookingback was released from jail and ordered to sign in to the program and did not on multiple occasions in 2023. On those occasions, the county said, he was sanctioned for failure to appear for testing.
In the fall of that year, he was again ordered into the program. On Sept. 23, 2023, he showed up but didn’t have the $10 needed to pay the fees. As a result, Leach said, Lookingback found himself again incarcerated at the Pennington County Jail.
If a judge accepts the settlement agreement, Pennington County will pay Lookingback $10,000 for that incarceration, and will set aside another $37,000 for the 37 other people who were found to have been jailed for their inability to pay. 
Leach will be required to “make reasonable efforts” to contact the 37 people, who were identified in county records obtained over the course of the lawsuit. Any money that goes uncollected, the settlement says, will be given to a nonprofit organization called the Public Justice Debtor’s Project. The New York-based nonprofit works to address issues related to the jailing of defendants for unpaid court fees across multiple jurisdictions. 
Leach can ask the judge to order Pennington County to pay attorney’s fees, but the settlement says he’s entitled to none of the money the county’s already promised to pay through the agreement.
Helene Duhamel, spokeswoman for the Pennington County Sheriff’s Department, said in a statement the settlement “clarifies that 24-7 Sobriety Program participants who have not paid the court-ordered fees” won’t be incarcerated.
“Instead, individuals who have not paid the 24-7 Program fees may be reported to the courts or supervising authority,” Duhamel said. “Any sanction decisions for nonpayment would be set by the court.”
A judge can look at each case individually to determine if the person who didn’t pay on a given day truly could not afford to, or if they were able to pay and didn’t. Participants can be sanctioned under the latter circumstance, under the terms of the settlement, but not for a legitimate lack of funds. 
The settlement applies to the 37 known members of the class, Leach said, but the class also includes any people who “have been or will in the future be incarcerated in Pennington County, threatened with incarceration or sanctions, based in whole or in part on inability to pay the fees required to participate in the 24-7 Program.” 
The county currently has 352 people in the program.
Other counties, statewide impacts
Lucas Oyler, the program’s former state coordinator, told lawmakers in 2022 that an inability to threaten jail for failure to pay might cause county sheriffs, who administer 24-7 tests, to opt out of participating in the program.
Leach said he doubts that. He said the majority of people who wind up involved in the criminal justice system, even those deemed income-eligible for a court-appointed lawyer, are able to pay $2 a day. 
“But at the same time, there’s a certain group of people who are just poor,” Leach said, in ways that are “far beyond anything” most people have experienced.
‘Treated like a criminal’: Native woman’s death sparks questions

Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead was among the first sheriffs to use 24-7, and he’s been following the Pennington County lawsuit closely. 
The policy for 24-7 participants in Minnehaha County, he said, is built around an understanding that an inability to pay doesn’t justify an immediate jail stay.
“If a person has been released from jail and ordered by a judge to comply with the 24-7 program as a condition of release but cannot pay,” Milstead wrote in an email to South Dakota Searchlight, “then it is up to the judge to decide whether bond should be revoked, modified, or remain.”
In response to questions from South Dakota Searchlight on how counties ought to proceed in the face of the successful class action lawsuit, Attorney General Marty Jackley issued a statement saying his office intends to let counties decide the right approach.
“While we cannot dictate how an agency operates its program,” Jackley wrote, “we are committed to supporting them in ensuring compliance with state statutes and administrative rules.”
Long, the former attorney general who launched the program, said a case can be made that counties — or even community organizations — would benefit in the long run if they decide to pay 24-7 fees for the indigent, who might be “among the ones who’d most benefit from it.”
Keeping habitual drinkers or drug users sober can reduce visits to the emergency room, Long said, as well as business losses from theft.

Wisconsin lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers rushed to finish the state budget in July, ahead of federal legislation making it to President Donald Trump’s desk, to ensure the state draw down additional federal funds. Whether the state will be able to benefit from that funding is now uncertain. 
The 2025-27 state budget included a provision to increase its Medicaid hospital assessment from 1.8% to 6% as a way to supplement the state’s Medicaid resources with matching contributions from the federal government. The change was meant to increase payments to hospitals and to offset the state’s funding for the Medical Assistance program. It was estimated to result in over $1 billion in additional revenue for Wisconsin hospitals. 
A Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis this week found that “preliminary federal guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has created some uncertainty about the allowability of changes to Wisconsin’s hospital assessment.”
29 Marklein Born Revenue Estimates
The analysis said that if the increase is disallowed then it would lead to a general purpose revenue shortfall of $396 million annually — or $792 million in the 2025-27 biennium.
“CMS indicated that this matter will be addressed through formal rule making procedures, and thus will be subject to provisions of notice and public comment. Pending additional information from the federal government, the allowability of the Act 15 changes is not currently known,” the LFB analysis stated. 
A group of eight Democratic state lawmakers, including state Rep. Steve Doyle and Sen. Brad Pfaff, both from Onalaska, sent a letter to U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden urging him to take action to help ensure Wisconsin receives the funds. Following the state budget, Van Orden claimed credit for helping secure the extra funds for the state.
“Our hospitals, and especially our rural hospitals were counting on that funding to keep their
doors open… At a time when our medical institutions are facing unprecedented financial challenges, we must do everything we can to ensure their ability to continue to operate. Our state budget was counting on it, and our constituents’ lives literally depend on it. We implore you to do everything in your power to reverse these catastrophic decisions,” the lawmakers wrote.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Department of Energy/Bechtel)Congress this week approved a $3.2 billion budget for the Hanford nuclear reservation’s cleanup in fiscal 2026 — a more than $200 million increase from the prior two years.
That is more than what the Trump administration originally requested for Hanford, but almost $3 billion less than what Washington officials believe is needed this year to keep the site’s cleanup on its legally mandated timetable. This is also the biggest cleanup budget in Hanford’s history.
President Donald Trump’s budget request allocated slightly less than $400 million to operate Hanford’s biggest project — the new plant to convert the site’s radioactive waste into glass, which began operating in October. 
Congress bumped that budget up to $480 million, according to the office of Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
Murray said in a statement that Thursday’s Senate approval was “a rejection of the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine the Hanford cleanup mission.” 
“We cannot do nuclear waste cleanup on the cheap,” she said. 
The House passed the same budget earlier this month.
Washington’s Department of Ecology calculates that Hanford needs a budget of $6.15 billion to meet all of its legal cleanup obligations for fiscal 2026, and $6.76 billion for fiscal 2027. 
Hanford’s cleanup is governed by an often-litigated and often-changed 35-year-old legal agreement between the state, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
“The federal government has a big job to do cleaning up Hanford,” Gov. Bob Ferguson,  a Democrat, said in a statement. “This budget is a positive step forward in ensuring they live up to their responsibilities.”
“We have made important progress this year. Let’s keep up the momentum,” he added.
Casey Sixkiller, director of the state ecology department, also acknowledged progress with the cleanup in the past year.
“We need to keep funding at a level where we can accelerate the pace of cleanup and reduce the risk of a catastrophic infrastructure collapse or contamination release,” Sixkiller said. “Now is the time for the federal government to double down and not back away from its legal and moral obligations to the people of Washington state. ”
Hanford is arguably the most radioactively contaminated spot in the Western Hemisphere.
The U.S. government set up Hanford in 1943 to create plutonium for the nation’s atomic bombs, including those exploded in New Mexico and over Nagasaki in 1945. That work created many billions of gallons of chemical and radioactive waste.
The worst 56 million gallons of that waste were pumped into 177 underground tanks. About a third of those tanks leak. At least a million gallons of radioactive liquid have leaked into the ground, seeping into the aquifer 200 feet below and then into the Columbia River, roughly seven miles away.
Hanford has just begun converting lesser radioactive wastes in the tanks into a benign glass to be eventually stored at an underground storage site at a still undetermined location. 
A second plant to tackle more radioactive waste could be operating in the 2030s. 
Since the low-activity waste plant will handle only 40-50% of the less radioactive wastes, Hanford recently decided to look into encasing the remaining low-activity materials in a cement-like substance, which would be theoretically faster and cheaper than building a second low-level glassification plant. 
Originally, the legal deadline to finish glassifying all 56 million gallons of tank wastes was 2019. 
Right now, Hanford’s legal target is removing all the waste from 149 single-shell tanks and closing those tanks by 2043, and closing the 28 newer and safer double-shell tanks by 2052. 
The Energy Department has moved those targets back to 2069, a date not reflected in its current cleanup agreements with the state of Washington, according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hanford-low-activity-waste-facility-containers-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 07:56:11.365376

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota must spend $106 million in remaining pandemic relief by the end of the year, or it has to be returned to the federal government.
Most of the funds left to spend are for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, housing, broadband, ambulance upgrades and telemedicine upgrades in nursing homes, according to a Wednesday presentation from the Bureau of Finance and Management at the Capitol in Pierre.
Bureau Commissioner Jim Terwilliger told lawmakers on the budget committee that the state will meet the deadline to “maximize those dollars.”
“We feel like we’re in a good place,” Terwilliger said.
Federal relief and stimulus funding for South Dakota in response to the COVID-19 pandemic included about $974 million from the State Fiscal Recovery Funds authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The unspent balance represents about 10% of that funding.


The funding has been transformative in some sectors of the state. South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources Secretary Hunter Roberts said during the last legislative session the influx of cash sparked an overdue “water renaissance.”
Roberts’ department has $75 million left to spend on water and sewer projects. Some projects that have used ARPA funding so far include upgrades for the Mni Waste Water Company in western South Dakota, a regional waterline upgrade for the Randall Community Water District in eastern South Dakota, and funding for the Western Dakota Regional Water System study.
The bureau receives quarterly department reports for how funding is spent. As the end of 2026 approaches, any unspent funds will be reallocated to water projects.
About $14 million for workforce housing projects, which is roughly a quarter of that program’s ARPA funding, has not been spent. A mix of federal and state funding was approved by lawmakers in 2022 to help increase South Dakota’s housing stock as the state’s population grows. Roughly $64 million in state-funded loans for workforce housing also remain unobligated, with Gov. Larry Rhoden proposing those state funds be shifted to airport improvement projects, and a legislative task force recommending the money be used for property tax credits.
About $4 million, which is nearly half of the ARPA funding meant to improve emergency medical services across the state, has not been spent, according to the presentation. About $2 million, which is three-quarters of the ARPA funding promised to nursing home telemedicine upgrades, hasn’t been spent yet either. Both grant programs are under the state Department of Health.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The effort of Mississippi House leaders and others to expand programs providing public funds to private schools validates the oft-repeated quote that “history may not repeat itself, but it often rhymes.”
Efforts by Mississippi legislators to send public funds to private schools go back to at least the 1960s.
The current effort, led by House Speaker Jason White and buttressed by President Donald Trump and Gov. Tate Reeves, would provide funds to parents to allow them to help pay for the children’s education at a private school.
The argument is made that such a scheme, sending the money to parents to help pay for their child’s private school education, will not violate Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution, which states definitively that public money may not go to schools not operating as “free schools.”
The argument is being made that it would be constitutional because the public money is going to the parent instead of the private school. Some would argue that the process is simply trying to achieve through deception what the Mississippi Constitution says is prohibited and, who knows, maybe that is the definition of lawyering.
There have been limited state court cases involving Section 208, and none of those addressed directly the issue of whether providing public funds to a family to be spent on a private school education is constitutional.
It is almost certain that many of the nine members of the Mississippi Supreme Court would prefer not to have to take up the explosive issue. But if the bill passes the Legislature, it is almost certain that it will land in justices’ laps at the state’s highest court.
While it does not appear there has been a state case addressing the particulars that will be in front of the Mississippi Supreme Court if the bill becomes law, in 1969 there was a federal case with similar facts. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a state law sending public funds, called tuition grants, to families to be spent on a private school education.
As the number of Mississippi private schools exploded in the 1960s to provide white students an escape from attending classes with Black students, the Mississippi Legislature passed a bill to provide funds to white students to be used to attend segregationist academies.
Many of those academies still exist today and could benefit if the new effort to provide public funds to private schools becomes law.
The 5th Circuit did not address Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution, but instead said the law was discriminatory. The 5th Circuit found that the law “encourages, facilitates and supports the establishment of a system of private schools operated on a racially segregated basis as an alternative available to white students seeking to avoid desegregated public schools.”
Granted, 2026 is much different than the 1960s. There are many private schools that enroll and do a good job educating Black students.
But there are still private schools that take great pride in being the sole overseer of their enrollment criteria. The private schools told legislators during a hearing on the issue last year that they would not relinquish their authority to decide who they enroll.
There are, no doubt, private schools that deny enrollment to certain disabled students because of the high cost of providing those children an education.
And, no doubt, there would be private schools that would balk at enrolling gay or trans students. Some private schools also might deny enrollment to students who openly embrace certain religious practices.
Are those forms of discrimination?
In 1969, like today, the executive branch of the federal government got involved in the issue of sending public funds to private schools. The Trump administration has endorsed the bill pending in the Mississippi Legislature.
In 1969 the Justice Department of then-president Richard Nixon opposed the effort to provide “tuition grants” for students to attend private schools.
The opposing positions taken by the two presidents perhaps proves that sometimes history does not repeat itself and doesn’t even rhyme.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/07022545/IMG-3225.jpg,,,2026-01-18 07:56:11.365376

The brave
Marga Camarinta, 15, Manchester Center

I am 4,
and a self-proclaimed 
hero of bravery.

The plane whirs in my ears,
loud and incessant and monstrous,
but I sit as calmly as I can.
Solemn and stoic
is this sugar-stuffed knight.

In this dark, blue light,
in this hollow, titanium titan,
I am illuminated by wonder.

Questions…
questions about a foreign land,
one shrouded in mystery,
with unfamiliar faces.
Like a faraway fantasy,

but tangible to the tips of my small, sticky fingers.

The United States of America:
the land of the free,
and apparently, 
the home of the brave.

Yet so unlike the home I am accustomed to,
and so far away from the ones I love.

But just as this hero feels herself falter
and fall into the mouth of the monster that is her fears,
she is swept up by a warm, wooly embrace,
rescued by her own hero of bravery:
her dazzling, fearless Mom.

The contract lays out a pay schedule that starts with a base wage of $34 an hour, putting the Hinesburg department relatively in line with other Chittenden County police forces.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in The Citizen on Jan. 15, 2026.
The Hinesburg police union, recognized by the town last June, has officially inked a contract with the town of Hinesburg.
The contract, which will go into effect in July, is set to last until June 2029 and outlines a slew of worker protections and benefits along with a step system for annual pay raises. The contract also comes at a time when Hinesburg is oriented toward building back up its police department, both by hiring a chief and filling out its vacant officer positions.
The Hinesburg officers had previously unionized under the Fraternal Order of Police in 2021, but never successfully negotiated a contract. Last year, they organized under the New England Police Benevolent Association and quickly began negotiations, which have been ongoing since the summer.
While contract negotiations inevitably lend some question as to whether pay raises or changes in benefits may impact a budget, according to town manager Todd Odit, the contract signed by the selectboard and union representatives will not change any of the calculations for the police budget as it is currently drafted. The selectboard has been debating increasing the number of budgeted officers from five to six, but the calculation for what each officer might cost will not change.
The contract lays out a pay schedule that starts with a base wage of $34 an hour. This puts the Hinesburg department fairly in line with other Chittenden County towns and their own police forces. According to various job postings, towns range in starting pay from around $30 in Winooski to over $37 in Burlington. That includes a $34 starting wage in Williston and just over $31 an hour in South Burlington.
For departments across Vermont, successful contract negotiations can represent a renewed ability to vie for officers. The state is currently in a police shortage, with active postings in communities across the county that have been open for months or longer. If an officer isn’t happy with their position, it’s not difficult to find another.
Right now, Hinesburg only has three officers, including interim police chief Frank Bryan, of the five it has budgeted. In October, in outlining a departmental case for an increased budget, Bryan advocated to increase the base pay to $36 an hour as well as for additional officers.
“The more we overwork these guys, the more likely they are to say, ‘hey, I can probably make just as much money, if not more money in another town,’” Bryan said. He added that increases to the budget and base pay would not only help the town retain officers, but hire new ones.
There are other elements to the new contract that might be appealing to an incoming officer. For one, there is the possibility for a sign-on bonus of up to $10,000. Additionally, come July, Hinesburg’s officers will have four hours of flexible unpaid leave every month which can be used for things such as attending a child’s parent-teacher conference or bringing an elder to a doctor’s appointment. The officers will also have a labor-management committee to address workplace issues outside of union negotiations.
Along with the budget discussions, this contract is also coming into effect as Hinesburg searches for a new police chief. The town hired consultants to conduct a search for applicants and brought on two community members to give feedback on the process. As of Jan. 7, Odit said the town had entered the second round of interviews with candidates.
Odit has long contended that stable leadership is imperative to attracting and retaining officers. Should a new chief soon be found, in conjunction with the new union contract, the town may be well positioned to start trying to fill out its roster — whether or not the selectboard approves a budget decision that increases the town’s total officer count from five to six.

Many teenagers wallpaper their bedrooms with pinups of hot celebrities. Jessie Diggins, the most-awarded U.S. cross-country skier in history, instead tacked up an “Endless Winter” poster of a less-recognized hero: Vermonter Bill Koch, the first American Nordic racer to win an Olympic medal.
“He looked like he was having fun,” Diggins, who grew up in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb of Afton, Minnesota, recently recalled of the athlete-in-action shot. “It was the pure joy of life. That for me is what it’s all about.”
Moving to the Green Mountain State in 2012, a 20-year-old Diggins joined Stratton’s SMS T2 elite training team in hopes of following in Koch’s footsteps.

“I took a blind leap of faith as this young, naive total nobody when I moved out here,” she said in an interview.
Fourteen years later, Diggins — currently ranked the globe’s No. 1 female cross-country skier, with Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals and three overall-season World Cups — is set to wrap up her racing career this March after her fourth and final Winter Games.
“Her world-class engine, her unique combination of fearlessness and vulnerability, and her willingness to tell the world about her frailties is what has made Diggins an icon to plenty of people,” the New York Times wrote in its report on her pending retirement.
For all her stratospheric success, Diggins remains down-to-earth. Take her turn as a de facto cater-waiter when she crushed bags of ice into a beverage tub at a recent $100-a-plate Stratton dinner in her honor.
“This community really took me in,” the 34-year-old said. “I honestly believe this is the best place in the world to train. You feel really supported, and I’m able to get all the things that I need to learn and grow.”
It’s why Diggins keeps finding ways to give back.
‘A whole different story’
Diggins, born in the pre-digital days of 1991, doesn’t have a trope childhood memory of skiing before walking. Instead, she first saw Nordic racing on a VHS tape.
“I’m not going to lie,” she wrote in her 2020 memoir “Brave Enough.” “I wasn’t all that into it.”
Diggins changed her mind when she learned that winners left with a prize.
Joining the Minnesota Youth Ski League at age 3, Diggins ran out of levels to compete in by 10. Worried about juggling homework with practice six days a week, she almost didn’t join the cross-country team in seventh-grade, only to train with the varsity girls and, by her senior year of high school, score straight As and a state championship.
“On the outside, school and sports and dating were going great,” she wrote. “But on the inside, it was a whole different story.”
While classmates saw her as an all-American free spirit and picture of fitness, Diggins — watching her body morph from a girl to a woman — began to eye what she thought was fat. Her memoir recounts her struggle with eating disorders before a family intervention led her to the national Emily Program nonprofit treatment network.
“I’m so lucky to be here and be alive,” she wrote. “This secret, left to its own devices, might have killed me.”

Diggins earned entrance to the U.S. ski team and World Cup racing circuit in 2011, spurring her move to Vermont the next year. Training with Stratton’s SMS T2 crew, she soon found herself alongside one of its founders: Koch, who acquiesced to autographing her childhood poster.
Diggins would compete in the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, then win U.S. cross-country’s first-ever Olympic gold medal in 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and a silver (after a bout of food poisoning) and bronze in 2022 in Beijing, China.
In World Cup racing, Diggins became the first American woman to score the season Nordic title in 2021 (Koch became the first U.S. man to do so in 1982) and repeated the feat in 2023 and 2025.
Headed back to the Olympics, Diggins is plugging into social media to connect with fans in her home state of Minnesota, training site in Vermont and Boston suburb where she lives with her husband, financial analyst Wade Poplawski, in Massachusetts.
The skier happily lays claim to them all.
“I’ve been welcomed and adopted by all these different states,” she said. “It’s triple the love.”
‘I have a much bigger platform’
Diggins has yet to announce what she’ll do upon retiring after this March’s World Cup finals in Lake Placid, New York, although she’s noted a desire to start a family and already has after-hours partnerships with the Emily Program, the climate-advocating Protect Our Winters and the ski-instructing Share Winter Foundation.
For several summers, Diggins has joined the Bill Koch Youth Ski League for a fundraising hike up Stratton Mountain. Asked this past August for her biggest challenge, she told students about the 50-kilometer skate at last year’s world championship in Trondheim, Norway.
“I came in as a heavy medal favorite,” she recalled. “There were a lot of cameras and lights and pressure on me.”
Three minutes into the long race, she lagged behind a large field of competitors and realized she wasn’t going to win.
“I had to make a difficult decision. Do I drop out? Do I make some sort of excuse? Or do I finish because I love what I do?”
Determined to continue, Diggins pushed forward for the next two hours and 40 minutes.
“It was the hardest thing I’d ever done, but it was a really good experience,” she said of her 22nd-place finish. “When you win a race, you don’t really learn a whole lot, but when you lose, you get a chance to reexamine: Is this still fun? Do I still love training?”
In that moment, Diggins answered affirmatively, propelling her into this current end-on-a-high-note season.
“Sometimes,” she told students, “having a really, really bad day is what you need to continue to have good days.”

After Covid limited crowds at the 2022 Olympics, Diggins is set to travel with her family, friends and trademark face glitter to next month’s Winter Games in Italy. But she’s less interested in the destination than the journey there.
“You really have to enjoy the process of what you’re doing every day, because even if you win, the award ceremony will last 10 minutes — and it’ll be the best 10 minutes of your life — and then it will be over,” she said. “If you don’t love working hard, improving, and everything else that goes into it and you get out of it, then winning isn’t going to change your life.”
That’s why Diggins focuses on the present rather than the future.
“In racing, I want to cross the finish line and look back and say, ‘I used this chance and I gave it my all. That’s the approach I have with advocacy, too. I have a much bigger platform, and I’ve found myself thinking, ‘I have to do something with this.’ If there’s a way I can make a difference, then I want to try.”

At recent Stowe and Elmore-Morristown school board meetings, Lamoille South Supervisory Union Superintendent Ryan Heraty introduced the study to school board members and explained how the supervisory union might react to a slow enrollment decline over the next four years.
The study was produced by the Boston firm Statistical Forecasting LLC. In 2021, the supervisory union hired the New England Development Council to conduct a similar study, but the results were largely rejected due to controversial options for utilizing Lamoille South’s eight buildings, including shuttering some of them and rerouting students to different locations.
Heraty said the new report is focused more narrowly on student population and doesn’t make recommendations. Enrollment trends in local schools are frequently referenced in housing and affordability discussions throughout Lamoille County, particularly in Stowe, and the Stowe School board wanted a study that dovetails with the Town of Stowe’s Housing Needs Assessment.
“With all of the statewide discussion around consolidation and thinking about Vermont’s overall demographic trends, leaning towards an aging population, declining student enrollments — all of that — we want to think more local,” Heraty said. “How is this going to impact our schools here? And what do we see around housing trends that are going to impact our kindergarten, first and second grade enrollments so that we can start preparing for the future?”
Although overall town populations in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore have increased over the last decade, and are expected to increase in the future, according to the study, school enrollments in those towns have declined by 10%, from 1,592 in 2016 to 1,406 this year, after peaking at 1,694 students in 2017.
Throughout the Lamoille South Supervisory Union, kindergarten through fifth-grade classrooms have experienced the largest decline over the last eight years. Enrollment for that age group is currently at 544, a decrease of 132 students since 2016. According to the study, school enrollment for that age group is expected to dip over the next three years before leveling out at this year’s figure by 2030.
Enrollment for grades 6-8 has held relatively steady, declining by just 48 students over the last eight years, but that figure is expected to decline another 65 students by 2030.
High school enrollment district-wide has swung by nearly 100 students over the last eight years, ranging from 497 to 589, but figures for 2016 and 2025 are nearly even at 521 and 515, respectively. By 2030, that high school enrollment is expected to decline 12%.
While the study illustrated what many in Lamoille County’s housing and affordability circle already recognize — that a lack of viable housing and declining homestead rates are impacting local school enrollments — members of the Stowe school board said they aren’t necessarily concerned about declining enrollment.
“In my experience, it’s not unusual to see these ups and downs,” Stowe School Board Chair Tiffany Donza said.
In Stowe and Morristown, atypically large high school classes are currently graduating, inflating enrollment trends over the last few years, but elementary school enrollment has been low, partially explaining a projected enrollment decline by 2030 as those students move through the school system.
Prior to Act 60 and Act 68, both of which imposed a new funding formula for Vermont schools, Donza said enrollment wasn’t as much of a consideration. But the new formula started rewarding districts with more students and schools started watching their numbers closely, Donza said.
“It made it so students come with dollars,” Donza said, “Which is a disadvantage to Stowe for so many reasons.”
To understand enrollment trends, Heraty pointed to the median age of a community, saying those small elementary school classes coming up are indicative of greater housing and affordability issues facing families.
According to the study by Statistical Forecasting LLC, a housing boom from 1990 to 2009 benefitted a younger median age group who were moving to town. But as that group ages, and their children graduate, housing development has rapidly declined, and the median age has increased.
From 2000 to 2009, 1,207 homes were built in the Lamoille South Supervisory Union, almost twice as many as the next decade. From 2010 to 2020, there were only 666 homes built, according to the study. Stowe’s grand list has also increased significantly and the homestead rate has declined.
“The problem isn’t demand; it’s availability of affordable housing,” Heraty said. “It’s really hard to be in a position where you know that people want to be here and they want to live in our communities, but the housing just doesn’t exist for them.”
While Heraty is not sounding the alarm of declining enrollment, the Lamoille South Supervisory Union has begun making subtle changes to respond to the trend.
The supervisory union has already reduced central office positions and will reduce support staff positions this year.
“We don’t need to look at this as a negative,” Donza said. “We just need to plan for it and properly staff the schools.”

But recently, Landry picked up a second role as special envoy to Greenland.","Gov. Jeff Landry now has to balance his duties as Louisiana's governor with his new role as President Donald Trump's special envoy to Greenland. (Photo by Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Most of Jeff Landry’s predecessors as Louisiana governor never saw the need for a side hustle. For them, running the state was more than enough of a job. 
But Landry has made it clear he doesn’t want to be like other governors. His chutzpah might have been why the governor felt comfortable asking President Donald Trump to name him special envoy to Greenland on top of his duties overseeing Louisiana. 
Trump has made increasingly charged remarks in recent days about the United States taking control of Greenland, a self-ruling territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. In response, several European countries have announced their support for Greenland, with some launching military exercises to back up their stance. 

To what extent it is practical for the governor of Louisiana to be involved with the sensitive, international negotiations over Greenland that have much of Europe on edge while also managing one of the neediest states in the country remains to be seen.
“Most of us in Louisiana would think he is supposed to have a full-time job already,” said Terry Ryder, who served as general counsel for former Govs. Mike Foster and Kathleen Blanco and worked for former Govs. Buddy Roemer and Bobby Jindal. 

“Having been with multiple administrations, four administrations, there is always way more to do than any one governor can do,” Ryder said. 
Foreign affairs experts agreed it could be challenging for Landry to hold both roles at the same time. Special envoys, particularly ones handling high-profile issues for the White House, are often expected to devote their full attention to their assignment, they said. 
“Anytime you have two jobs, you are probably not doing either of them very well,” said Barbara Bodine, a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen who is now the director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University. 
“It is going to take a lot of his time out of state,” Bodine said of the envoy position. “There is no way you can be governor of Louisiana by Zoom.”
Landry’s staff declined to answer almost all questions emailed to them last week about the governor’s role as special envoy, including one regarding concerns the position could distract from his job as governor.

How much time will Landry spend on Greenland? His staff won’t say.
Landry isn’t being paid for his work as special envoy, his state staff said. But how much energy he will spend on Greenland isn’t clear.
Landry went to Washington, D.C., Thursday to participate in discussions that included the Trump administration, members of Congress and emissaries from Greenland and Denmark. He has also appeared in person on national television shows to talk about Greenland during a New York trip earlier this month. 
The governor’s office would not provide an estimate for how many hours Landry expects to spend per month on his Greenland role or to what extent he would be traveling for those duties.
Questions about whether Landry will receive federal staff or a D.C. office for his envoy role went unanswered by the governor’s staff. The U.S. Department of State and the White House press offices also didn’t answer questions about the federal resources Landry might receive. 
Foreign diplomacy experts said there are no set rules for an envoy, including whether the role is done on a part- or full-time basis. Historically, presidents have used special envoys because the positions allow for that type of flexibility. 
“It can be full time for a while, and then there is a pause in negotiations, and the envoy goes back to whatever they were doing before and just keeps a watchful eye on the matter,” James Bishop, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, Liberia and Somalia, said in an interview. 
Given Trump’s intense focus on Greenland, however, foreign policy experts said Landry, as special envoy, would normally receive some federal staff support at the U.S. State Department on a temporary basis.

Landry would also be expected to make negotiations over Greenland his top priority while the discussions are taking place, the experts said.

“A sitting governor who intends to keep his day job is unusual, to say the least, because one of the reasons that you have a special envoy is that you have an issue that is meddlesome, and you need to find somebody who can focus on that issue to try to resolve it,” said Bodine, who teaches about the role of special envoys in one of her classes at Georgetown.

In recent history, Bill Richardson is the only other governor who had a strong hand in foreign affairs while holding his state office. The Democrat worked as a “freelance diplomat” to get American hostages released while leading New Mexico from 2003-11, although he was never designated a special envoy for the president during that time. 

Unlike Landry, Richardson had significant experience in foreign relations before he became governor. He first helped free an American hostage in 1994 during a trip to North Korea that he took as a New Mexico congressman, and he served as President Bill Clinton’s ambassador to the United Nations in 1997-98.

Landry says he wants Greenland deals for Louisiana 
While no connection between Greenland and Louisiana is apparent, it hasn’t stopped Landry from trying to make one with the arctic island. 

“They tell me they like to hunt, they like to fish, they like to have a good time. I’m like, ‘Y’all belong in Louisiana,’” Landry said on the Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox News Radio this month. 

The governor has also taken great pains, even on national broadcasts, to say he will use his role as special envoy to Greenland to create business investment for Louisiana. 

“I can’t wait to have discussions with Greenland about the opportunities that we can do in Louisiana,” Landry said during an appearance on CNBC Squawk Box.
The Louisiana Economic Development agency, which is run by a Landry appointee, is not actively working on business deals in Greenland but would welcome those types of projects, according to a spokeswoman. 
“[W]e are excited about the future opportunities that Governor Landry’s new role brings,” Emma Wagner said for the agency in a written statement. 
Talk of mixing Louisiana’s business with his special envoy duties alarmed foreign policy experts interviewed for this story. They said the governor using a diplomatic role abroad to gin up investment for the state would create ethical concerns and possibly run afoul of federal law. 
“It could get messy if, for example, any company that has an office, much less a headquarters, in Louisiana that would benefit from mining, refining or shipping,” Bodine said. 
There have also been questions about whether Landry might be violating a Louisiana constitutional law that prohibits public officials from holding federal and state jobs at the same time. But Ryder, who worked for four governors as an attorney, said he doubts Landry’s unpaid role will raise concerns.

“I would say the less formal it is, the safer it is for him,” Ryder said. “There is nothing wrong with a governor helping the president of the United States.” 
Whether Landry’s Greenland assignment will be popular with Louisiana voters is another matter. Former Gov. Bobby Jindal saw his polling numbers tank while he started traveling frequently to raise money and generate support for his 2016 presidential campaign. 

Bernie Pinsonat, a Louisiana political consultant and polling expert, doubts Louisiana voters have paid much attention to the governor’s Greenland job. Landry’s approval ratings are already low, standing at 39% according to one recent poll, but won’t necessarily sink further because of the special envoy job, he said.

“I’ll guarantee you that if [Louisiana voters] think he’s too involved in national politics versus what he’s doing here, believe me, he’ll suffer,” the pollster said. “But I don’t think he’s anywhere near that.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BR.specialsession.110724_HS_1722-1024x998.jpg,,,2026-01-18 06:56:56.816249

Winthrop Rockefeller was the only Southern governor to hold a public memorial following the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination.
The indelible image of a white governor joining hands with Black mourners to sing “We Shall Overcome” was needed to heal a city that was just a couple hours away from where King was killed.
The moment was also a reminder of how Arkansas shines the best when its leaders find ways to highlight the importance of civil rights rather than shy away. Arkansas needs to find more avenues to do so, even in a hyperpartisan environment.
The state’s move nearly a decade ago to remove Robert E. Lee’s name from the state holiday honoring King was a step in the right direction. The joint holiday honoring the civil rights icon alongside the Confederate general had become an embarrassment for the state, especially as pictures of the state notices about the joint holiday gained traction on social media.
That embarrassment was enough for Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to add the issue to his legislative agenda and take the rare step of testifying before a legislative committee in favor of it.
The state has made other signs of progress, at least symbolically. 
The decision to replace one of the state’s statues in the U.S. Capitol with one of Daisy Bates, the civil rights leader who mentored the nine students who integrated Central High School, was a necessary statement to be made in a building where statues of Confederate leaders can still be found.

A lesser but still significant step was taken by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signing legislation creating a specialty license plate honoring the Central High historic site.
But elsewhere there have been stumbles and missed opportunities. That includes the effort to no longer honor the Confederacy with one of the stars on Arkansas’ flag, a proposal that failed before a legislative committee. Similarly, a bid to end the state’s commemoration of “Confederate Flag Day” passed the House in 2021 but failed before a Senate panel.
The current political climate isn’t encouraging for another attempt at these measures. President Donald Trump has defended Confederate figures and symbols, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has taken moves to restore the names of Confederate generals to military bases.
Sanders has echoed Trump’s rhetoric complaining about “indoctrination” in the classroom, with a law she signed prohibiting critical race theory from being taught in public schools that’s sparked a legal fight. The prohibition has also drawn criticism from civil rights groups who say the restriction threatens to whitewash history. A federal appeals court panel last year allowed the law to be enforced in the state. 
Arkansas is running out of opportunities to properly honor that history instead of engaging in fights over it. Many of the leaders and key figures of the Civil Rights Movement are gone, including Claudette Colvin, who died last week. Two of the Little Rock Nine have died, leaving only seven of those civil rights icons left. 
Next year marks 70 years since the Little Rock desegregation crisis, and it may be one of the last times that an anniversary can be commemorated with most of the Little Rock Nine on hand. The sad truth is that despite the symbolic progress that’s been made, Arkansas remains a state where symbols and monuments of the Confederacy significantly outnumber tributes to the state’s civil rights icons.
It’s easy to echo talking points about heritage and much harder to admit that true patriotism requires embracing a full history. It requires elevating civil rights heroes, and acknowledging a country and state’s shameful past. 
Finding a way to do so in this environment might be the best monument.

The Legislature will reconvene for a three-day special session on Wednesday. (Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers plan to hold a three-day special session starting Wednesday, but it’s still unclear if they’ll discuss any bills other than five focused on the federal Rural Health Transformation Program.
Legislative leaders will decide Tuesday afternoon if additional bills will be allowed. That means the public will have a tight window to provide input on potential legislation. Gov. Kelly Armstrong will deliver a State of the State address at 10 a.m. Wednesday.
What we know
At least five bills will be introduced, focused on the federal rural health care funding, the reason Armstrong called the special session. One is an appropriations bill to approve spending $199 million of federal funding this year and authorizing $200 million anticipated for next year. A hearing is set for 10:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Four health policy bills also will be introduced. The one likely to get the most debate would expand the prescriptive authority of pharmacists, which proponents say could make it easier for rural North Dakotans to get treated for common conditions. A hearing for that bill is scheduled for 1 p.m. Wednesday. 

North Dakota Monitor special session coverage

Lawmakers also will consider a bill that would require K-12 students to take the presidential fitness test; a bill to require one-hour of continuing education for doctors related to healthy eating; and a bill to include physician assistants in a state licensure compact.
Hearings on those policy bills are scheduled between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Wednesday. For specific information, including links to submit written testimony, visit the committee hearing schedule. Some written testimony is due as early as 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Lawmakers also will accept public testimony in person and online, though they prioritize in-person testimony.
Lawmakers are proposing the policy bills in order to fulfill criteria for additional federal funding through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid’s grant application process. Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, warned any substantial modifications to those bills come with the risk of losing some of the state’s $199 million grant. 
“If any of those four policy bills do not pass in the form that we have them, or if they’re significantly changed from the form that CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) wanted us to draft as policies, then we could see reductions in funding or clawbacks of that funding,” said Bekkedahl, who will co-chair a joint Appropriations Committee during the special session. 


What we don’t know
The Legislative Management committee will meet at 1 p.m. Tuesday to hear pitches from lawmakers about other legislation for the special session. Lawmakers will have five minutes to explain their bill draft and why it’s an emergency that can’t wait until 2027.
We don’t know all of the topics that could be addressed. Those bill drafts are expected to become public on the legislative website on Monday on the Legislative Management meeting agenda.
One bill that will be pitched during that meeting is a proposal to provide free school meals to all K-12 students, similar to a ballot measure that’s circulating. It will be up to the bipartisan committee of legislative leaders to decide if the bill advances to the full Legislature on Wednesday.
If the committee does not advance a bill, a lawmaker could still attempt to introduce it from the Senate or House floor. The bill would need support from at least two-thirds of the members to be introduced.
How the public can participate
All legislative proceedings, including the governor’s speech, are open to the public and livestreamed on the legislative website.

Affordable, quality child care is one of the smartest investments we can make as a state. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Emilie Tenenbaum and Sharron Harrington: Why Vermont must stay committed to child care.","This commentary is by Emilie Tenenbaum, the executive director of Let’s Grow Kids Action Network, and Sharron Harrington, the executive director of the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children.
Across political lines and communities, most Vermonters agree that young families should be able to afford to live and work here. 
The good news is that the long-term investments in child care arising from Act 76 (Vermont’s landmark child care law passed in 2023) are moving us toward this shared vision. 
Early childhood connects to many of Vermont’s biggest policy challenges, from affordability to school readiness. We know that investing in quality child care leads to better results down the road, including improved health outcomes and higher graduation and employment rates. 
Since 2023, Vermont’s bold investments in child care access and affordability have begun to reshape what’s possible. 
In the last two years, more than 5,000 additional children and their families have accessed tuition assistance to help pay for quality child care. Over 100 new child care programs have opened, creating 1,700 new spaces for children and 400 new early childhood educator jobs. 
Parents tell us these changes have helped them afford to stay in Vermont, participate in the workforce, and start or grow their families. Investing in child care delivers results that every Vermont policymaker wants to see and that Vermonters deserve.
It’s essential that lawmakers stay committed to investments proven to work. To put it bluntly: while our momentum is real, continued progress is not guaranteed unless our state remains committed to child care. 
That’s why we are focused this year on the following policy priorities: protecting the child care funding driving Vermont’s success; strengthening our early childhood educator workforce; increasing child care access and affordability; and fixing delays in fingerprinting and background checks, which are critical for safety and staffing. 
Together, our organizations represent more than a decade of statewide coalition building. Our recommendations come from ongoing engagement with families, early childhood educators, employers and partners.
First and foremost, we must protect the funding driving these systems-level improvements. Act 76 created more than $100 million in long-term public investment, which was supported by Vermont businesses and citizens because they recognize that affordable, quality child care is one of the smartest investments we can make as a state. 
The numbers show it’s paying off. As lawmakers craft the budget for fiscal year 2027, funding for child care must not be diverted.
The continued success of our child care commitment depends on strengthening and growing our early childhood educator workforce. Children have better outcomes in school and beyond when their earliest experiences are supported by a qualified early childhood educator.
Expanding access for children only happens when there are enough qualified early childhood educators to care for them. The best way to do this is to establish professional recognition for early childhood educators. 
The Early Childhood Educator Profession Bill (introduced as S.206) creates professional recognition for more than 6,500 educators working in child care programs outside our public schools. 
It is workforce-informed, workforce-strengthening legislation that addresses regulatory gaps and creates a transparent, supportive system for parents, educators, hiring programs and the public. It connects educators’ accountability and compensation to their qualifications — just like any other profession.
It professionalizes a workforce without which our state cannot function, and it does so while supporting, rather than displacing, the talented educators already doing the work. 
As we work toward accessible, affordable, quality child care for every family that needs it, we’ll continue to advocate for improvements. For some families earning more than the tuition assistance threshold, affordable child care still remains out of reach.
Meanwhile, measures improving child care quality are clearly working. Programs helping early childhood educators earn credentials and degrees are extremely popular; training, coaching, and targeted supports are improving child care quality statewide. 
Lawmakers must continue to increase access, lower costs, improve quality, and expand programs that help recruit and retain educators — especially in rural regions and for families with unique needs, like nonstandard work hours.
They also need to fix Vermont’s fingerprint and background check delays. Child safety depends on efficient, thorough criminal background checks for anyone working in child care. The current lengthy delays worsen staffing shortages across child care and afterschool programs. 
Vermont’s commitment to child care is a source of statewide pride. We must protect and strengthen that commitment: keep growing child care programs, keep strengthening our early childhood educator workforce, and keep improving outcomes for children, families, and our economy. 
Vermont’s future depends on what we do next.

But some concerns linger about privacy issues.","Drivers who speed down Route 66 on the border of Middletown and Middlefield are getting hit with an automatic $50 fine. The second time they’re caught in a month costs $75. 
Middletown is one of the first municipalities in Connecticut to install speed cameras in town — but it won’t be the last. After the Connecticut legislature passed a law in 2023 allowing municipalities to install red light and speed cameras and collect fines from drivers who break the law, cities and towns have been presenting extensive plans to the state Department of Transportation in bids to procure their own monitoring devices. So far, 11 have had plans approved and three more are under consideration.
The 2023 law says that municipalities can install cameras that will capture drivers who speed and run red lights. After an initial 30-day period of written warnings, drivers who drive more than 10 mph over the speed limit or run a red light will be issued a fine. 
According to the Middletown police, the area on Route 66 near the camera is a hotspot for speeders. The limit is 35 mph, but the police have caught drivers going more than twice as fast. 
Middletown Police Chief Erik Costa said he would need significantly more police officers to catch as many people speeding as the camera was able to. He said it has also “changed the culture” of driving in that part of the city, where there are multiple apartment buildings and large retail stores. 

Towns that want to install speed cameras have to create plans that include quite a bit of information, including data on traffic stops and crashes in the areas where the proposed cameras would be installed. 
According to Middletown’s plan, the police department made 455 traffic stops over the last three years in the area on Route 66 where the camera was to be located.
From the time the camera went live in July through December 2025, the department issued about 46,000 citations for the same area. As of early December, the department had collected $1.84 million in fines out of a total of $2.8 million issued, according to Costa. 
“ The force multiplier that the cameras take care of is tremendous,” Costa said. 
Costa said the cameras have allowed him to send his police officers to patrol other “hot spots” in town. 
The town recently installed two more traffic cameras, near Spencer and Moody elementary schools. Costa said the areas near those schools have no lighting or stop signs for controlling traffic. The roads slope downward and the intersections are at odd angles, making the cameras necessary. 
“ We really are focused on maintaining good speeds in that area so we don’t have any tragedy and especially during the transition of our buses and family pickup for students,” he said.

‘The only thing … that has actually worked’
So far, the state has approved traffic cameras in 11 municipalities — New Haven, Middletown, Washington, Beacon Falls, Marlborough, Milford, Stratford, Fairfield, Greenwich, Stamford and Wethersfield. 
The municipality of Washington, a town in Litchfield County with a population of about 3,600 in 2021, was the first to install cameras. The plan submitted to the state said because Washington shares a resident state trooper with surrounding towns, the town needs additional resources in order to enforce traffic laws.  
Richard Inniamo, Washington’s resident state trooper, said in early December that the town’s three cameras had issued upwards of 13,400 citations since May of last year. 
“People are slowing down for them, and that’s all we really wanted,” Inniamo said. He added that where people used to travel more than 20 mph over the speed limit, they are now staying within 10 mph to 15 mph of the speed limit. 
According to Jim Bretton, Washington’s first selectman, in early December the town had collected roughly 75% of the $662,000 it has issued in fines. Bretton agreed with Inniamo that the cameras have slowed down drivers. He said citations peaked in June, a month after the cameras were installed. Since then, the number has dropped.  
“Honestly, it’s the only thing to date that has actually worked,” Bretton said, adding that the town had tried installing speed bumps, and offering more education, to no avail. 
Bretton said the town saw the cameras as a way to improve pedestrian safety, a top concern.
“As a rural community, we’ve got people out constantly with their children with their pets walking the roads. It was virtually every road was a speedway,” he said. 
Data from Marlborough shows that the two cameras installed on North Main Street caught 8,600 speeding events between July and December 2025 and issued 6,500 citations. According to a presentation that Town Manager David Porter gave to the Capitol Region Council of Governments, the percentage of people driving over the speed limit dropped significantly when the cameras were installed and continued to drop over the course of the first few months they were active.

“Speed cameras have been enormously successful at making that road much safer,” Porter told the Board of Selectmen at a meeting on Dec. 16. 
But Porter also said that state rules requiring the data to be erased after 30 days made it difficult to keep track of repeat offenders. He said he would like to see the time limit increased to 60 or 90 days. 
So far, he said, the town has collected $186,924 after paying fees to the camera vendor. 
The towns have contracted with a variety of vendors to provide the cameras and software. A purchase order from August 2024 shows that Middletown paid about $3,900 to the firm Traffic Logix for a speed camera. The town paid $4,000 to Dacra Tech for the camera’s operating system and will also pay the firm a monthly fee based on the number of citations and warnings issued: $13.50 per citation and $6 per warning. 
Costa said the cost of the speed cameras will be funded by fees from violations. Under the 2023 law, fees collected from traffic violations must go either toward paying for the speed and red light cameras or toward transportation infrastructure.
Privacy concerns
Privacy concerns have been raised, not only with the use of red light and speed cameras but with all surveillance technology.
Late last year, the ACLU called for a temporary ban on automatic license plate readers out of concerns the information the devices collect could be used by federal agents for immigration enforcement or to penalize people seeking abortions or transgender care. 
Although Connecticut’s law strictly regulates the way data collected by speed and red light cameras can be used, Dan Barrett, the legal director of the ACLU of Connecticut, said the organization is concerned about their use. 
“The pervasive surveillance means that so much more evil is possible,” Barrett said. 
State law mandates that any data collected by speed or red light cameras can only be used to track those violations. It can’t be used, for example, to track someone who has committed a crime. 
Still, some municipal officials, while assessing the need for the cameras, have expressed concerns about potential collateral effects.
In September, the town of East Hartford approved a detailed ordinance regulating all surveillance technologies, including license plate readers, speed and red light cameras and drones. Don Bell, the town council vice chair, said at the council’s September meeting that the strict state regulations around speed and red light camera data helped quell his fears that the program might overcharge or discriminate against certain residents. 
Still, he said, he felt some “discomfort” about the use of the devices.
“We know that surveillance technology, good intentions or not, often disproportionately impacts communities of color. As one of the most diverse communities in the state, throughout this process I’ve worried if I might unintentionally hurt East Hartford by supporting any ordinance that opens the door for new technology,” Bell said. 
The ordinance places regulations around surveillance cameras that are similar to the ones the state places on speed and red light cameras, limiting the way the data can be used and how long it can be kept. The ordinance also prohibits the use of facial recognition technology. 
The town has not yet proposed installing any red light or speed cameras. 
People who receive citations are able to contest them and ask for a hearing. There are six valid reasons under the law for overturning violations: if a traffic light was broken, a driver had to get out of the way of an emergency vehicle, a driver was directed to ignore the traffic light by an officer, the camera was calibrated incorrectly, the vehicle in question had been stolen or the vehicle was an emergency vehicle. 
The citations are civil violations, meaning that drivers will not receive points on their licenses, and the violations will not be reported to insurance companies. 
New Haven
Connecticut’s largest cities have also started to invest in the technology. 
The New Haven town council voted in November to approve a contract with the firm NovoaGlobal to install traffic cameras. The city applied to install 19 red light and speed cameras at various intersections. The state Department of Transportation approved 15 of the 19 requested. 
Overall, New Haven was the site of 20,000 crashes between 2020 and 2022, including about 250 in which someone was seriously injured and 58 in which someone was killed, according to the plan New Haven submitted to DOT.
Several of the sites the city chose for the cameras were locations where pedestrians had been struck and killed by motor vehicles in the last five years. 
At one of the intersections, where Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd crosses Church Street, more than 70 crashes occurred between 2020 and 2022. In 2024, a bicyclist was hit by a garbage truck and killed at the intersection, and a pedestrian was injured during a crash in which one vehicle ran a red light. 
Mayor Justin Elicker said the traffic cameras were one tool in a larger plan to curb traffic accidents in New Haven. He said the city has doubled the number of officers assigned to traffic enforcement and is installing speed bumps and modifying roads to slow drivers down. The city is also installing cameras on school buses that record drivers passing buses when they’re stopped. 
“In general, there’s still dangerous driving, but we have seen a lot of progress overall in the city,” Elicker said. 
Elicker said the cameras were an advantage not just because they were able to monitor traffic 24/7 but because certain intersections made it difficult for a police officer to pull someone over even if the officer happened to witness a violation. 
“ The cameras are not just helpful to have more enforcement eyes on the street but also to keep our officers and community members safe,” Elicker said. 
Hartford
While the state has not yet approved its application, the Hartford city council voted in November in favor of a plan to install traffic cameras at 11 locations near schools in the city.
According to the proposal the city submitted to the state Department of Transportation, multiple pedestrians had been killed at the potential camera site on Main Street near S.A.N.D. Academy in the past two years. Other potential locations were places where drivers had put students at risk, like at the Parkville Community School. 
“School staff report that students crossing Park Street near New Park Avenue have experienced near misses with speeding drivers,” the report noted. 
In an area on Wethersfield Avenue near Burr Middle School and Bulkeley High School, more than 100 crashes had taken place within the prior three years, according to the proposal.   
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam told CT Mirror that the city saw the 11 cameras as a pilot program. He said that focusing on the schools would improve multiple neighborhoods across the city and prioritize the safety of children. 
“ I’ve heard time and time again from families about the toll that reckless driving has taken. And as we all know, it’s gotten so much worse after COVID,” he said. “ We want to be able to have residents feel safe in every neighborhood that they’re in across the city and driving is clearly a major public safety concern.” 
“I think actually that [the cameras] will disproportionately help victims of color, and I think we’re going to find a mix of folks from outside of Hartford who are perpetuating many of these traffic violations,” he said. 
Bridgeport
Other cities remain skeptical. On Jan. 6, members of the Bridgeport city council’s Public Safety Committee gathered to hear a presentation raising the possibility of installing speed cameras at several intersections in the city. 
Councilwoman Maria Valle said her goddaughter had been struck at an intersection on East Main Street. She told the Connecticut Mirror that she supported the idea of speed cameras because “something’s got to give.” She mentioned flowers that would appear at intersections, signifying that someone had been killed there.  
“If it’s going to help our residents, why not?” she said. 
But others said they wanted to see the money used to bolster resources that were already suffering from funding shortages in the city. 
“ We are in a place right now that we don’t even have officers to solve crime,” said councilwoman Eneida Martinez, who questioned whether the city would have enough personnel to monitor the cameras, as well as the drones the city has approved to alert law enforcement and first responders to emergencies. 
Constance Vickers, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff, told the council members that she felt the cameras would improve safety.
“ I live right on one of these intersections. I see accidents every day. I walked to work through one of them,” she said.

Slowing people down
It may be too soon to say whether the municipal cameras have reduced the number of vehicular fatalities in the state.
The Connecticut Transportation Institute at the University of Connecticut found that last year, 270 traffic-related deaths were recorded across the state. That was a notable drop from the previous three years, where deaths ranged from 308 to 366 people. 
Eric Jackson, the institute’s executive director, said there had been a renewed focus among police departments on ticketing speeders and aggressive drivers. 
“It could just be the talk of automated enforcement has people slowing down,” Jackson said. 
While the number of drivers and passengers in vehicles who were killed was lower in 2025 compared to previous years, the number of pedestrians who died in crashes remained relatively consistent.
Jackson said the numbers reflect a nationwide trend of pedestrian deaths increasing over the last decade, a trend bolstered by increased aggressive driving during the pandemic. He said the crashes have become more deadly for pedestrians as average vehicle sizes increase. 
Speed cameras can lead to improved safety at particular hot spots, Jackson said. He said cities and towns should also be thinking about road infrastructure, providing wide crosswalks, installing poles and bump-out curbs and making sure there is enough lighting. 
In 2023, the state Department of Transportation ran a pilot program placing speed cameras at five work zones. The program issued more than 24,900 warning notices but issued fewer than 750 fines. A 2024 report to state lawmakers found that the cameras reduced vehicles’ speed in the work zone — in some cases, up to 18%. 
“Based on the results of the pilot, and what we heard directly from the men and women on these job sites, yes, the pilot was a success. Speeds dropped and workers felt safer when these devices were active,” Josh Morgan, spokesperson for the department, said in an email. 
The state resumed the program in the fall of 2025, although it has not yet begun enforcement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0115_SR_SpeedCamera_071-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 05:56:12.338849

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)What if an authority figure directed you to pull a lever that delivered a painful shock to an unseen victim?
If you’re like most people, you’d do it. And you’d keep doing it, at the urging of that authority figure, despite the howls of pain from the poor sap on the other side of the wall.
You’ve probably heard of the Milgram experiment, in which a Yale psychologist faked electric shocks to study the willingness of ordinary people to obey orders in conflict with their personal conscience. Nobody was really hurt, because no shocks were delivered and the yowls of pain came from actors. We’ll return to Milgram shortly, but let me explain how I got to thinking about the famous experiment in the first place.
It was Gov. Laura Kelly’s last State of the State address, delivered Tuesday.
“Kansans are the most civil, decent people on earth,” she declared.
I couldn’t agree more. But our nature is part of the problem.
Kelly, a Democrat, was trying to make a point about civility and bipartisanship in politics. She urged Kansas lawmakers, the supermajority of whom were Republicans, not to let the loudest and most extreme viewpoints “drown out the voices of the vast majority of Kansans, who want to see us work together.”
Problem is, the Legislature has ignored what the vast majority of Kansans want for years — and right-wing extremism already rules. That’s why we don’t have legalized pot or Medicaid expansion. About 65% of Kansans support recreational marijuana, and 74% think expanding Medicaid would help rural hospitals stay in business. Those figures are from the Fall 2025 Kansas Speaks public opinion survey by the Docking Institute for Public Affairs at Fort Hays State University.
Much of the daylight between what Kansans want and what we get is because of historic GOP majorities in the Kansas House and Senate, which routinely block any measure that might give joy or comfort to anybody but the rich. But some of the blame belongs to a collective culture in which Kansans are so desperate to be polite and cooperative, and not to be regarded as different, that we’ll defer to power even when we shouldn’t.
Not all Kansans are like this. I’m not. My journalistic training and the books I’ve read and the friends I’ve made have allowed me to transcend Sunflower bashfulness. But it hasn’t absolved my guilt about being different.
There’s no guilt like Kansas guilt, and it lurks inside us like a vestigial organ from our founding. Although admitted as a free state on the eve of the Civil War 165 years ago, Kansas throbs with the political memory of the struggle that made us bleed. In our collective conscience there nags the worry we haven’t lived up to our promise, that even though we helped end the stain of slavery we still struggle with other deadly civic sins. From racism to hunger to inequality, the job remains unfinished. Nobody today remembers the state’s founding, but every living and reasoning Kansan takes their catechism from the pages of history.
We Kansans are not only a civil lot, as a whole, but a decent lot.

My definition of decency is behaving in a moral way, whether or not it conforms to accepted notions of respectability. You probably know a neighbor or a friend who has put their own self-interest aside to help you or someone else, and that’s the kind of approach Kelly specifically mentioned. Perhaps you donate food in a blessing box or give what you can to charity. But let me give you an historic example of Kansas decency in a time of trial.
During World War II, hundreds of thousands of captured German soldiers were sent to POW camps across America. Some of these camps were in Kansas, including one that held 100 or so prisoners at Peabody.
The POWs were billeted in town at a warehouse that had been turned into a prison. During the day the POWs were sent out to work, for meager pay, at surrounding farms, as long as the work was not dangerous and didn’t involve war production. POW labor helped alleviate a wartime manpower shortage at farms across Kansas.
“At first only the Mennonites invited the prisoners to work,” recalled Marian Franz, in the Mennonite Weekly Review in 1989. She had been an adolescent farm girl during the war. “Then others, observing the comfortable arrangement, employed them also.”
Franz wrote that she was more afraid of the armed U.S. guards than of the German prisoners. The Mennonites are historically known as pacifists and, during the war, many were conscientious objectors and given alternative service.
The German worked hard, were grateful for the quality of the food they were given, and even had a little time for hobbies such as sketching or whittling. The commander of the Peabody camp obtained soccer balls and boxing gloves for the prisoners. Even the guards who accompanied the prisoners to the field work developed a degree of trust.
“The original tension between the U.S. and German soldiers was relaxed by the hospitality that our Mennonite home and community extended equally to friend and foe,” Franz remembered. “As time went on fewer guards accompanied the prisoners. The guards no longer brought the guns into the house at mealtime. On occasion we sang together at the piano.”
Not everyone liked how well the German prisoners were being treated. Every time an American casualty list was printed in the papers, there were calls for some POWs to be executed. Once, when three farm women drove prisoners back their barracks in Peabody, they were unexpectedly met by a group of politicians, army officials and newspapermen who were conducting an official inspection. Wharton Hoch, a newspaper editor from nearby Marion, was particularly incensed. He condemned the practice of women transporting prisoners without guards, according to the Kansas City Times.
The commander of the four prison camps in central Kansas immediately put an end to the practice.
“When these prisoners first came to Kansas there was an urge on the part of the people to kill them,” the commander, Col. H.L. Shafer, told a town meeting, as reported by the Times. “Now there is a tendency to swing just as far the other way and fraternize with them. Treat them fairly but as prisoners.”
Franz became friends with one of the prisoners, Berthold Schwarz, who had been captured in North Africa after Erwin Rommel’s defeat. He returned to Germany at the end of the war. In 1988, Franz was reunited with Schwarz during a trip to Europe.
“It was evident the prisoner-of-war experience was emotional for Schwarz,” she wrote. “He pored over photos of how the Peabody prison looks today.”
I didn’t know of the German POW camp at Peabody until October, when I visited the historical society there and was surprised to see a wooden model of what appeared to be a twin-engine Heinkel bomber. It had been carved out of scrap wood by a German POW. There I also learned of “Spoils of Victory” by Daniel Markowitz, a 2025 novel about the German POW experience among Mennonite families in Kansas.
Franz, who for 24 years as director of the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund lobbied Congress unsuccessfully to establish the right of conscientious objectors not to fund wars, died in 2006. She was 76.
I’m not a pacifist. But I am worried about our current blundering into war, the increasing threat of nuclear annihilation, and the loss of the stabilizing influence of American power on the world stage.
I’m also not naive enough to think German prisoners during World War II were treated well in Kansas just because it was the right thing to do. Had they been Japanese prisoners, they likely would have been treated far worse, as were the Japanese Americans in the concentration camps at Manzanar and elsewhere. Also, there is the problem that the German POWs, decent people by appearances, were part of the Nazi regime. Hardcore Nazis, including SS officers, were barred from farm work, but even Rommel’s rank-and-file soldiers were fighting for fascism.
Which brings me back to Milgram and his famous experiment.
“Obedience, as a determinant of behavior, is of particular relevance to our time,” Milgram wrote in his 1974 book detailing his experiment. “It has been reliably established that from 1933 to 1945 millions of innocent people were systematically slaughtered on command. Gas chambers were built, death camps were guarded, daily quotas of corpses were produced with the same efficiency as the manufacture of appliances. These inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person, but they could only have been carried out on a massive scale if a very large number of people obeyed orders.”
In 1960, Milgram devised the test, in which subjects were paid $4 an hour to administer the shocks, ostensibly to study the effect of pain on learning. The subjects were the ones with their fingers on the button. There was an “experimenter” who directed the shocks be increased while a “learner” supposedly tried to memorize word pairs, but the learners were actually actors who were in on the scheme.
Milgram found that two-thirds of subjects turned their machines up to the maximum of 450 volts when told to do so, despite the cries of pain from the learner. Perhaps more disturbing, every subject was willing to inflict some pain.
There has been ample criticism of Milgram’s work, particularly from psychologist Gina Perry, who in 2013 wrote “Behind the Shock Machine,” in which she interviews the original subjects and concludes Milgram may have overstated his percentages and erred in his broad generalizations. Yet, Milgram’s results have been replicated so many times that his conclusions remain substantially valid.
The real unease with Milgram’s experiments, I think, lies in the central question that drove him to experiment in the first place: Why are otherwise decent people disposed to obey orders that result in cruelty, suffering and death to their fellow human beings?
It is the essential question of civilization.
On presidential Election Day in 2024 I visited several polling places in my town and observed, from a safe and legal distance, as scores of my neighbors cast their votes. The polling places for some of the precincts, like mine, were churches. For others it was a public building, including the municipal auditorium. It all went smoothly enough, with voters behaving cordially and the volunteer poll workers doing their jobs with efficiency and dedication. As I watched, I recalled the Trolley Problem, a thought exercise in which you’re given the choice to kill one person in order to save five.
But I was wrong. What I was watching was akin to the Milgram experiment in real life.
No experimenter was giving orders to shock, but each person voting had the memory of authority figures — politicians, preachers, activists, family members and even journalists — crowding the booth with them. There were no fake electrical shocks or cries of pain, but there were real cultural and economic shocks and actual pain for unseen human beings radiating beyond the ballot.
We can think for ourselves, but often we do not. Every day is an actual Milgram experiment. The key to casting a moral vote is to seek reliable information, find the moral compass within yourself and act accordingly.
Failure leads to severe moral dissonance.
Just take Coldwater. This Kansas town overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump and Kris Kobach. Yet, as Kansas Reflector Opinion Editor Clay Wirestone wisely points out, they also mourned the loss of their mayor, Joe Ceballos, who could face deportation after Attorney General Kobach filed fraud charges against him for voting without being a citizen.
Much of the rest of the country must be experiencing similar political vertigo. ICE is a murderous American masked police, the GOP-packed Supreme Court is poised to render yet more Dred Scott-like bad decisions, we’ve abducted the president of Venezuela and we’re risking the collapse of NATO by threatening to conquer Greenland.
Welcome to the new world disorder.
Most Kansans are civil and decent humans. But we need leaders, elected and otherwise, who will clearly denounce the moral collapse at the center of this political chaos, not call for more compromise or deference to authority. Now is the time not for civility, but for civil disobedience.

Wegman’s supermarkets are using artificial intelligence and facial recognition? Outrageous! Alert the authorities! Cancel dinner!
Never mind the fact that on your way to shop you passed by dozens of video cameras and license plate readers. Or the fact that your cellphone has been constantly pinging your location enroute. Attention shoppers: you have no privacy!



Supermarkets are not alone in their use of this tech.  CVS, Home Depot, Macy’s, Target and Walmart do, too.  They say it’s just for controlling theft (of which there is plenty), but I’m not buying it.  By knowing your face they know everything about you:  your online shopping history, social media posts and credit history.
With digital price shelf tags that update in seconds, the only real question is how long before the algorithm decides your face looks like it can afford to pay another 12 percent.
Even turning on your cellphone may involve recognizing your face. Calling Customer Service? They may use voice recognition or even measure your tone of voice for signs of stress and frustration.
Airlines can deduce the reason for that last-minute trip you’re booking.  If it’s for a funeral, critics wonder if they might charge you more because you absolutely need to travel ASAP.  Airlines insist they’d never raise fares because you’re flying to a funeral.  Of course not. They just happened to notice you booked one way, last minute, to Des Moines… right after your phone searched for “obituary.”
And when you do board your flight, it may be facial recognition scans that will get you on the plane, not just a boarding pass. Coming home from overseas your quick processing will depend on facial scanning by Customs and Border Patrol.
Did you buy anything overseas you didn’t declare? With a few (pesky but legal) steps, your credit card statement becomes a travel diary, complete with timestamps, locations, and a helpful list of things you “forgot” to declare.
Want to catch a Knicks or Rangers game at Madison Square Garden? Facial recognition may deny you access, even with a ticket, if you’re a lawyer who’s sued them in the past. Justice may be blind, but MSG security definitely isn’t.
In your car your face is less visible so companies like Flock depend on your license plates, color and model of your vehicle to ID you. That’s why cops are cracking down on obscured or “ghost” plates used to avoid tolls, the automotive equivalent of shoplifting. Here’s a site showing Flock cameras near you.
Flock also can also deploy drones to keep an eye on things… useful in law enforcement but a bit too scary for the Bridgeport City Council which, in a rare moment of restraint, overwhelmingly rejected a $500,000 contract covered by state funding.
Bridgeport joins a growing list of cities rejecting Flock out of privacy and data-sharing concerns. Those cities claim that Flock does more than scan license plates, but also the faces of protestors. And shares its data with the Feds.
Imagine the possibilities.
In China facial recognition identifies jay-walking pedestrians, shames them publicly and gives them demerits. Rack up too many points and you must take re-education classes… and you’re not allowed to ride high speed trains.

Wegman’s supermarkets are using artificial intelligence and facial recognition? Outrageous! Alert the authorities! Cancel dinner!
Never mind the fact that on your way to shop you passed by dozens of video cameras and license plate readers. Or the fact that your cellphone has been constantly pinging your location enroute. Attention shoppers: you have no privacy!



Supermarkets are not alone in their use of this tech.  CVS, Home Depot, Macy’s, Target and Walmart do, too.  They say it’s just for controlling theft (of which there is plenty), but I’m not buying it.  By knowing your face they know everything about you:  your online shopping history, social media posts and credit history.
With digital price shelf tags that update in seconds, the only real question is how long before the algorithm decides your face looks like it can afford to pay another 12 percent.
Even turning on your cellphone may involve recognizing your face. Calling Customer Service? They may use voice recognition or even measure your tone of voice for signs of stress and frustration.
Airlines can deduce the reason for that last-minute trip you’re booking.  If it’s for a funeral, critics wonder if they might charge you more because you absolutely need to travel ASAP.  Airlines insist they’d never raise fares because you’re flying to a funeral.  Of course not. They just happened to notice you booked one way, last minute, to Des Moines… right after your phone searched for “obituary.”
And when you do board your flight, it may be facial recognition scans that will get you on the plane, not just a boarding pass. Coming home from overseas your quick processing will depend on facial scanning by Customs and Border Patrol.
Did you buy anything overseas you didn’t declare? With a few (pesky but legal) steps, your credit card statement becomes a travel diary, complete with timestamps, locations, and a helpful list of things you “forgot” to declare.
Want to catch a Knicks or Rangers game at Madison Square Garden? Facial recognition may deny you access, even with a ticket, if you’re a lawyer who’s sued them in the past. Justice may be blind, but MSG security definitely isn’t.
In your car your face is less visible so companies like Flock depend on your license plates, color and model of your vehicle to ID you. That’s why cops are cracking down on obscured or “ghost” plates used to avoid tolls, the automotive equivalent of shoplifting. Here’s a site showing Flock cameras near you.
Flock also can also deploy drones to keep an eye on things… useful in law enforcement but a bit too scary for the Bridgeport City Council which, in a rare moment of restraint, overwhelmingly rejected a $500,000 contract covered by state funding.
Bridgeport joins a growing list of cities rejecting Flock out of privacy and data-sharing concerns. Those cities claim that Flock does more than scan license plates, but also the faces of protestors. And shares its data with the Feds.
Imagine the possibilities.
In China facial recognition identifies jay-walking pedestrians, shames them publicly and gives them demerits. Rack up too many points and you must take re-education classes… and you’re not allowed to ride high speed trains.

(Photo courtesy of ICE)The Louisiana Republican Party voted overwhelmingly Saturday to endorse President Donald Trump’s aggressive and controversial immigration enforcement efforts, even as Minnesota officials warn Minneapolis is descending into chaos as a result of a dramatic federal immigration crackdown. 
The Republican State Central Committee approved a resolution saying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are performing “vital work” that upholds “national sovereignty” and ensures public safety. The vote took place during the group’s quarterly meeting held this weekend in Baton Rouge. 
An initial draft of the resolution also rebuked Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, the second-highest ranking Republican in state government, for questioning Trump’s immigration strategy. Late last year, Nungesser told reporters he wondered whether the surge in federal border patrol agents who descended upon south Louisiana in December had hurt New Orleans’ tourism industry. 
But state Rep. Mike Bayham, R-Chalmette, convinced other members of the Republican committee to remove the comments about Nungesser from the resolution before the vote. Bayham said Nungesser is a popular elected official who regularly supports GOP causes by making donations to Republican women’s groups around the state. 

“This isn’t the time to pick a fight with the lieutenant governor,” Bayham said in an interview after the resolution passed. 

As lieutenant governor, Nungesser oversees the state’s tourism and marketing efforts. He said several business leaders in the hotel and restaurant industries had called him to say their employees had stopped showing up to their jobs during Louisiana’s immigration crackdown. Immigrants with legal work permits were scared they could get swept up in the federal raids if they went to work, he said.

Federal agents said they were targeting immigrants who weren’t in the country legally and who criminal backgrounds. But records show several people arrested during the Louisiana sweeps have no criminal history beyond traffic tickets, according to the Associated Press. 
Louisiana is also no longer a target from federal immigration enforcement. Border Patrol officers also abruptly pulled out of the state earlier this month so they could be redeployed to Minnesota, the Associated Press reported. 
For a few State Central Committee members Saturday, the frustration with Nungesser appeared to extend beyond his immigration comments. 

Charlie Buckels of Lafayette said he was upset with Nungesser because the lieutenant governor had “trashed” Gov. Jeff Landry and criticized the new closed party primary system Landry helped implement.

Nungesser has traveled the state campaigning against the new primary system, which he believes weakens moderate voters’ influence and empowers extremists in both political parties. 

Still, GOP activists at Saturday’s meeting said it would make the party leaders look foolish to criticize one of the state’s highest-profile Republicans. 

“What happens here is the media is going to talk about it, and that’s going to make us look like children,” committee member Heidi Parker Martin of New Iberia said, arguing against the formal criticism of Nungesser. “I would rather handle this in more of a private situation.” 

Reached by phone Saturday, Nungesser said state GOP leaders should have invited him to their meeting so he could defend himself against the criticism. Republicans should also be able to have a difference of opinion without facing a punishment for it, he added. 
“I speak out when something is wrong, and everybody should be able to do that,” Nungesser said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/250317neworleans1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-17 21:56:51.879213

TOPEKA — La actividad de agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de EE. UU. en Kansas City y en todos los Estados Unidos inspiró a una legisladora estatal demócrata a intentar apropiarse del proyecto de ley de un republicano que decía: “ICE no tendrá jurisdicción ni poder dentro del estado de Kansas ni de sus subdivisiones políticas.”
La representante Susan Ruiz, demócrata de Shawnee, propuso el miércoles en el pleno de la Cámara revisar el texto del proyecto de ley de la representante republicana Rebecca Schmoe, que establecía que organizaciones internacionales como las Naciones Unidas y la Organización Mundial de la Salud no tienen poder en Kansas.
En lugar de organizaciones internacionales, Ruiz insertó ICE.
“Tenemos que levantarnos”, dijo Ruiz. “Y al menos necesitamos decir — cada comunidad, cada ayuntamiento, cada comisionado de cada condado debe hacer una declaración para decir que ICE no es bienvenido en sus comunidades, y que, si están allí, deben ser sin máscara y bien identificados, y deberían llevar cámaras corporales.”
Ruiz basó la explicación de su enmienda en la reciente muerte de la exresidente de Kansas City Renee Good, a quien un agente de ICE disparó y mató a quemarropa a través del parabrisas de Good en Minneapolis.
“La tragedia siempre ocurre porque las personas que consiguen ese tipo de trabajos o se dedican a esos no tienen mucha formación. Y lo vimos”, dijo Ruiz. “Vimos todos los vídeos y puedes verlos tú mismo.”
Ruiz relacionó la actividad de ICE en todo el país con Kansas City, describiendo los efectos de una mayor presencia de agentes de inmigración. Menos gente va a trabajar, ir al supermercado y a las escuelas, dijo.
Mencionó informes de noticias sobre una redada de una horda de vehículos ICE en Kansas City, Missouri, dirigida por ICE en gasolineras y especulaciones sobre que ICE utilizara el área de Kansas City como base de concentración, lo cual no ha sido verificado.
Schmoe, un republicano de Ottawa, propuso el Proyecto de Ley 2204 de la Cámara en 2025. Fue la primera ley debatida en el pleno de la Cámara en la sesión legislativa de 2026, que comenzó el lunes.
Cuando los demócratas le presionaron para que explicara la motivación detrás del proyecto de ley, Schmoe dijo que su propósito era cerrar “una laguna que puede ser explotada”.
“Un grupo de mis electores acudió a mí y estaba muy preocupado porque entidades globales tomaran decisiones para Kansas, en lugar de para los habitantes de Kansas”, dijo.
Durante una audiencia en marzo de 2025 sobre el proyecto de ley, un alto miembro del personal legislativo lo calificó como “un proyecto de ley declarativo tal como es cualquier cosa” y puso en duda si las organizaciones internacionales objetivo tienen alguna autoridad existente en el estado.
Schmoe impugnó la enmienda de Ruiz, y un comité de normas decidió que no era pertinente, deteniendo el esfuerzo de Ruiz.
La Cámara votó el jueves para aprobar el proyecto de ley de Schmoe siguiendo las líneas partidistas, con 85 votos a favor y 35 en contra.

We must listen to people who are actually impacted.","Renee Good – shot three time and killed this month in Minneapolis by a masked Homeland Security agent, who then called her “a fucking bitch”.
George Retes, a US citizen and Army combat veteran, arrested by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in California and held for three days, allowed no communication with family or lawyers, and then released – without explanation, charges, or apology. 
Rümeysa Öztürk – a Tufts graduate student snatched off the street in Somerville by a team of government agents because she had the temerity to write an op-ed in the university newspaper criticizing the school’s response to the Israel-Hamas war. 
Incidents like these that are the result of the Trump administration’s efforts to rid the country of people it deems unworthy are profoundly alarming – but often distant – to many us who are comfortable in our status.  
But every citizen of the Commonwealth is indirectly supporting and benefitting from this effort. The 2026 Massachusetts budget anticipates collecting more than $25 million from the federal government for housing ICE prisoners at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility — the only facility in the state currently contracted with ICE to detain people.  
We need to own the consequences of this budgetary — and moral – decision. The intuitive reaction is that this is blood money. We must refuse to lease beds in our correctional facilities to ICE.  
Despite the visceral appeal of such a stance, we need to take a more nuanced view. Prohibiting ICE from holding prisoners in Plymouth County might actually harm the very people we are trying to protect. That said, if we are going to let ICE detain people here and take their money, at the least, we must not treat the funds like they are just another neutral source of revenue. 
There’s a compelling argument that no part of the state government should make ICE’s job easier: Collaborating with immoral action is never justified. We should, under this thinking, immediately cancel the contract with ICE.  
How the country addresses immigration is, admittedly, not an easy issue. We need immigrants – and have long been a place where those from other countries sought to a build a new, better life — and we also need secure borders. I know how hard striking this balance can be.  
When I served under Gov. Patrick as an undersecretary of public safety and security, I was tasked with defending why the Commonwealth was participating in the Obama administration’s Secure Communities program – an effort to identify when local and state police had arrested someone without immigration documentation.   
This is not an argument about the substance of who should be able to enter the country and under what circumstances. Whatever the validity of the underlying policy goals, ICE is engaged in activities that we cannot tolerate. As a prosecutor and public safety official, I have learned that process matters: How you go about enforcing the law is at least as important as the objective. Good policing is deeply mindful of that.   
It is not acceptable for government agents to act like the secret police in a totalitarian state, detaining people without identifying themselves by name or agency. It is neither necessary nor productive to go into the streets in full military kit carrying rifles designed for combat. These actions are designed to bully and intimidate, not preserve community safety. And – notwithstanding the recent opinion of the Supreme Court – it should be plainly unconstitutional for the government to stop and question people because of their race or ethnicity.   
Cancelling the Commonwealth’s contract with ICE would make every detention more costly and logistically complicated, as the federal government would have to spend more time and money on transportation. We should consider anything that throws sand in the gears of the deportation machine. There is even some evidence that jurisdictions with fewer detention beds see less ICE activity. 
I had concluded, therefore, with great rectitude, that there is no reason that we should allow ICE to hold people in Plymouth County – and that we should end our cooperation. Then I shared my opinion with a colleague who was personally affected. 
She is the close friend of someone who had just been arrested. She argued that banning ICE from holding people here would be a mistake. She couldn’t visit her friend if he was brought to a detention facility in Louisiana or Florida.  
As with all policies, it is important not to make decisions from afar. We must listen to people who are actually impacted. My friend prompted me to consider whether, as long as ICE is going to snatch people off our streets, we might decide that we want our immigrant neighbors held as close to home as possible, for as long as possible.  
Ending the ICE contract with the state might not mean fewer arrests in the Commonwealth. It might just mean ICE bundles even more detainees off to faraway for-profit prisons in jurisdictions with less sympathetic courts, further from counsel and family, and beyond the reach of inspection by state officials and state law. 
There is no easy answer. But this much, it seems to me, is clear: If we continue contracting with ICE, we must stop quietly collecting money from this arrangement and pretending that it does not facilitate ICE’s cruelty. Instead, the Commonwealth must match its rhetoric about supporting immigrants with its budget: Every dollar ICE pays us should be dedicated to programs that counter that agency’s inhumanity.  
The $25 million we expect from ICE this year could increase the state’s allocation to immigrant legal defense by 500 percent. Or it could more than double the Refugee Social Services Program. If we redirect ICE payments in this way, the Commonwealth would need to absorb the cost of housing the ICE detainees in Plymouth. But this is the only way we can allow ICE to use our facilities and still align our actions with our values.  
Gov. Healey and the Legislature must take this opportunity to be a national model for how to use ICE’s own resources to mitigate the horror of its policies.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Democrat Abigail Spanberger was sworn in Saturday as Virginia’s 75th governor, making history as the first woman to hold the commonwealth’s highest office and pledging to lead with unity, affordability and pragmatic action amid deep national divisions and growing uncertainty coming out of Washington.
Within hours of taking the oath, Spanberger, 46, moved swiftly to define the priorities of her administration, signing a package of executive orders aimed at lowering costs for families, strengthening public education, responding to federal disruptions and reshaping the internal operations of state government — an early signal that her tenure will be focused on affordability and what she described as “delivering results.
Standing on the steps of the Virginia state Capitol in Richmond, Spanberger framed the moment as both historic and forward-looking, calling the peaceful transfer of power “a cornerstone of our American democratic experiment” and a defining feature of American democracy.
“It is the honor of my life to stand before you and take the oath today,” Spanberger said, underscoring the gravity of the moment and her responsibility to all Virginians. 
She reflected on the generations who expanded democracy in Virginia — particularly women who fought for the right to vote and hold office — saying she stood before those “who could only dream of a day like today.”
Spanberger was sworn in alongside fellow Democrats Ghazala Hashmi, who took the oath as lieutenant governor, becoming the first Muslim to win statewide office anywhere in the United States, and Jay Jones, who was sworn in as Virginia’s attorney general, making history as the commonwealth’s first Black attorney general.
The ceremony drew a cross-section of Virginia’s political leadership, including all living former governors, from outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to L. Douglas Wilder, the nation’s first elected Black governor, who celebrated his 95th birthday Saturday and whom Spanberger recognized during the event.

Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland and U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-CA, were also in attendance. 
Spanberger thanked Youngkin and former first lady Suzanne Youngkin for their cooperation during the transition, as well as former Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, former Attorney General Jason Miyares and members of the outgoing administration for their service. The latter two did not attend the ceremony.
 A historic oath, a forward-looking message

Much of Spanberger’s inaugural address traced Virginia’s long democratic arc — from native sons George Washington and Patrick Henry to the suffrage movement and the Civil Rights era — but she repeatedly emphasized that the day was ultimately about the future Virginians will shape together.
Citing Patrick Henry’s warning that “United we stand, divided we fall,” Spanberger urged Virginians not to fracture into factions that threaten democratic institutions. 
She said the work of perfecting democracy has never been finished, but argued that Virginia’s history shows progress is possible when leaders and citizens confront challenges directly.
“This square has been the scene of remarkable dramas of equality and justice,” she said, referencing suffragists who pressed their cause at the Capitol, the delayed ratification of the 19th Amendment, and the 1957 Pilgrimage of Prayer led by the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
She also invoked moments when Virginia leaders confronted division head-on, quoting former Gov. Linwood Holton’s call to move beyond partisan camps and to “act together,” and highlighting Wilder’s 1990 inauguration as another milestone that reshaped expectations of who could lead.
Throughout the address, Spanberger emphasized the meaning of Virginia as a commonwealth — a government designed to serve the common good — and framed unity as both a moral obligation and a practical necessity.
 Executive actions underscore affordability focus

The urgency of that message was reflected in Spanberger’s first official acts as governor.
The series of executive orders she signed after the swearing in were designed to confront rising costs, reinforce public education and prepare the state for potential disruptions tied to federal policy changes.
“Today, we are responding to the moment,” Spanberger said. “We are setting the tone for what Virginians can expect over the next four years: pragmatic leadership focused on lowering costs and delivering results.”
The first three executive orders focus squarely on affordability — an issue that she declared a centerpiece of her 2026 agenda during a news conference in December.
One requires the governor’s secretaries and all executive branch agencies to submit reports within 90 days identifying immediate, actionable steps to reduce living expenses for Virginians, including housing, health care, energy, education, child care and grocery costs.
A second establishes an Interagency Health Financing Task Force within the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Resources, charged with developing a unified financing strategy to reduce duplicative spending, maximize federal funding and strengthen Virginia’s long-term health care infrastructure. 
The task force is directed to assess programs most vulnerable to federal policy changes, review oversight of managed care organizations and evaluate shared technology, licensing and procurement systems.
A third directive launches a comprehensive review of housing development regulations and permitting practices, with the goal of eliminating unnecessary requirements and reducing barriers to housing production. It also creates a Commission on Unlocking Housing Production to recommend legislative, regulatory and administrative changes to increase housing supply statewide.
Academic progress is the focus of a fourth executive order directing the Department of Education to strengthen literacy and math instruction, review accountability measures and expand access to advanced math coursework. 
The directive calls for implementing recommendations from a 2025 JLARC report, advancing a next-generation assessment system and launching a statewide listening tour of educators, parents and students.
Other executive actions respond to external pressures, including federal workforce reductions, funding cuts, tariff impacts and immigration-related effects. 
One order establishes an Economic Resiliency Task Force to coordinate the state’s response, including managing potential disruptions to Medicaid and SNAP, supporting displaced federal workers and expanding agricultural and forestry exports amid tariff uncertainty.
Additional orders initiate a review of the Board of Visitors appointment process for public colleges and universities; establish narrowly defined standby emergency authority for senior officials if the governor is unreachable; formally delegate operational authority to the governor’s chief of staff; and create a comprehensive equal opportunity and non-discrimination policy across state government.
A tenth executive order rescinds Youngkin’s Executive Order 47, which required and encouraged state and local law enforcement agencies to divert resources toward enforcing federal civil immigration laws. 
The directive redirects law enforcement to focus on core public safety responsibilities, including investigating crime, staffing local jails and engaging with communities.
The move aligns with a position Spanberger outlined during an interview with The Mercury in August, when she said she would move quickly as governor to end policies she argued pulled Virginia law enforcement away from their primary mission and strained already limited resources.
 A personal case for pragmatic governance

In her inaugural address, Spanberger did not name President Donald Trump, but repeatedly referenced federal actions and rhetoric she said were unsettling Virginians.
“I know many of you are worried about the recklessness coming out of Washington,” she said, citing concerns over health care access, rising costs, attacks on public servants and policies she said betray American values.
She rooted her priorities in personal experience, describing her middle-class upbringing, her work as a federal law enforcement officer and her service as a CIA case officer focused on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation.
Those roles, she said, reinforced the importance of accountability and service — lessons she now brings to the governor’s office. She also spoke as a mother of three daughters, emphasizing the strain rising costs place on families and the difficulty of planning for the future amid uncertainty.
Her policy agenda centers on affordability, education, economic growth and public safety. She pledged to tackle housing costs by cutting red tape and increasing supply, lower energy costs by ensuring high-volume users pay their fair share, and protect health care access while addressing prescription drug pricing practices.
As she closed her address, Spanberger urged Virginians to consider how future generations will judge this moment.
“Choose to stand united. Choose to serve one another. Choose to act together,” she said. “As we continue forward, let us be united for Virginia’s future.”

From Wichita’s world-class aviation industry to Olathe-based Garmin, Kansas knows how to build, create, and lead. However, one of the biggest threats to our state’s innovation is the challenge  imposed by a federal agency that was never meant to serve against the interests of American businesses: the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC.
Patent trolls, which are shell companies that buy up old patents solely to sue productive businesses, use the ITC as leverage to force costly settlements. The agency’s Section 337 statute, meant to protect U.S. industries from unfair foreign trade, has been twisted by patent trolls into a tool for private profit. Patent trolls file cases with the ITC because the agency has an extraordinary power called an exclusion order to ban certain products from entering the United States. Given the devastating consequences an exclusion order can have for a business, the possibility of losing a case and receiving one is enough to lead patent trolls’ targets to settle.
It’s complete extortion, and it drains time, money and resources that could otherwise go toward research, hiring, and growth.
Garmin, a proud Kansas company employing thousands across the state and one of America’s top technology and navigation companies, has spent years fending off patent troll infringement cases before the ITC. The problem isn’t that Garmin has done anything wrong, as courts have repeatedly ruled in its favor, tossing out weak and baseless patent claims. The problem is that the ITC’s process itself gives patent trolls an opening to exploit.
Garmin is often forced to defend itself from patent trolls at the ITC. Despite multiple victories in court, the company has still had to use up resources and valuable time. Instead of shielding American innovation, the ITC is giving foreign patent trolls a platform to drain American companies like Garmin.
Kansas isn’t alone. Across the country, the ITC’s outdated process has allowed patent trolls to file cases that threaten the supply chain and increase costs for businesses and consumers alike. Legal experts have long warned that the ITC’s broad interpretation of “domestic industry” invites abuse. A Hastings Science & Technology Law Journal study found that patent trolls routinely exploit this loophole to extract settlements rather than protect real innovation. In an economy where every dollar counts, these unnecessary battles hurt competitiveness and jeopardize American jobs.
In Kansas, the effect is especially clear. Garmin employs nearly 5,000 Kansans at its U.S. operational headquarters in Olathe and ranks among America’s best large employers. Its success supports families, local suppliers, and the broader regional economy. Every dollar spent fighting useless patent claims is a dollar not spent on innovation, hiring or investment in Kansas communities.
That’s why members of Congress have introduced the Advancing America’s Interests Act. This bipartisan legislation would reform the ITC to ensure it only intervenes when those who make claims have a legitimate U.S. industry at stake. In other words, if you don’t make anything or employ anyone in the United States, you can’t weaponize the process.
The AAIA restores the ITC’s original intent, protecting genuine American innovation, not rewarding litigation abuse. For Kansas, that means companies like Garmin can focus on doing what they do best: designing cutting-edge products, supporting local jobs, and fueling our state’s economic growth.
Leaders like Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kansas, understand what’s at stake. He’s been a strong voice for protecting Kansas workers, innovators, and manufacturers. He understands that standing up to patent abuse isn’t just about fixing a federal agency, it’s about defending the jobs, technologies and communities that make Kansas – and the United States – strong.
While patent trolls may game the system, Kansas thrives on hard work and innovation. It’s time for real accountability to the ITC.

In a letter rejecting the complaint, Gallus said the mailing could be viewed as partisan but that doesn’t mean it creates a violation under his jurisdiction.
Last week, a Harlowton voter filed a complaint alleging the Secretary of State’s Office should not have used taxpayer dollars to pay for the postcard, which said “only citizens should be allowed to vote.”
The Secretary of State’s Office has not responded to a question about the cost of the postcard or how many Montanans received it. Montana has nearly 785,000 registered voters.
The postcard announced a partnership with the federal government to “strengthen election security” and featured a picture of Secretary Christi Jacobsen and President Donald Trump.
The complaint said the postcard pushed a false narrative that “elections are rigged” and “someone other than citizens” are voting.
However, Gallus said the complaint does not clearly allege any violation of statute over which he has jurisdiction. He also said elected officials have a responsibility to communicate with citizens, and voters elected the Secretary of State based in part on her political leanings.
“Expecting that all communication following an election would be devoid of a political bent so as to avoid any criticism or open debate is unreasonable and impracticable,” Gallus wrote in the letter.
Gallus said he wanted to address the complaint in detail because his office has received numerous inquiries about the postcard in relation to “the use of government funds or resources.”
“Montana’s elected officials routinely provide communications to Montana citizens which under a certain lens may appear to be political,” Gallus wrote. “Montana laws do prohibit the use of public resources for political purposes.”
But he said he and staff in his office reviewed the mailer, and it does not appear to violate any provision of the Montana Code of Ethics or any campaign regulation because it “does not have a political purpose” as defined by law.
In making that determination, he said, he looks for words that solicit support or opposition to any political committee; nomination or election of a person to public office; or passage of a ballot issue. That means language such as “vote,” “oppose,” “support,” “elect,” “defeat,” or “reject.”
Gallus said his office also looks at whether material depicts a clearly identified candidate, party or ballot issue “in a manner that is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as a call for the nomination, election or defeat” of the candidate or issue.
Gallus said it is a high bar, and the postcard doesn’t meet the threshold. He said neither Jacobsen or Trump are currently running for office, and the mailing doesn’t include any express words of support.
“Public officials have associated duties, which include communicating with constituents,” Gallus wrote. “For Montana’s Secretary of State, this means communicating with all voters regarding elections, voting and the SOS positions on citizen only voting, which she appears to be doing here.”
In a subsequent news release, the Secretary of State’s Office said it had identified 23 potential non-citizens who had voted. A spokesperson did not answer questions about when they most recently voted, what counties they had voted in, or what the next steps would be.
Missoula County Elections Administrator Bradley Seaman said earlier the 23 potential non-citizens indicated the current system is working well; it represented 29-one-thousandths of 1 percent of voters.
Seaman also said it is important to address those findings as soon as possible. He pointed to a recent tied vote in Missoula County where one vote would have made a difference. (In that case, a council race, the Missoula City Council made the appointment.)
To vote in Montana, people need to be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years old before the election, and a Montana resident for at least 30 days before the next election.

Haley Stevens said Friday that a key portion of her time in the U.S. Senate, if she becomes the Democratic nominee in August and is elected in November, would focus on helping Black, brown and other minority communities thrive across Michigan.
Stevens visited Detroit this week to roll out what those plans might look like, calling it her “Michigan Hope Agenda.” The congresswoman unveiled the policy proposals during a “fireside chat” Friday moderated by state Rep. Joe Tate (D-Detroit) at the Durfee Innovation Society.
Stevens said she would focus on equitable federal investments back into communities, economic empowerment and access to capital, safer communities so families and businesses can flourish, and health and stability for those same families. The congresswoman further extolled the need for education innovation and workforce assurances, well-managed water and infrastructure, and lowering the overall costs of housing.
Stevens said that for her to succeed in the U.S. Senate, she needs to make sure that residents back home can connect the dots to quality economic development that doesn’t leave minority communities behind.

“We know that there, for too long, have been communities that get overlooked. We know that there has been a lack of investment in communities of Black and brown communities,” Stevens said. “That hope for equal really deeply matters.”
That’s why things like housing and investments and public health will take center stage in a would-be Senate tenure for Stevens.
“It’s a path for all of us to succeed,” she said. “And to do this in the Motor City, the heart of Detroit, we’re going to put our stake into what Michigan needs at the lawmaking table, in that chief lawmaking role for our state, in the U.S. Senate.”
Stevens previously worked as an organizer and later in the administration of former President Barack Obama as the chief of staff to his auto rescue efforts. The congresswoman said that people had written Detroit off the map, but now, the lights continue to be on in the city and it has become a beacon of urban renewal since those Obama years and onward.
She hopes to continue that work serving in the Senate as she ramps up her bid to win the Democratic nomination in the August primary. She would have big shoes to fill after U.S. Sen. Gary Peters announced that he would not seek reelection this year, although both he and Stevens have been routinely hailed as two of Michigan’s most effective federal lawmakers.
Stevens, Peters rated most effective Democrats in technology, other key policy areas

Making a policy pronouncement on how she would assist minority communities, at the top of the year, follows Stevens’ aim to make a splash as primary season gets into full swing — she currently faces a three-way race with state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and former Detroit health official Abdul El-Sayed.
On federal investments, Stevens said she would work to ensure federal resources and infrastructure dollars are delivered equitably to underserved Michigan communities to strengthen public services, transit, and economic opportunity where it is needed most.
Stevens would expand access to capital and training for underserved communities and advance an industrial policy that creates jobs, lowers costs, and strengthens Michigan’s economic future.
Safer communities would take precedence in her policy agenda, and Stevens said she would advance fair and accountable policing, invest in community-based violence prevention, and strengthen common sense gun safety laws to protect families and rebuild trust.
A common theme for the Democrats in the race, Stevens said her tenure would also focus on health care issues, particularly lowering the costs of care, advancing health equity, protecting science-based care, and defending Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid so Michigan families can live with dignity, health, and security.
A 21st Century manufacturing model would guide her policy focus with an emphasis on investments in STEM and job-training pipelines, and other policies that strengthen the supply chain and prepare workers for the industries of the future.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Clean and safe drinking water is also top of mind for Stevens. She said she would champion funding for lead pipe replacement and ending PFAS contamination, all with a focus on environmental justice.
Housing is also a big component of the plan. Following the chat with Tate, Stevens told reporters that her plan would also focus on Generation Z homebuyers who may feel like they are left out of attaining home ownership due to financial strains and lack of access to the very capital she wants to make available.
She said that was something that she and Tate, the former Michigan House Speaker, often talk about at the local level in Detroit.
“Under his leadership, there were some remarkable improvements to our housing development here in the state. There is a lot more to do, though,” Stevens said. “It’s not just about starting the conversation and recognizing that home ownership now begins at a much later age. For this next generation, we need to put more money in people’s pocketbooks.”
Stevens said one of the federal solutions she’s working on legislatively is for a pre-tax savings program so people can buy homes earlier.
“That way, we can increase the affordable home stock here in Michigan and support our building trades as we move forward,” Stevens said. “But this has to do with an economic agenda that is clearly not serving us well under this current administration. Erratic tariffs have been a tax on people. Their pocketbooks are being stretched, and that’s taking away from the investments that people could be making in that first home.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1166504-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-17 10:57:47.009294

For Detroit homeowners over 65 who overwhelmingly live on fixed incomes, unexpected costs – increases in grocery prices, rising health care premiums or an emergency repair – heighten their risk of financial instability and can even lead to them falling into poverty.
I am a policy researcher at Poverty Solutions at the University of Michigan. Our initiative uses action-based research, an approach that seeks to understand real-world problems and inform policy changes that could make life work better for people with low incomes. The center recently examined data from the 2023 American Community Survey to explore how low-income seniors in Detroit are affected by declining housing values and high housing costs compared to seniors across Michigan.
Federal, state and local programs to help seniors with these costs are already strained. As the population of older adults in metro Detroit continues to grow, demand for support services, such as caregiving and healthy meal programs, will likely increase.
 Housing cost burdens are more acute for Detroit seniors

The poverty rate of senior-headed households in Detroit is nearly twice as high as the rate statewide.
Detroit seniors, both owners and renters, are more likely to be housing cost-burdened than Michigan seniors overall, with 45% paying more than 30% of their income on housing costs compared to 31% of seniors statewide. This is partially driven by lower median incomes in the city compared to the state.
Even when we focus on the seniors who would be considered the most financially stable, those who own their homes free and clear, the proportion burdened by housing costs is twice as high as the state: 32% versus 16%.

 Detroit seniors pay more for property taxes and utilities

Lower incomes aren’t the only thing driving the higher housing cost burden. Detroit seniors pay more for all homeownership costs, including utilities – not only as a proportion of home values and income, but also in terms of real costs.
Detroiters face higher rates for auto insurance, and they pay more for utilities, compared to others in the state, adding to a situation where many residents, especially seniors on fixed incomes, struggle to make ends meet.
While the cost of living in urban areas is often higher compared to suburban and rural places, my analysis found that comparative costs for insurance, water, electricity and gas are lower in cities such as Milwaukee and Pittsburgh, which points to systemic issues that might be unique to Detroit.

Insurance and property taxes are also higher for seniors in Detroit compared to seniors across the state, especially relative to median home values. Detroit seniors pay the same or slightly more for these essentials despite living in homes that are worth less, based on the analysis.
The median house value for senior property owners in Detroit is $65,000, compared to $170,000 for seniors in Michigan.
 High property taxes and insurance rates drive costs

Detroit lost over half a million residents between 1980 and 2020, causing an oversupply of single-family housing stock and a steady drop in home prices.
As residents left and businesses followed, the property tax base eroded. To generate the same revenue as cities with a richer tax base, Detroit levies property taxes at relatively high rates. Detroiters face a property tax rate close to 3%, significantly higher than the national average of 1.38%.
The housing market in Detroit has seen such large declines in property values that a disconnect has emerged. The replacement cost of a home, which is the actual expense required to reconstruct the dwelling, is often substantially higher than its current market value. This makes the cost of homeowner’s insurance disproportionately expensive relative to the market value of a home in Detroit.
A property’s condition and the condition of neighboring properties also raises the cost of homeowner’s insurance because insurance premiums are primarily influenced by the risk associated with insuring a property. Poor property and neighborhood conditions limit the availability of homeowner’s insurance, driving those who want homeowner’s insurance to purchase costly policies from insurers of last resort, or companies that provide coverage to people who cannot obtain it through other means due to high insurance risks.
The high cost drives many Detroit residents to forgo homeowner’s insurance. According to my analysis, almost 35% of Detroit seniors do not insure their homes, putting their main financial asset at risk.
 Big utility bills

Utility bills in Detroit are higher compared to those statewide for two reasons: higher use and higher rates. The housing stock in Detroit is significantly older, with 88% of Detroit seniors living in houses built before 1960, compared to 34% of seniors in the rest of the state. These older homes use more energy because they often lack modern insulation and have single-paned windows, outdated appliances, older plumbing fixtures and poor seals around windows and doors.
Detroiters and others in Michigan served by DTE Energy, a utility provider, pay gas and electricity rates that are higher than others in the state. Detroiters also pay more for utilities due to a 5% “utility users tax” added to their gas and electricity bills. This surcharge isn’t new. It stems from legislation originally passed in the 1970s, and the funds collected flow to the Public Lighting Authority, which is responsible for improving and maintaining street lights in the city, and to the Detroit Police Department.
In the wake of Detroit’s bankruptcy filing in 2013, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department carried out widespread shut-offs. From 2014 to 2020, the shut-offs affected as many as 141,000 Detroit residents, mostly those with low incomes. The crisis garnered national and international attention.
The initial crisis has passed, yet the cost of water continues to increase across the entire state, with those in the metro Detroit area served by the Great Lakes Water Authority seeing substantially higher rate increases than the state overall to cover deferred maintenance and infrastructure costs.
 Costs are compounded by social isolation

Costs stemming from isolation and disability exacerbate the financial strain Detroit seniors already face.
Several factors contribute to older adults living alone, including increased life expectancy for women as well as children and family members moving farther away from each other. Older adults living alone are also more likely to be poorer than older adults who are a part of a larger household.
This issue is more pronounced in Detroit, where 54.7% of seniors live alone compared to the 43.2% statewide average. Living alone increases the risk of social isolation, which is linked to poorer health outcomes. Detroit seniors also have higher rates of disability than other seniors in the state of Michigan, which can lead to higher health care costs, decreased mobility and increased social isolation.
 Less funding could create more hardship

Historically the demand for support outstrips the available resources, with only a small proportion of eligible households receiving energy assistance. And now, programs that help vulnerable seniors with the costs of utilities are at risk of funding cuts.
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department’s Lifeline Plan, launched in 2022, ran out of state and federal money in October 2025.
Meanwhile, the entire staff that administers the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, was cut in April 2025. While the program is funded in the continuing resolution passed on Nov. 12, 2025, it is zeroed out in the president’s fiscal year 2026 proposed budget.
Even before funding uncertainties emerged, Detroit seniors who own their homes faced institutional barriers accessing property tax relief, putting many at risk of tax foreclosure. Additionally, Detroiters struggle to keep up with home repair costs, heightened by the needs of older homes and because the home repair assistance system is fragmented and difficult to access.
Without these programs, Detroit seniors will be left without an essential lifeline.

Unions and advocates want a wealth tax targeting billionaires to make up the loss.,"Guest Commentary written by

Josephine Rios
Josephine Rios is a nursing assistant at Kaiser Permanente.


Doctors told us my grandson wouldn’t live past three months, but they didn’t know Elijah was capable of. Today he’s 7 years old, stubborn as ever and fighting every day to prove them wrong.
Elijah was born with cerebral palsy. Caring for him is a full-time, all-hands-on-deck operation that includes in-home nurses, physical and occupational therapy, school support and a small pharmacy’s worth of medications. 
None of that care is optional. It’s what keeps him alive, learning, laughing and giving me attitude. 
It’s only possible because of Medi-Cal. Now California’s health care system — the system that keeps Elijah alive — is being pushed to the brink. With $100 billion a year in federal health care cuts barreling toward Americans, California is expected to lose about $30 billion a year in Medi-Cal funding. 
Families like mine are living in a state of panic. Elijah’s medications alone would run over $5,000 a month. That’s not a “tough choice” for a working family — that’s impossible. 
And the emergency rooms we rely on when his seizures hit? They may not even be open.
This isn’t a hypothetical threat. This is my reality. It’s the reality of millions of Californians who depend on the care we’ve been promised.
This disaster is preventable. There’s a simple, fair, no-nonsense solution on the table, the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act. I’m one of thousands of Californians fighting for it, as the campaign collects signatures to place the proposal on the ballot this year.

As a nursing assistant, union member and grandmother battling to keep a special needs child healthy, I don’t have time for political games. I’m interested in what works, and this would work.
The measure would create a one-time, 5% emergency tax on Californians worth more than $1 billion. That’s roughly 200 people, who together hold more than $2 trillion in wealth. The tax would be spread out over a five-year span.
And because of loopholes in tax law, most of that money may never be taxed at all.
This proposal would raise $100 billion for California. It would keep hospitals open, protect Medi-Cal, prevent layoffs of health care workers and keep 3.4 million Californians who are at risk insured. 
In other words, it would keep my grandson and many others alive.
As for the billionaires, they honestly wouldn’t even feel it.
I’ve heard some people say this tax is “punishing success.” Give me a break. Working families already pay our share. We pay it every time we choose which bills to pay. Every time we work a double shift. Every time we sit in an ER praying that the lights stay on long enough to keep our kids breathing.
All we’re asking is for the tiny group who benefit the most from California’s economy, to pitch in one time to prevent a total health care collapse. That’s not punishment. That’s responsibility.
Voters from across the political spectrum support this. When your child or parent is sick, politics matter a whole lot less than their survival.
The ultra-wealthy and their lobbyists are already gearing up to fight this effort. They always do. They’re loud, they’re powerful and they’re used to getting their way.
But I’ve got news for them: so am I. I’ve had to fight for Elijah since the day he was born. I’ve fought for my patients, my coworkers and my community for decades. I know how to stand my ground, and I know I’m not standing alone.
California is at the cliff’s edge. We can either let the healthcare system fall, or we can pull together and pull it back.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/031125-Medicaid-Bakersfield-LV_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-17 08:57:26.587593

First State Ballet Comes to The Baby Grand
Presented by Delaware’s only professional ballet company, “Dreams In Motion” features two works by choreographer Viktor Plotnikov that highlight both technical precision and expressive storytelling. The program includes Fantasy to Dvořák and Nonsense (In the Sense of Innocence), offering contrasting yet complementary interpretations of the dream world.
Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 7:00 p.m. and Sunday, February 22, 2026 at 2:00 p.m. at the Baby Grand Theater inside The Grand Opera House, First State Ballet Theatre invites audiences to experience “Dreams In Motion”, a contemporary ballet program that explores imagination, emotion, and the fluid nature of dreams through movement.
In Fantasy to Dvořák, dancers respond to the rich musical compositions of Antonín Dvořák with lyrical movement that emphasizes musicality and emotional depth. The choreography allows the dancers to move seamlessly between strength and softness, creating a visually compelling piece that feels both grounded and ethereal. The ballet showcases the company’s classical foundation while embracing contemporary phrasing and flow.
Nonsense (In the Sense of Innocence) shifts the tone to something more playful and whimsical. This work leans into the unpredictable nature of dreams, using inventive movement and lighthearted interactions to spark curiosity and delight. The choreography invites audiences to interpret the performance through their own lens, reflecting how dreams often feel familiar yet open to endless meaning.
The Baby Grand Theater provides an intimate setting for this program, allowing audiences to experience the nuances of the choreography up close. Located within The Grand Opera House in downtown Wilmington, the venue enhances the connection between dancers and viewers, making each performance feel personal and immersive.
Tickets for “Dreams In Motion” range from $42 to $62, offering an accessible opportunity to experience professional ballet in a contemporary format. Whether you are a longtime dance enthusiast or attending ballet for the first time, this program offers a fresh perspective on movement, music, and storytelling.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)There are a few different tactics for passing legislation. One is to pick a change in the law that’s not likely to draw too many detractors. Another is to take a big swing at a change in the law that’s certain to be opposed and will likely need to be offered to legislators during a few sessions so they can learn more about the issue.
With open meetings laws, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley has chosen the first course of action. He has offered three bills that will make slight, but needed, changes.
Those bills include a clarification that an agenda must include items to be considered during an official meeting; a revision for the requirements for executive session; and a requirement that a state open meeting agenda must be posted on the state website 72 hours before the meeting is scheduled to start.

Those bills aren’t likely to elicit too much of a howl from lawmakers. No one can blame Jackley for reaching for some low-hanging fruit. However, while the attorney general is noted for being tough on crime, he has yet to try to put any teeth in the laws governing the punishment of open meetings violators. The problem is that as well-intentioned as Jackley’s bills are, they don’t approach what South Dakota really needs to fix its open meetings problems.
On one end, there will be an effort this year to bring light to the public, letting them know when meetings will be held and what will be on the agenda. Still dwelling in the dark is the fact that there is a lack of accountability whenever the boards of local governments — city council, school board, county commission — go into a closed or executive session. By law they are allowed to meet behind closed doors to discuss personnel matters or student expulsion, consult with an attorney or negotiate contracts.
The problem is that once the public has been sent away, there’s no way to know if the local board is following the rules. There have been cases of elected officials using that time away from the public to discuss locally controversial issues that don’t fit within the limits allowed by law. Some boards use the fact that their lawyer is in the room to claim that they are “consulting” on legal matters while they discuss how to handle volatile issues.
Other states have recognized this loophole and adopted specific rules for when the local commission can shut the door and consult with its attorney. The law in Arizona says such a consultation in a closed meeting is allowed for the “discussion or consultation with the attorneys of the public body in order to consider its position and instruct its attorneys regarding the public body’s position regarding contracts that are the subject of negotiations, in pending or contemplated litigation or in settlement discussions conducted in order to avoid or resolve litigation.”
Unless an elected official comes forward to say that she believes the executive session she just sat through broke the law, there’s no way of knowing what goes on behind closed doors. One idea that’s been floating around South Dakota open government circles is having each executive session recorded. When a question arises about whether or not the board followed the law, the recording would be reviewed privately by a judge to determine if there were any violations.










The problem is that once the public has been sent away, there’s no way to know if the local board is following the rules.


So far, no one in the Legislature or state government wants to take on those fights. Many see the Legislature, top-heavy with Republicans, as a roadblock to significant change. That’s odd, because Republicans should be the first ones calling for greater transparency in government.
These are the same lawmakers clamoring for more transparency in state credit card use after discovering the spendthrift ways of former Gov. Kristi Noem. It stands to reason that greater transparency in the workings of local governments would also be good for taxpayers.
Some lawmakers have said that cutting the budgets of counties and school districts would ease some of the complaints they’re hearing about high property taxes. They should welcome a means for keeping an eye on those tax dollars by ensuring that there’s a way to figure out what local officials are up to in executive session.
The state’s open meetings law has its share of violations. To his credit, Jackley resurrected the Open Meetings Commission that had gone dormant for four years. Last November, that commission found local boards had violated the open meetings law in 10 of 12 cases.
Some violations are just a misinterpretation of the law. Others are blatant attempts to keep public business out of public view. To strengthen that law, the state needs leaders who aren’t content to just reach for low-hanging fruit.

I’m sure Cosell would have some strong words about the financial factors and threats that have left Missouri without an NFL football team for the first time since 1960 despite the significant taxpayer funds spent to develop both Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium and the domed stadium once used by St. Louis Rams.
Cosell regularly attacked the NFL franchises and local governments for using threats to depart a city without higher local tax funds to improve their stadiums.
News stories about Cosell’s 1970s testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, quoted him saying those efforts were “blackmail” and “extortion.”
“Let them run their business like any other without protection granted by Congress. Lord knows they’re big business” Cosell was quoted by UPI as testifying before the committee.
There is a direct Missouri connection to Cosell’s comments.
In 1995 when the Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis various news reports cited the reason as financial frustrations about Los Angeles.
Twenty years later, the Rams abandoned Missouri citing inadequate fan support and because city funding for the St. Louis Stadium was not good enough. The team moved back to Califonia.
Ultimately, St. Louis won a $790 million lawsuit award from the Rams to cover the costs for the Rams failing to meet financial requirements for stadium improvements.
The latest team to depart Missouri is the Kansas City Chiefs. They abandoned Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium after voters defeated a sales tax proposal for stadium improvements.
The Chiefs will move to a new stadium in Kansas.
The Kansas City Star reports the move could cost Kansas more than $6 billion to build the new stadium.
Beyond that, the Star reports that the Kansas financial incentive for the Chief’s to move could end a restriction on state tax incentives to stop “boarder war” raids that entice a business in one state to move.
It makes me wonder about the potential costs and legal fights if the Kansas Kansas City Chiefs seek to move from Kansas back to Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri.
And of course, an abandoned football stadium in St. Louis and at Kansas City’s Arrowhead might intice teams from across the country to jump at the opportunity if, of course, there are sufficient financial incentives.
If you read various stories about tax funding for NFL teams, you’ll read a reference to STARBonds to entice relocation to Kansas.
They are bonds issued to finance a private project, like a football stadium, that are funded by additional sales taxes collected within the district.
I write this column from the perspective listening to legislative debates about the advantages to provide tax breaks for various private financial interests.
From my hours reading Cosell’s arguments and listening to him on Monday Night Football, I gained a far better understanding about the danger of committing government funds to private sports operations that are free to leave for other locations.
As a footnote, the move from Missouri for more financial benefits has lost the state two Super Bowl champions.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020925Arrowhead4-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-17 07:56:12.935161

We started this feature last year and heard from readers all over the state that they found it helpful, so we’re back at it for the 2026 session. 
Full disclosure: The legislative notebook won’t be the be-all, end-all of legislative coverage with deep context and analysis. We hope you’re signed up for our free emailed newsletter, The Sunrise, which includes all of our in-depth content and reporting from Idaho Capital Sun reporters, as well as reporting from our sister publications through our parent nonprofit States Newsroom and our D.C. bureau that brings you news from Capitol Hill each day.
What the legislative notebook will be is a quick and dirty run-down of which bills were introduced, considered in committee, debated on the Idaho House and Senate floors, and updates on whether Idaho Gov. Brad Little has signed (or vetoed) major pieces of legislation into law. 
It will also include any information we have on what Idahoans can expect in the following week of legislative action. Things can move very quickly during the session, especially toward the end of our legislators’ time in Boise (usually around the end of March or early April), and often agendas for committees are not posted until the evening before a committee meets. We’ll do the best we can to prepare you for the following week with that in mind.
We’ll also include a few fun observations that we have as we make our way through the session, including quotes and social media posts of the week, photos that may not make it into our usual coverage, and any other odds and ends that we find interesting or helpful to you as you track how legislators are spending their time.
And with that, let’s get started.
 Idaho Gov. Little delivers State of the State, and the budget dominates legislative conversations in week one

The state budget – and projected multi-million dollar budget deficits for the current 2026 fiscal year and the upcoming 2027 fiscal year – have taken center stage in the Statehouse as the legislative session gets underway.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little submits plan to balance state budget without repealing Medicaid expansion

Very few bills were introduced or acted on this first week, but there was plenty of discussion about how the state is situated financially.
Is it a big deal that the state is facing a projected $40.3 million budget deficit for 2026 and a $555.2 million deficit for 2027? That depends on whom you ask.
Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said Monday that he’s tired of the negative talk surrounding the state budget deficit. So are other Republicans in legislative leadership.
“This isn’t a big deal,” Moyle said at a GOP press conference. “It’s going to be easy to get through.” 
 
But Democrats and some advocacy groups, especially groups that focus on Idahoans’ access to health care, paint a different picture entirely.
They say the budget crunch is self-inflicted due to the $450 million in tax cuts and tax credits approved by the Legislature and Idaho Gov. Brad Little in 2025, as well as $4 billion in income tax cuts that have been approved by lawmakers over the past five years.
They say the plans to close the gap, including the governor’s proposal to cut about $45 million from the state’s Medicaid program’s budget, harm everyday Idahoans who rely on those essential services. Some of those proposals include cuts to Medicaid’s dentistry services and cuts to programs that support people with disabilities.
Some Republicans, including Moyle, have said they would consider a full repeal of Medicaid expansion, which is how approximately 90,000 Idahoans access health insurance across the state.
While Little said he was not looking to repeal Medicaid expansion, and did not include full repeal in his budget proposal, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said she is still deeply concerned about the impact of the budget cuts Idaho legislators will make to balance the budget. 
“We are in a hole,” Rubel said at a Jan. 8 press conference. “There’s no question about it. We are $555 million below what we need to cover the most basic maintenance budgets to keep the lights on in our agencies.”
 When should Idaho legislators set a state revenue projection?

The Legislature’s powerful budget committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, has fielded recent criticism from legislators of both parties and from stakeholders around Idaho because it set the state’s revenue projection late in the session last year. Essentially, critics say, the budget committee and Legislature passed tax cuts before having a clear picture of how much revenue the state had coming into its coffers and therefore didn’t know if the state could truly afford those cuts.
And after the budget committee met on Friday, some legislators are worried that a similar situation is playing out again in 2026.
On Thursday, the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee voted to recommend a revenue projection of $5.8 billion for next year. Notably, that revenue target is about $137 million more than the revenue projection Gov. Little issued Monday in conjunction with his State of the State address.
The budget committee was scheduled to consider the revenue projection on Friday morning. However, without any public explanation, JFAC leaders started Friday’s meeting about 20 minutes late, pulled back their agenda for the day and removed the agenda item for the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee’s report.
After Friday’s meeting adjourned, JFAC co-chairmen Sen. Scott Grow and Rep. Josh Tanner, both R-Eagle, said they wanted to give JFAC members more time to study the revenue recommendation, and it’s back on the agenda for JFAC on Monday.

Senate Pro Tem Kelly Anthon, R-Burley, at a Jan. 8 press conference, said setting the revenue projection early in the session is top of mind for legislative leaders.
“We’ve decided, as majority leadership, to try to do a better job this session (by) really hitting the revenue projection early and to work better with the governor’s office to try to get to that revenue number quickly,” Anthon said. “We’ll see how that goes, but that is the goal.”

In the State of the State Address, the governor said while this may be a tighter budget year than lawmakers have experienced in the recent past, he stressed the state is fiscally sound.
“The proof is clear – Idaho’s fundamentals remain among the strongest in the nation,” Little said. “Your dollar stretches farther here than anywhere else. Our unemployment rate is among the lowest in the nation. We lead in personal income growth, and our economic activity continues to outpace most states, reflecting a diverse and resilient economy. Jobs are growing, and Idaho’s healthy business climate remains a magnet for employers, talent, and investment.”
 What to expect next week at the Idaho Legislature

Quick note: Many committees, especially at the beginning of the session, have agenda items known as an RS (which stands for routing slip). That’s legislative talk for “draft legislation.” An RS is not a public record until a committee votes to introduce the bill. Many of those agenda items are only listed by subject matter, so it’s impossible to ascertain what the RS is specifically about, other than the few words used to describe the RS until the introductory hearing takes place.

 Quote of the week

“Our plan uses a responsible mix of one-time and ongoing spending reductions to keep the budget structurally sound. Across state government, executive agencies will tighten their belts. We’re renegotiating contracts to save money. We’re reprioritizing initiatives. We’re finding operational efficiencies, and we will make disciplined use of cash balances and interest earnings. All of this serves to limit the impact on Idahoans as we right-size government.” – Idaho Gov. Brad Little in his 2026 State of the State address

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)While Maine began bracing this week for a suspected increase in immigration operations, local organizers have been preparing for this for months, or years if factoring in the longstanding immigrant rights organizations propping the work up.
Since the launch of an ICE watch hotline in October, more than 300 Mainers have now been trained by community groups to help verify reports of enforcement activity across the state and de-escalate tense situations. Their work has already begun and the number of people signing up to get involved continues to grow, said Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine. 
The hotline, organized by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice of which Presente! is a part, is also often used by the loved ones of people who have been detained to help connect them with financial, legal and other resources. 
“In times like these, when people are afraid and there’s a lot of reactivity,” Cron said, what’s essential is “staying rooted in the systems that we’ve created.” 
The hotline is one aspect of a multi-organization, grassroots effort to document federal activities and support immigrants in Maine against unlawful action. 
There is a solidarity fund to cover legal representation for people who are detained, volunteers who watch over students and their families during school drop off and pick up, networks to bring food and other necessities to people afraid to leave their homes, and protests.
All of this work is being done with little information about the scope of the suspected immigration operations coming to Maine. 
The mayors of Maine’s two largest cities announced Wednesday that they’re expecting increased federal immigration presence in their communities soon. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has neither confirmed nor denied plans. Gov. Janet Mills and members of Maine’s congressional delegation have also been unable to get confirmation. 
This comes after a particular ramp up of operations in Minnesota, after a federal agent shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good. The Trump administration has sent as many as 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota, nearly five times the total sworn officers in the city’s police department. 
With the surge in federal officers there, ICE arrests have become quicker and quieter as agents avoid drawing crowds. ICE and Border Patrol have also been documented scanning the streets for people who may be immigrants, then asking those people to provide documentation. The American Civil Liberties Union is alleging immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens, in a lawsuit filed Thursday.
Without a sense yet of what may be in Maine’s future, organizers like Cron are prioritizing information gathering and meeting people’s basic needs. And, much of this work is rooted in previous iterations of mutual aid efforts.
For Presente!, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide food and resources to immigrants and others in need with schools closed and fear of exposure to the virus. 
“We’re hearing the same thing again,” Cron said, “but this time, the pathogen is ICE and racism.” 
Presente! and other community groups in the coalition began preparing for Trump’s mass deportation effort as soon as they saw the possibility coming.










We're hearing the same thing again, but this time, the pathogen is ICE and racism.


– Crystal Cron of Presente! Maine


Safiya Khalid, executive director of the Community Organizing Alliance, a Lewiston-based group boosting civic engagement among Black and immigrant communities, spearheaded the establishment of that coalition when Trump was reelected in 2024.
“We needed a plan and a strategy in place to support communities,” Khalid said, who was also the first Somali-American to serve on the Lewiston City Council. 
Khalid’s days are now busy further refining that strategy, but also filled with anxieties over what could happen. 
The Trump administration’s increased operations in Minneapolis specifically target Somali immigrants because of alleged welfare abuse. Similar accusations are being leveled in Maine.
Fear in Maine is visible. In Portland earlier this week, the superintendent reported multiple students absent from each school, citing concerns about immigration enforcement. A local school watch group started after a parent was detained by ICE in September after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school. 
The team at Khmer Maine, a Portland-based nonprofit serving the state’s Cambodian community, is reviewing their safety protocols to ensure its programming — such as citizenship preparatory courses and cultural events — can continue to be held without risking attendees safety. 
“We’re worried, of course,” said Executive Director Marpheen Chann, “but at the same time, what gives us comfort at Khmer Maine is that we’re not alone,” speaking to the broad network of organizations preparing for ICE’s arrival. 
Immigrant rights advocates and supporters held a press conference at Portland City Hall launching the Maine ICE Watch Hotline on Oct. 23, 2025. (Photo by Lauren McCauley/Maine Morning Star)
Chann is also running for Cumberland County commissioner, specifically to try to end the county jail’s contract with federal authorities to house immigration detainees. 
A group called No ICE for Maine has been turning out hundreds of people to board meetings to call for the contract’s termination, arguing that cooperation with federal immigration authorities makes the county complicit with their increasingly aggressive tactics. 
That push feels even more urgent now for member Jack O’Brien. “We hope the commissioners understand that this is why we’ve been talking about this for eight months,” O’Brien said. “There’s been a real frustration, I think, with a lot of the public that the commissioners have not taken the concerns about ICE as being legitimate.”
O’Brien, who is also a trained verifier for the hotline, has been connecting with anti-ICE protestors in Minnesota and elsewhere to get advice. He believes Maine’s organizing infrastructure sets the state up to be more proactive than other states. Part of that, he said, is because Maine is smaller than Minneapolis or Los Angeles, which has also faced major immigration raids. 
“It’s also that we’ve been able to learn from them as this horror has continued for them,” O’Brien said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_6435_720.jpg,,,2026-01-17 06:56:29.966775

The hundreds of Kansas who showed up at the Statehouse on Wednesday for a human rights rally understood that better than most. An array of civic organizations sponsored the event, which featured speakers, songs and chants — including a particularly pungent one directed at U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Yet the most memorable commentary could be seen throughout the crowd, thanks to dozens of handmade signs.
These signs, fashioned from poster board or even plain cardboard, varied in complexity. Some were colorful and artistic, others were hurriedly scrawled. What they shared was visceral outrage at our state and nation’s drift toward authoritarian violence. Most sharply criticized he Trump administration’s deployment of ICE agents against immigrants and protesters.
The death of Minneapolis mother Renee Good fueled Kansans’ anger. However, the crowd understood it as part of a broader effort, one meant to muffle resistance and grab ever more power for White House commissars.

Shared concerns
Throughout 2025, I thought we had reached various turning points against President Donald Trump‘s administration. There were the crude cuts by Elon Musk‘s Department of Governmental Efficiency. There were the attempted deportations of various legal immigrants. On the postive side, there were the October No Kings protests.
While all these events dinged Trump‘s popularity, it wasn’t until the government shut down that his administration finally took a serious hit.
The ongoing ICE raids — following a year of harsh tactics — have brought us to another fraught moment. In you listen closely, you can hear a difference in the way that even the most diehard Republicans talk about immigration and efforts at immigration enforcement.
Exhibit A? Longtime reporter Roy Wenzl’s story for the Journal of the Kansas Leadership Center: “Does Kansas need its immigrants despite crackdown? Key business leaders say ‘yes’ ”
Businesses, immigrants and community activists all agree that the current system doesn’t work. That was also the immigration system under former President Joe Biden and his predecessors. While many hoped that Trump would fix well-documented problems, he has instead spread chaos.
I don’t expect that Wenzl’s Republican sources will join demonstrators at the Statehouse anytime soon. However, their calls for a just and humane approach suggest that less division exists than generally supposed.
“Nobody from a city wants to move to western Kansas and work in slaughterhouses,” former state Sen. John Doll, R-Garden City, told the reporter. “It’s absurd to say those workers could be replaced by citizens. If they leave, southwest Kansas with its meatpacking plants will become a series of ghost towns.”
Most Americans, liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, want an approach to immigration that recognizes those who have spent years or decades in this country. A similarly broad coalition wants smart and effective security at our nation’s borders.
I doubt Trump or ICE will bring us to that space of agreement and compromise anytime soon. In fact, both seem dedicated to fanning the flames.
But underneath it all, the hope for something better remains.

Wes Moore joined 12 governors and two Trump administration officials pushing for power grid operator PJM Interconnection to bring $15 billion worth of new power online — with data centers paying the tab. PJM responded with its own plan.,"The massive computing power of data centers comes with a massive demand for energy, driving up demand for electricity and raising costs on all customers. Multistate electricity grid operator PJM and state and federal officials have their own ideas on how to fix that. (Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) found himself in a rare position Friday: Joining forces with President Donald Trump’s (R) administration on energy policy.
Moore was one of 13 governors who signed an agreement with the Trump administration, pushing for PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, to bring $15 billion worth of new power online — with data center companies paying the tab.
Moore has been a critic of PJM, arguing that its policies delayed new clean energy projects, which got stuck in a backlogged queue waiting for approval, and then electricity demand skyrocketed because of power-hungry data centers.
“I have been crystal clear: We cannot build a 21st-century economy on an energy market that blocks new supply,” Moore said in a statement Friday. “This moment calls for urgency. Maryland families and businesses must be served by a reliable grid without shouldering the cost of sky-high energy bills.”
But PJM’s Board of Directors released its own data center plan later Friday.
That plan also initiated a “backstop procurement” for new energy. But PJM merely directed its staff to study assigning the costs of new energy to the jurisdictions, who could then pass those costs to the data center companies, such as Amazon and Google.
PJM’s plan also encourages — but doesn’t mandate — “bring your own generation,” wherein data centers could choose to bring new power onto the system on an expedited basis, to defray the possibility of being asked to reduce their power demand when the grid is strained.

“This decision is about how PJM integrates large new loads in a way that preserves reliability for customers while creating a predictable, transparent path for growth,” said David Mills, PJM Board Chair and Interim President and CEO, in a statement.
“This is not a yes/no to data centers,” Mills’ statement said. “This is, ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’ We look forward to implementing, along with our stakeholders, these proposals to manage the phenomenal demand growth we are experiencing.”
PJM’s plan also includes changes to the way that the grid operator forecasts energy demand. Concerns had been raised that PJM’s projections were inflated, because companies looking to build data centers could be shopping the same data center proposal in more than one jurisdiction.
According to a news release from PJM, some of the items will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, while others can take place immediately.
Environmental groups argued Friday that PJM’s data center plan favors fossil fuels.
The Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that PJM’s decision protects “everyday families from blackouts” caused by data centers, but it falls short when it comes to new power generation.
PJM has created a “fast-track process that effectively excludes clean energy projects and gives special treatment to fossil fuel power plants built for data centers, allowing them to cut ahead of low-cost clean resources that have been waiting years to connect to the grid,” wrote Claire Lang-Ree, advocate for the Sustainable FERC Project at NRDC.
Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery) also chimed in, adding that PJM’s decision doesn’t provide sufficient protections for ratepayers.
“The primary fast-tracking of energy PJM is doing is biased towards fossil gas,” wrote Charkoudian, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee. “Given that solar and batteries are the fastest, cheapest way to provide new generation, this is another example of PJM serving for-profit energy companies and not families who can’t afford their energy bill.”

A Trump spokesperson called the administration’s plan with the governors an “unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts.”
“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities, and this would deliver much-needed, long-term relief to the Mid-Atlantic region,” wrote White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers in a statement.
The governors’ proposal would also have extended a cap on PJM’s energy capacity auction, which has lowered the price charged to ratepayers from the last several auctions, during which PJM procures energy supply to feed the grid in the future.
But PJM decided to request additional feedback about the cap before making a final decision.
Meanwhile, PJM executive director Jason Stanek was in Annapolis on Friday, speaking to a panel of legislators from Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, convened by Maryland’s conservative Freedom Caucus.
Stanek, a former Maryland utility regulator, argued that PJM has pursued multiple reforms to approve new energy projects more quickly.
“Despite what you may have heard, our interconnection queue is open, and PJM has been processing the connection of new, and mostly renewable, resources to connect to the grid at record pace,” Stanek said. “We soon hope to turn around requests in a period of one to two years, or possibly sooner.”
During his remarks, Stanek said that states own part of the blame for energy supply worries — and high electric bills, citing state-level energy policies and permitting procedures. He urged the legislators in the room to look inward as they aim to reduce prices.
“We would implore all of our states in the PJM region not to retire any more [power] resources until you have a sufficient amount of resources to backfill those retirements,” Stanek said.

“We would also ask that you look at your state permitting laws on the books to determine whether or not we can actually build energy infrastructure in your states in a timely manner.”
The Republicans in attendance were insistent that Maryland has contributed to its own power woes, by passing legislation to push the state away from fossil fuels — and toward a grid fueled by solar, wind and nuclear power. By law, Maryland has until 2031 to cut its carbon emissions 60% from 2006 levels.
“Why would politicians push to force the economy onto electricity while simultaneously shutting down the very power plants needed to generate it? It’s simple. Virtue signaling, green dreams over common sense,” said Del. Mark Fisher (R-Calvert).
Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore) said Friday that he was initially encouraged by the PJM governors’ announcement, because he agrees that data centers should pay for new power. But he remains concerned that Moore will focus on renewable sources, such as wind and solar, to supply that new power to the grid.
“Gov. Moore needs to embrace natural gas,” Hershey said. “He hasn’t done it yet. He’s trying to talk about nuclear, because it’s clean, but nuclear is 12 or 15 years out. As we heard today in this hearing, the quickest way to get reliable energy back on grid is to open up these retired fossil fuel generation facilities.”

This year, they are back with proposals, many of which are aimed at protecting their constituents from immigration raids that have put entire communities on edge.","A protester holds up a sign during a rally last month in support of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident whose detention and deportation became a national proxy for the debate over Trump administration immigration policy. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)One recent morning, Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) opened his computer to an email from a desperate family:  “Please help us locate our elderly family friend who has been detained,” it read.
“This is the moment we are in right now,” says Acevero, who serves as vice chair of the Maryland Latino Legislative Caucus. “We serve as the voice of the Latino and immigrant community to assure that we are reflecting their concerns and aspirations with legislation and a budget that is fair, equitable and meets the moment.”
Acevero says the caucus can use its 91 members – the largest caucus in Annapolis – to leverage its priorities to address fears like those in that short note.
In 2025, caucus members voted to support 55 pieces of legislation. Included in the 20 that were ultimately signed into law were inclusive policies for returning citizens, anti-poverty and housing policies, health care access, child welfare and transportation safety. Some that did not succeed last year have already been reintroduced this year and pushed to the top of the caucus’ agenda.
According to a Brookings Institution report, Maryland’s Latino community had a growth spurt in 2025 attracting 32,646 new residents, adding to the approximately 800,000 already living across the state, but largely in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties.
Barring police agreements with ICE
Acevero says in 2026 the caucus is resolute in its mission to combat federal government measures that target Latinos. That focus is on immigrant protection with three key bills. One would prohibit 287(g) agreements,  the collaborative agreements between local law enforcement agencies and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That provision was stripped from the 2025 Maryland Values Act on the last day of the 2o25 session.
More than 3,300 Marylanders were detained by ICE in 2025, twice the number of preceding years

Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince Georges), who sponsored the Values Act, says she will reintroduce the 287(g) measure as a standalone bill.  “I am very optimistic that it will pass because we have really great partners in the Senate who are committed to ensuring that this bill passes this session,” she said.
Among those partners is Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City). Another is House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s), who told Maryland Matters, that she also supports the measure.
“I think it’s important, especially given the climate that we have presently in this country,” said Peña-Melnyk, a native of the Dominican Republic. “The states have to act. This is a way for us to tell our immigrant community, ‘We love you. You’re part of us. We see you. We hear you, and we want to give you protection,’ and that’s why this is important.”
Williams anticipates opposition from the Maryland counties that have signed 287(g) cooperative agreements, eight in total. Arguing for their termination, she says the stand-alone bill promotes greater trust and better relations with the police in the long run.
“We want to make sure that people feel comfortable reporting crimes to the police, engaging with our local officers, and that our officers are engaging in community policing, where the community feels as though they are part of it,” Williams said.
Other priority protection bills
Two other bills among caucus priorities include House Bill 155, also drafted by Williams, which would bar on-duty law enforcement officers from wearing masks or disguises when interacting with the public. Senate Bill 1 is the companion measure in the Senate.
The other from Del. Vaughn Stewart (D-Montgomery) would bar ICE arrests in courthouses. The measure would build on the sensitive location guidelines of the Maryland Values Act that restricts federal enforcement agents from schools, churches, libraries, places of worship, hospitals, clinics and community shelters.
Among the caucus members seven are of Latino heritage – the other 84 associate members support caucus priorities.  They have crafted dozens of bills, which at their core are immigrant related, but have a broader reach. “I’m coming into this session with a pretty comprehensive agenda around affordability and workers’ rights,” said Del. Joe Vogel (D-Montgomery), whose parents brought him to the United States from Uruguay at age 3 in 2000.

Elected to the House in 2022, he is now the caucus secretary. “I spent the last nine months, both here in my district – Gaithersburg and Rockville – and then in other parts of the state hearing directly from Marylanders, from immigrants, who are really hurting now, fearful of the federal government and struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living,” he said.
Caucus Treasurer Del. Deni Taveras, a Dominican American, also has several prospective bills with immigrants in mind, ranging from developmental disability service for Latino families, an anti-price gouging housing bill, and legislation around teen pregnancy, chronic truancy and drug addiction among Latinos.
‘We cannot afford to be silent’
Caucus delegate Teresa Woorman (D-Montgomery) immigrated from Puebla, Mexico, as a child, became a naturalized citizen in college and served as a long-term staffer in the General Assembly before she began her first term as a legislator in 2025.
This year she strongly supports the Latino Caucus agenda, with bills of her own that include working with Peña-Melnyk to tweak a law that would put in-state tuition for undocumented students on parity with neighboring states.
She says while her constituents live in Bethesda and Potomac, areas with much less threatened by ICE,  “When I go door-knocking, people are worried about what they see on their TVs, what’s happening across the whole country,” she said.  “And I tell them I feel like we are [in Annapolis] as the first line of defense to protect what we can at the state level.”
Acevedo is ready for the fight.
“What we are seeing is a federal government that is targeting hard working Marylanders and immigrants who have come to this country and who have called this country home for decades,” he said.  “We are going to continue to push legislation, raise our voices. We are going to be in the streets shoulder to shoulder with our partners and our allies to call out this administration.  We cannot afford to be silent.”

J. Sandy Bartlett, and the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee wastes no time getting into the nitty-gritty of bill hearings, in political notes.","Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel) has reason to smile after being elevated from vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee last year to chair this year, the first woman and first person of color to hold the seat. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Department of Legislative Services is the keeper of all legislative arcana, among other things. So it was able to respond relatively quickly this week to a request for information about House Judiciary Committee leadership, spitting out a list of chairs — or, more strictly, chairmen — dating back to 1828.
They might want to put an asterisk next to this year’s entry.
Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), recently elevated from vice chair of Judiciary, is not just the first woman to make that 198-year list of committee chairs, she is also the first person of color to chair the committee. She was appointed by new House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), who made former Judiciary Chair Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) her speaker pro tem.
Del. Debra Davis (D-Charles) was named vice chair, making the Judiciary Committee the only standing committee this year chaired by two Black women.
“We have quite a team. We have the dream team here, I hope. I think we do,” Bartlett said during an organizational hearing for the committee this week.
“We do,” Davis replied.
In an interview Friday, Bartlett said she was grateful for the chance to serve as chair, which she said comes with a “strong sense of responsibility.” She said she thinks about her ancestors when serving in the legislature, including her great-grandfather Bryant William Thorpe, one of four Black state legislators in North Carolina in 1885.
Peña-Melnyk unveils House leadership shake-up, expands standing committees

“I am just so grateful. It hasn’t even really completely hit me yet because I stand on the shoulders of other people, but I know it’s special,” Bartlett said. “I know it’s historic, and I appreciate it.”
It’s not the first committee to be led by two Black women: Last year, the House Ways and Means Committee was chaired by Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard) and the vice chair was Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery). When Atterbeary stepped down this year to focus on her race for Howard County executive, Wilkins was made chair. Her vice chair is Del. Jessica Feldmark (D-Howard).
The only other standing committee led by two Black legislators is Senate Executive Nominations chaired by Sen. Benjamins Brooks (D-Baltimore County) and Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s) as the vice chair.
Burning the candle at both ends
The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee got its nickname, “JPR after dark,” for its habit of holding hearings well into the night to handle its significant workload during previous legislative sessions.
Now, it appears the committee has started burning the candle at both ends.
Committee Manager Sandy Popp informed the committee during an organizational meeting Thursday that the committee had already scheduled 58 prefiled bills to be heard this month, a little more than a fifth of the 273 bills that had been submitted to the full Senate as of Friday. Popp said that’s down from the 75 prefiled bills the committee started with last year.
Hearings will begin Tuesday and be packed in over the next 10 days. (The Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee is keeping pace with 65 bill hearings scheduled, but those start Wednesday and are currently scheduled through mid-February.)
“The work that we do here is, I think, most directly connected to how people move about their everyday lives, and you’ll see that through testimony,” said Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of the committee.
And the committee has not packed the calendar with softball bills. About 31 bills will be reviewed next week on topics that include estates and trusts, family law and criminal law. But there is also a potentially a high-octane hearing Thursday when the committee hears Senate Bill 1, prohibiting face coverings for law enforcement officers in the state, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers; and SB 245, prohibiting a county sheriff, local police or any “agent of the state” from entering into an agreement with the federal government to enforce civil immigration law.

Put simply, SB 245 would ban 287(g) agreements with ICE. That language was stripped out of larger bill on the last day of the 2025 session, original sponsor Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) reintroduced it this year with two heavyweight co-sponsors: Smith, the committee chair, and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City).
SB 1, sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s),follows months of aggressive immigration raids by ICE agents who are typically masked. The scrutiny intensified after Renee Good, 37, was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis this month. Augustine’s bill would prohibit officers from wearing items such as a balaclava, ski mask or neck gaiter on duty. It wouldn’t apply to an individual “actively engaged in an undercover operation.”
Ferguson and Pena-Melnyk have both expressed support for the measure.
“I think all of us can sit back and imagine if you’re sitting in your car and somebody runs up to you, even as a law enforcement agent that quickly shows us a badge and has their face covered, I know I would be terrified,” Ferguson said Wednesday to reporter. “It’s just not how you build trust in policing.”
But Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick), a Judicial Proceedings member who recently retired from the Frederick Police Department, said law enforcement officers in the state usually do not wear face coverings unless it’s due to inclement weather. He said masked federal officers “are trying to actually find a way to protect themselves and their families from being doxed by certain activists who make it their mission to cause disruption … in the performance of their duties.”
“I find it interesting that the state of Maryland wants to legislate a policy for federal law enforcement officers,” Folden said.
Bartlett could not say when the House version of the masking bill, sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), might be heard in the Judiciary Committee.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A federal judge gave a significant victory to Minnesota protesters and observers of federal officers Friday, granting a preliminary injunction preventing the officers from retaliating against demonstrators.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting or detaining people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of 3,000 immigration officers and agents here. The Reformer talked to a protester who was detained for hours on Sunday and never charged.
The federal agents can no longer use pepper spray or other nonlethal munitions against people engaged in peaceful protest. They cannot stop or detain drivers where there is no “reasonable, articulable suspicion” that they are interfering.
ICE observers are frequently following cars they suspect are being driven by federal officers, tracking them, entering vehicle descriptions into a database and discouraging them from making immigrant arrests. The judge declared this legal and a protected activity: “The act of safely following (federal agents) at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop.”
The ruling comes out of a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU.
The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year as the agency ramped up raids in Minnesota, especially in the state’s large Somali community.
Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs, pulled up to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer. 
“I was genuinely afraid I was being kidnapped,” Tincher said at a press conference Wednesday.
The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_661-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 22:57:57.238603

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA  — U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, asking her federal department to “block” the closure of the Tyson beef plant in Lexington, Nebraska. 
Schumer, in the letter, pointed to the Packers and Stockyards Act, saying the upcoming closure in Lexington is a “textbook violation” of the century-old federal law. The New York Democrat said the closure will send “shockwaves through America’s cattle market.”

“[USDA] publicly stated it is ‘closely monitoring’ the planned closure of large processors like Tyson’s Lexington plant, yet has offered little clarity on whether that monitoring includes active investigation, enforcement, or any concrete steps to protect producers and competition … I urge you to act swiftly to preserve competition, help bring prices down for families and farmers, and save jobs,” Schumer’s letter reads. 
The Packers and Stockyards Act, passed in 1921, was meant to promote competitiveness and fair practices in the livestock, meat and poultry industries — and to ensure payment protection.

The law prohibits deception and fraud in those markets. Some have questioned whether the feds have the authority to do so. The Packers and Stockyards Act does give the Agriculture Department the authority to force Tyson to sell the plant.  
Ricketts, during a campaign event Friday in Omaha, told the Examiner he had talked to Tyson to “encourage them to quickly make a decision about the plant and to keep it open.” He said he also is working to connect people affected by the closure with help finding jobs. 
“I think about the disaster that’s going on in Lexington … like a natural disaster,” Ricketts said, “so it’s locally executed, state supported or state managed, federally supported [and] we’re supporting the state of Nebraska.” 
Lexington is likely see 3,200 workers lose their jobs. The statewide economic loss, including both direct and ripple effects, has been estimated at $3.28 billion a year, according to a University of Nebraska-Lincoln Bureau of Business Research analysis. 
The west-central Nebraska city is home to more than 10,000 people.

State agencies have partnered with Lexington nonprofits and other groups to support the affected workers. Gov. Jim Pillen told the press after his State of the State address that he is “pushing at every meeting” with Tyson to decide the future of the plant “sooner than later.”  
Tyson has not scheduled any shifts at the Lexington facility this week, according to Farm Journal.
The letter from Schumer comes after Ricketts’ Senate race opponent this fall, registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn, used a campaign appearance in Lexington to highlight the plant’s loss. He accused the company of breaking the century-old law. Tyson also is reducing its operations in a plant in Amarillo, in the Texas panhandle.
The Ricketts campaign said Schumer is “amplifying Osborn’s political grandstanding.”  
“Dan Osborn will be a consistent yes vote for Schumer’s far-left agenda. … It’s why Schumer spent $3.85 million on Osborn’s last campaign,” said Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson. “Nebraskans will see through these political games.” 
Dan Osborn said the interest from Washington is “too little and too late.”

“The workers and their families in Lexington are the latest to have the rug pulled out from under them by corporate greed. … Where has Pete Ricketts been on all this?” Osborn asked. 
Nebraska also lost a Tyson plant in 2006 in Norfolk. U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, a Republican from Norfolk representing the 1st Congressional District, has said Tyson “stripped the plant bare” and the property couldn’t be used as a beef processing facility. Flood said the plant still sits empty today. 
Tyson’s Lexington plant is set to close next week.

The suit filed in Lafayette County came a week after the NCAA denied Ole Miss’ request for an extra year, saying the university and Chambliss’ previous school — Ferris State — failed to provide adequate medical documentation to back up the request.
The lawsuit filed Friday called the NCAA’s denial in “bad-faith, unreasonable and arbitrary,” and detailed Chambliss’ history of illness and included letters from physicians.
“Despite the duty of good faith and fair dealing it owes to Trinidad, the NCAA insists on considering the evidence in Trinidad’s case in an isolated, rather than comprehensive manner; interpreting its rules to impose requirements not contained therein; taking unreasonable if not irrational positions; and acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner in its decision-making and ruling,” the suit says.
Ole Miss’ arguments revolve around the fact that the 23-year-old Chambliss, although he has been in college for five years, has only played three years of college football because of that medical history.
“Trinidad first enrolled in Ferris State in the fall of 2021, but medical and physical incapacity prevented his ability to adequately train and condition and develop athletically,” the suit says.
After taking a redshirt his first season at Ferris State in 2021-22, Chambliss was held out in his second season for medical reasons.
“Obviously, Trinidad’s medical conditions, which rendered him incapable of competing in any game during these years, were beyond his or Ferris State’s control,” the suit says.
He played two more seasons at the Division II school in Michigan, leading the Bulldogs to a national championship before transferring to Ole Miss before the start of this season.
Chambliss completed 294 of 445 passes (66.1%) for 3,937 yards with 22 touchdowns and three interceptions for Ole Miss (13-2), which set a school record for wins, including two after making the College Football Playoff for the first time. He ran for 527 yards and eight more TDs.
The Rebels lost 31-27 to Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinals on Jan. 8.
The NCAA, when contacted Friday, did not have a new statement, but referred to its statement from a week ago saying “This decision aligns with consistent application of NCAA rules.”
The NCAA said in that week-old statement that approval of such waivers requires schools to submit medical documentation from a treating physician at the time of a student’s incapacitating injury or illness.
“The documents provided by Ole Miss and the student’s prior school include a physician’s note from a December 2022 visit, which stated the student-athlete was ‘doing very well’ since he was seen in August 2022,” the NCAA said. “Additionally, the student-athlete’s prior school indicated it had no documentation on medical treatment, injury reports or medical conditions involving the student-athlete during that time frame and cited ‘developmental needs and our team’s competitive circumstances’ as its reason the student-athlete did not play in the 2022-23 season.”

Kyrsten Sinema was asked to describe the world’s current chapter in history during a Salt Lake City event, the question was almost unintelligible, obstructed by the yells of a heckler and the quick movement of security officers dragging him outside.
“Disruptive,” Sinema said, “and I promise I didn’t plan for that.”
A few minutes later, a second heckler appeared interrupting the session as well. Both of them yelled they were having affairs with Sinema, a nod to the news of a lawsuit filed against her for “alienation of affection” after being accused of having an affair with a former member of her security team.
Sinema, currently an adviser for a law and lobbying firm and for cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, was visiting Salt Lake City on Friday to speak on a panel about policy and partnerships with Gov. Spencer Cox and Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute Director Natalie Gochnour, part of the Utah Chamber and Gardner Institute’s Utah Economic Outlook and Public Policy Summit.

After the interruptions, Sinema continued her thoughts on what she described as “a period of incredible disruption,” especially with the emergence of artificial intelligence technologies.

“So AI is changing the way that we work and the way that we interact with each other. It will also change the way that we consider jobs,” she said. “Jobs will look different in the future, and there’s always a period of disruption. This has been true since the invention of electricity, right? Since the invention of the internet, right?”
The discussion followed the presentation of the annual Economic Report to the Governor from the Gardner Institute, which made projections of moderate economic expansion for the state throughout 2026. 
The institute also projected 1.3% population growth in Utah from 2026 to 2027 — the same population growth calculated in 2025. That would outpace the national average, but at the same time, represents a slower rate than the state’s historical trend. 
And while the state remains the youngest in the country, the population is aging, reports from the Gardner Institute say.

One of Cox’s concerns, he said on Friday, is to be prepared “when that silver tsunami hits us,” but also, he worries about the decline of the state’s fertility rate.
“Our society is a pyramid scheme. It is, and it always has been, and that’s a very positive thing,” he said, prompting some laughs. “We need those next generations. Now that doesn’t even touch on our social safety nets and what happens when you don’t have the workers who are paying the taxes to deliver the social security that people are relying on to retire, we are screwed if we don’t have that.”
Sinema agreed with Cox, saying that if nothing changes at the federal level, by the time she and the governor reach retirement age, “there will be no social security.”
Cox had mostly kind words for business representatives who attended the summit. But, he finished his remarks warning that he was about to be blunt with them.
“You’ve abandoned us. You have. We do not see the business community on Capitol Hill like we did when I started this 10 years ago. It’s not even close,” he said. “Everybody just kind of does their thing, and they’ll complain about legislation, but they don’t show up.”
He urged them to also find other people to be at the Legislature if they are unhappy with its results.
“Some of you need to run for the Legislature, we need you. We desperately need you,” he said.
Sinema had a similar message, but for everyone in the country.
“If you don’t like the tone, if you don’t like the ugliness, if you think, ‘Gosh, this is distasteful,’ the thing we’ve got to remember is that we as Americans, we built this. This is us,” she said. “We created it, so we choose who we put in these positions. We choose who to reward, we choose who to punish.”
When asked about Utah’s culture and social cohesion, Sinema said that having spent a significant portion of her life in the state, she knows it’s “a very special place.”
“Utahns, with two notable exceptions today,” she said, “are just very generous, kind.”

We cannot sustain world-class institutions if we squeeze workers and residents who make them run. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Narain Batra: Growth is pushing the Upper Valley to breaking point.","This commentary is by Narain Batra, a professor, historian, journalist and author whose work spans freedom, artificial intelligence, media and geopolitics. 



The Upper Valley, a most extraordinary economic and cultural heartbeat of the vast twin-state region, is currently at a turning point where outstanding institutional growth is colliding with a bucolic infrastructure that’s pushing against its limits and raising the question of affordability.
The colossal footprint of Dartmouth Health remains the region’s major economic driver. The final phases of the Patient Pavilion at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) are scheduled for completion in August 2026, adding new inpatient beds and specialized units, according to Tom Manion, DHMC’s chief operating officer. 
But its expansion is reaching a critical threshold, and the so-called Upper Valley paradox — it is building beds for patients but lacks roofs for staff — is evident. 
Dartmouth College is doing its part to mitigate the housing crunch through its Sugarwood Circle project in West Lebanon, a $15.2 million development specifically for Dartmouth employees.
It is slated for initial occupancy in January 2026, as part of President Sian Leah Beilock’s commitment to add 1,000 beds for faculty, staff, and students in the next 10 years.
Keeping affordability expectations in mind, the “company town” model could perhaps become a primary survival strategy for major employers in the Upper Valley: most of the stores, businesses, and housing in the town would be partially or fully owned by the same company that is also the main employer. 
Consider this: as of late 2025, the median home price in Grafton County surged 12.4%, almost triple the statewide average, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. 
Lawmakers in both Concord and Montpelier are facing rebellion from business leaders who argue that 1970s-era regulations are strangling growth. 
The Vermont Chamber’s 2026 Legislative Priorities emphasize “workforce and housing alignment” and the need for regulatory predictability.
According to the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, “Affordability pressures, demographic decline, and rising operating costs are converging just as our state needs more workers, more housing, and greater predictability to sustain economic growth.” 
For Upper Valley residents, 2026 will raise questions about zoning laws and whether they can combine new housing opportunities with environmental preservation. The question is no longer if the region must change, but how fast it can adapt its legal framework to keep pace with its economic potential. 
The most disquieting question of 2026 is what might be termed the property tax shock. As towns upgrade infrastructure to support growth, sooner or later, the bill will arrive. 
Vermont homeowners are facing a projected average 12% education property tax increase in 2026, driven by rising school costs. For the average homeowner in the Upper Valley, rising home valuations are no longer viewed as a wealth gain but a liability. 
Property tax bills jump while the local school district is still forced to cut staff, which, to residents like me, seems a cruel joke.
The Upper Valley’s labor crisis has been worsened by federal policy. Deportations and intensified Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, such as the recent high-profile actions against farmworkers in the Champlain Valley and Upper Valley dairy farms, have created a chilling effect that extends far beyond the undocumented community. 
Dairy farmers in the region, who are largely ineligible for the H-2A seasonal visa program, are facing serious threats. According to the Business & Human Rights Centre, many workers are now afraid to leave the farms to get basic necessities. The loss of even a few key milkers can force a multigeneration family farm to close down.
In New Hampshire, the landscape shifted drastically on Jan. 1 as new anti-sanctuary laws took full effect. Communities like Lebanon and Hanover have been forced to amend their ordinances to allow police cooperation with ICE or face state penalties of up to 25% of their funding.
With deaths now outnumbering births in the region, growth is almost entirely predicated on migration. International migrants fill a disproportionate share of essential roles in health care, manufacturing and domestic services, according to USA Facts. 
The Upper Valley in 2026 is a microcosm of the modern American dilemma: high-tech and high-demand, but low inventory in housing and labor. 
It’s a region with a “We Are Hiring” sign permanently affixed to its front door, finally realizing it cannot sustain its world class institutions if it continues to squeeze the workers and residents who make them run.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The U.S. Justice Department has issued subpoenas to Gov. Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey as part of a criminal investigation into whether they’ve impeded federal immigration enforcement, the Washington Post reported Friday.
The investigation intensifies an already combustible conflict between the feds and Minnesota, while also adding to the DOJ’s list of targets deemed enemies by President Donald Trump and his administration. 
A DOJ spokesperson declined comment. 
Walz’s office said he hadn’t received any notice of investigation. 
Walz replied in a statement to the news: “Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly,” he said, referring to the U.S. senators who made a video telling U.S. servicemembers that they can and must refuse illegal orders, as well as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who has refused to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump desires. “Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” Walz said. 
Frey called the investigation “an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement and our residents against the chaos and danger this administration has brought to our streets.” 
He added: “I will not be intimidated.” 
The Post reported that “the subpoenas suggest that the Justice Department is examining whether Walz’s and Frey’s public statements disparaging the surge of officers and federal actions have amounted to criminal interference in law enforcement work.”
Walz, who announced earlier this month he won’t seek a third term, also used his statement to criticize the federal government for not properly investigating the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross. “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her,” he said.   
Six prosecutors in the Minnesota Office of U.S. Attorney quit this week, The New York Times reported, because they objected to their bosses’ push to investigate the widow of Good and their ties to anti-ICE groups. 
The ICE surge, which has put as many as 3,000 federal agents in the state — or nearly five times the number of sworn officers with the Minneapolis Police Department — is just the latest round of an ongoing conflict between Minnesota and the federal government. Fraud in Minnesota’s social programs — often funded in whole or part by the federal government — has caught the attention of right-wing media and activists, and the Trump administration has followed with a wide array of investigations of Minnesota programs across a range of agencies.  
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is auditing Hennepin Healthcare — Minnesota’s largest safety net hospital — for compliance with immigrant employment eligibility laws.
The Trump administration has frozen child care payments and halted small business grants. The administration also says it’s investigating possible housing assistance fraud and looking into Minnesota’s unemployment insurance program. The federal government has also attempted to withhold funds to Minnesota for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, but a federal court issued a preliminary injunction.
Earlier this week, Trump said he would cut all federal funding to Minnesota and other states that have sanctuary cities beginning Feb. 1, but it’s unclear what that means and few details have been released.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9332-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 20:57:41.157388

(Photo by Jeremy Edwards/Federal Emergency Management Agency)Landslides, storm-driven floods, infrastructure-damaging permafrost thaw and intensifying wildfires are among the expensive disasters that scientists link to Alaska’s rapidly changing climate.
Now a state legislator is proposing to levy a 20-cent surcharge on every barrel of Alaska-produced oil to fund programs that respond to and prepare for disasters related to climate change.
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, introduced the measure, House Bill 247, in advance of the legislative session scheduled to start on Jan. 20.
To explain why the state needs such a fund, Josephson ticked off a list of recent disasters in Alaska that imposed heavy costs — and, in some cases, killed people. Those events, which include deadly landslides in Southeast Alaska, landslides that have blocked roads, severe flooding in Western Alaska last October from the remnants of Typhoon Halong and similar damage in 2022 from the remnants of Typhoon Merbok, all had some links to climate change that is caused by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning, he said.
“It’s a true statement that a lot of the disaster dollars we need right now are related to climate change. That, in my opinion, is sort of inarguable,” he said.
Disasters like those that have occurred in recent years are expected to continue in the future, he said: “We’re in a new normal.”
The bill is logical from a fiscal standpoint, Josephson said.
As of now, the state’s disaster relief fund is “basically a sub-fund of the general fund,” and it gets whatever lawmakers are able to appropriate, he said. But if there is a new stream of money as proposed by his bill, “we would free up those dollars we’re otherwise spending in the disaster relief fund.”
At 20 cents per barrel, the proposed surcharge would raise about $30 million a year, he said.
In comparison, Gov. Mike Dunleavy in December proposed that lawmakers approve a $40 million appropriation for the state’s existing disaster relief fund. The need could increase from that total if the Trump administration fails to reimburse 100% of the costs for Typhoon Halong relief rather than the normal 75%. The Biden administration in 2022 approved 100% reimbursement for Merbok-related costs.
As introduced by Josephson, the bill would give the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation oversight over the money generated by the surcharge. It would distribute fund money in the form of grants to local governments and other entities for purposes like disaster response, disaster preparation and upgrades that make infrastructure better protected against climate change.
The surcharge idea has precedent in Alaska. The Department of Environmental Conservation already administers another fund with money coming from a per-barrel fee on oil produced in the state.

	After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, the state began levying a 5-cent-per-barrel surcharge on oil that goes into the state’s Oil and Hazardous Substance Release Prevention and Response Fund. The fund itself was created by the legislature in 1986, with the surcharge established after the disastrous Prince William Sound spill.
That surcharge and rules concerning the fund’s operations have been modified over the years, broadening the purposes for which the fund can be used and boosting DEC’s reporting requirements, according to the department.
In its current configuration, each 5-cent-per-barrel surcharge sends 1 cent into a spill response account, to be used for spills that have been officially declared disasters. The other 4 cents goes into a spill prevention account, which can be used to address spills that have not been declared disasters, among other functions.
In 2015, refined petroleum products were added to the program. The state added a small surcharge, 0.95 cents per gallon, on refined fuel projects sold, transferred or used at the wholesale level, according to the DEC.
The idea of a similar levy to raise money for climate change preparedness and response is not new.
Rick Steiner, a retired University of Alaska marine conservation professor who founded and leads an environmental organization called Oasis Earth, has been advocating for the approach for several years.
“The legislature has so far seemed unable or unwilling to connect the dots between the many climate-related disasters we are experiencing — typhoon Merbok, wildfires, landslides, floods, coastal erosion, permafrost thaw, storm damage, infrastructure damage, subsistence impacts, commercial fishing impacts, etc..– to see the larger picture of the threat and costs these interrelated climate disasters pose,” he said in a letter to lawmakers sent last September. “The money to address these issues will have to come from government.”
In advocating for what he called an Alaska Climate Resilience Fund, Steiner said funding issues have become more pressing because of federal cutbacks.
The climate-response surcharge idea is not unique to Alaska, either.
Hawaii has put its version of a climate surcharge into law, a measure that seeks to raise money for responses to future disasters like the deadly 2023 Lahaina wildfire on the island of Maui.
In May, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a Democrat, signed a bill that increases the state’s hotel and lodging tax by less than a percentage point. The increase is applied to the state’s Transient Accommodations Tax, known at TAT. The governor said the increase would amount to an additional charge of about $3 on a $400-a-night hotel room fee. It is expected to generate about $100 million a year, according to state officials.

Hoskinson Health Wellness Clinic's owner, Charles Hoskinson, also laid off 136 workers from his Gillette-based construction and concrete businesses in December.
The post Gillette clinic lays off around 40 people appeared first on WyoFile .","The Hoskinson Health Wellness Clinic announced plans Friday to eliminate around 40 positions at its Gillette medical facility. 
The clinic, which opened in 2022, said it’s not at risk of closing. It will continue serving 20,000 patients with a staff of around 250 employees, according to a clinic spokesperson. Patients affected by discontinued services will be notified directly. 
“To continue fulfilling its original goal of improving rural health care, the Clinic must come to terms with some harsh realities that have hurt its ability to perform in an efficient manner,” a clinic press release stated.
The clinic, along with construction and concrete businesses in Gillette that laid off a combined 136 workers in December, were founded by Charles Hoskinson, CEO and founder of Input Output Group. 
Declining reimbursement rates, escalating costs, including high provider salaries, and the facility’s payer mix were listed as factors driving the staff reduction in the clinic’s press release. 
“To ensure the Clinic can continue serving the people of Gillette and Northeast Wyoming who depend on us, the health care facility must operate in a significantly more cost-effective manner,” the release said. 
The layoff comes as Wyoming residents face mounting obstacles to health care access. Hospitals have shut down services like delivery wards in recent years, patients increasingly drive long distances for specialty care and state residents insured on the Affordable Care Act marketplace are experiencing the highest premium increases nationwide because Congress did not extend tax subsidies. 
“Hoskinson has been a key source of care for Gillette and surrounding communities, helping residents access medical services close to home,” Wyoming Health Resources Network Executive Director Amanda Teppo said. “Like many rural and frontier providers across Wyoming, it is facing financial pressures from rising costs and ongoing workforce shortages.
“While specific service changes are not yet known, reduced staffing could mean longer wait times, fewer care options, and increased strain on patients, providers, and emergency services,” she continued. “These challenges reflect the broader struggle to sustain reliable, accessible health care in rural and frontier communities throughout Wyoming.” 
Layoffs across town 
Hoskinson companies announced in December a combined 123 layoffs among its construction and concrete businesses in Gillette and that Hoskinson Concrete would be permanently closed. The actual number of layoffs in December was 136, a spokesperson told WyoFile on Friday.
Though some employees dispute this, the December job cuts were anticipated, according to the Hoskinson firm.
“The large-scale construction needs that led the clinic to create an in-house construction company have come to an end,” Hoskinson Contracting CEO Chris Davis said in a press statement at the time. “As a result, Hoskinson Contracting is scaling back its operations, and the Hoskinson Concrete division is being closed.”
Every laid-off employee would remain on payroll through January, a Hoskinson spokesperson told WyoFile at the time. A spokesperson confirmed the information with WyoFile on Friday.
Workers affected by layoffs can reach out to the Gillette Workforce Center, state workforce officials have advised. Job seekers can look for employment and register at the HireWyo website.

Furthermore, the lawsuit alleges that the seed company, Nutrien Ag Solutions, as well as its partner, the Montana Seed Growers Association, have known about an abusive pattern by the colony’s men, but rely on the Hutterite colony’s business and so disregarded the claims, even though court documents say the company investigated the allegation and found the company should have taken steps to make the workplace more secure.
The incident involves several interactions with male members of the Hilldale Colony and the Nutrien facility in Havre. The lawsuit accuses Leonard J. Waldner of sexually assaulting the victim, and says that the religious colony leaders have actually helped the man escape to Canada.
A request for comment by Nutrien went unanswered Friday by time of publication.
Court documents filed in Missoula County District Court say that early in her employment the victim raised safety concerns because she was sometimes the only employee at the facility. She requested Nutrien install security cameras, as she was also worried about vandalism. In the court filing, she also said that the company has a very specific policy against the use of deadly force and has a policy which outlaws pepper spray and tasers.
“Nutrien refused, claiming it was too expensive, delaying the installation of cameras due to only allowing approved vendors (on site),” the lawsuit said.
The victim renewed her request after an April 8, 2024 incident in which she recalled a semi-truck pulling up just as she was leaving work. It appeared the man, an unidentified Hutterite worker, needed help unloading pallets. She said the man asked if she was alone, and she told him she’d quickly unload them.
“Take your time, please. I like to watch a woman work,” the court documents said.
“He then watched the plaintiff very closely as she bent over to unload the pallets, making her physically uncomfortable,” the documents said.
When the victim told her supervisors about it, her boss said that he would be fired because of it, but seemed to blame the victim for not addressing it herself.
She then renewed her request for security cameras. According to the court filing, Nutrien did not install cameras.
On Oct. 17, 2024, she was working around lunch when the other employee was making deliveries. That’s when she interacted with Waldner. Often, the documents say, Hutterite colony workers would bring produce for sale, and she asked if they had any pumpkin pies. Though he said no, they agreed she’d buy one of their turkeys. As Waldner was leaving he stretched his arms to give her a hug, and she “awkwardly complied.”
“She felt uncomfortable, and even more so when Waldner whispered to her, ‘This is just between you and me,’” the court documents said.
The victim went back inside the office and saw the truck pull behind the building. He appeared in her office and brought her a pie. Notably, the victim said he had never come inside the office. He then walked around to her desk and looked at her family photos. The court documents record the alleged conversation:
“Isn’t it fun,” he asked.
She replied that she loved her family.
“No, the best part — and why I have five kids — is making them,” he said, recounting how nice the hug from her was.
Waldner asked about her coworker and she replied that he was at another colony.
“They sure leave you alone a lot and without cameras,” he said, according to court documents.
At that point, the court documents say that he physically moved toward her, pinning her with his legs, arms and body grabbing at her chest and pants. He pulled her pants down. She recounted that she feared if she tried to fight, he’d only become more aggressive, but felt him kissing her and making noises. When he stopped, he went to the bathroom, and the victim noted semen on the floor.
She told a coworker and then called her husband.
“They immediately called to report the assault to Havre Police Department. When (the victim) was put on the phone to try to tell police what had happened, she could not stop crying or calm down enough to articulate everything that had just occurred,” the court filing said.
The lawsuit alleges that the Havre Police never did follow up and Waldner was never questioned. She also reported the incident to Nutrien.
As a result, the lawsuit said she has been through therapy and has post-traumatic stress disorder after the assault.
According to court documents, when Nutrien investigated the assault, it found that she needed mental health support because of the “assaults and violent acts.” The report also said that the incidents also occurred within “Nutrien’s zone of influence” and that the company would need to further review “systemic deficiencies.”
Even after the incident, the victim witnessed three men from the Hilldale Colony telling the victim when she was alone, “You still don’t have cameras, huh?”
  Scope of the lawsuit 

The lawsuit doesn’t just describe the alleged incident in Hill County or Nutrien’s role. It also claims that the other defendants in the lawsuit, including the colony, and the Montana Seed Growers knew about this problem, and had documented other incidents.
The victim was employed by the Seed Growers to perform seed inspections and the organization had a rule about field inspections: Women were not allowed to conduct them alone because of the “Hutterite men like Waldner had a propensity to treat female MSGA employees in an unsafe manner.”
“Despite a known risk of sexual violence and o/or sexual harassment that Hutterite men like Waldner pose to women in the ag industry, the industry does not talk about it, warn women or take meaningful action to prevent it,” the lawsuit said. “The Hutterites’ business is important to the ag industry and defendants here put business over women’s safety.”
The lawsuit said that Nutrien’s general manager said that normally they’d cut off a client, in this case, the Hutterites, which engaged in behavior like this.
“But the accounts are too lucrative for Nutrien to do so,” the lawsuit said. “The Safety and Health Advisor for Nutrien communicated to the plaintiff that Hutterites are important because they keep prices low for the little farmers by buying in bulk.”
The lawsuit alleges a female employee at a Nutrien location in Idaho was attacked by a Hutterite truck driver and left her job. It also states that a woman working at a different Nutrien branch was attacked at approximately the same time and the company did nothing to remedy the problem, or take future actions to protect or warn employees.
The lawsuit said that all organizations knew about the behavior and did nothing to stop it, and the colony is being sued because Waldner was an employee and it should have taken precautions.
“Our aim is not only to secure justice, but to hold fully accountable all those who failed in their duty to protect her and to ensure meaningful change is implemented to protect other women working in Montana’s agricultural industry,” said attorney Michelle Simpson Tuegel.

“We all make mistakes, and that doesn’t mean you can’t change,” said Kitty O’Hara, the longest-serving volunteer at the Hartford Community Restorative Justice Center.

This story by Sophia Langlois was first published in Valley News on Jan. 13, 2026.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — Isaiah Taylor recalls growing up in Woodsville in an extended family beset by violence and drugs. When he sought help for his addiction as a teenager, he felt no one would listen.
After seven years of incarceration for various crimes, Taylor, now 29, has spent the past year and a half rebuilding his life with help from the Hartford Community Restorative Justice Center, or HCRJC, which guided him as he reentered the job market and secured housing, he said. Its volunteers listened and empathized. 
“It’s not only breaking the cycle of addiction and abuse, but being a better parent to my kid and being a good partner,” said Taylor in an interview earlier this month at the Listen Dining Hall where he now works.
The Justice Center, first established in 2003, is a nonprofit organization that provides community housing, employment opportunities and basic necessities to those seeking a fresh start.
Many clients are referred by the Department of Corrections, but some visit the office on N. Main Street in White River Junction by their own volition. 
The Center currently has five employees and 40 volunteers from the community, Larry Blake Harvey, the Justice Center’s executive director, said. The organization is primarily funded by the Vermont Department of Corrections through transitional housing and restorative justice grants, in addition to other grants and community donations.

Harvey hopes to increase awareness about the work they do and bring in more volunteers.
“We are in a political and public climate where concerns about safety and crime feel more visible, and there is growing pressure on law enforcement and courts to respond more harshly,” Harvey said in an email.
The Center offers a safer, more effective response to harm, said Harvey.
There are programs to ensure mental wellness, including creative classes and Circles of Support and Accountability, or CoSA — which involve meeting with a support system of volunteers devoted to helping clients work through personal issues and plan for the future.
“The evidence is really clear. When the folks who are reentering society or communities after incarceration do not receive support and services similar to what we offer here, recidivism is a high likelihood,” Harvey said in an interview at the Center.
Of the more than 100 clients the center supports each year, more than 90% find employment and stability, and do not reoffend during program participation, according to the HCRJC website. About half of the Justice Center clients participate in its programs as an alternative to jail time for more minor crimes if completed successfully. 
As a child, Taylor’s home life involved drugs and abuse, he said. He felt stuck in this environment and remained surrounded by people who promoted a similar lifestyle, leading to an addiction to opiates, heroin and crack cocaine as a teenager.
After spending years in the prison system as a result of drug charges, aggravated assault and burglary, Taylor was released in 2024, hoping for stability. When first offered support by the Justice Center days prior to getting out, he thought it was too good to be true. Promises of housing and work had been made to Taylor before, but always seemed to fall apart.

“I’ve dealt with a lot of trauma, and been let down so much in my life,” said Taylor. “I’ve been through the system and the system is so corrupt that I felt like they were selling me hopes and dreams.”
The Center connected Taylor with Larry Lowndes, the former manager at Listen Dining Hall in White River Junction.
After Taylor volunteered at Listen for a summer, Sherise Simpson, Listen’s community meals manager at Listen, hired him, she said in an interview at the Listen Dining Hall Tuesday. As a recovery-friendly workplace, the organization is all about second chances, she said.
When Taylor first started working at Listen, the Human Resources department gave him an opportunity to explain his record based on information online regarding his past crimes. They listened to Taylor’s story, and he said he felt they trusted that his days of using drugs were behind him.
“I just think it’s good to be honest about it and talk about it because I feel like a lot of people don’t talk about it and that’s kind of the problem,” said Taylor. 
After one month as a dining hall food service assistant, Taylor was promoted to senior associate, Simpson said. He also earned two raises this year. She has no concerns about Taylor’s working ability and considers him kind and self driven.
“He cares about the guests; he cares about the food that goes out, about the quality,” said Simpson. “You can’t teach people skills. You can’t teach how to be nice.”
He now lives, with his girlfriend and 4-year-old daughter, in a post-transitional apartment with affordable rent coordinated by the Center, Harvey said. In his free time, Taylor focuses on health and fitness by going to the gym. 
The Justice Center also helped Johnathan Gordon, 45, reintegrate into society when he was released from incarceration in 2018, after serving an 11-year sentence. The Center helped Gordon find a restaurant job in White River Junction less than a week after he got out.

Gordon worked with his CoSA of 12 people over that first year to become more open about his past. He said that he had the biggest group of any client because he asked for extra support. 
“I wasn’t quite open about my offense or anything. They wanted me to be more open about it,” Gordon said in an interview at the Center earlier this month.
When it came to getting through the hiring process for later roles in White River Junction, Gordon decided to be upfront about his sex crime conviction, oftentimes having a conversation with the manager before even applying. 
“It took me a while to figure out how to say it, but I got used to it,” said Gordon.
A criminal record can create difficulty when seeking employment. However, both Taylor and Gordon say they found it effective to let their work ethic speak for itself. 
“I’m the type of employee who will show up 10 minutes before I’m doing the work,” said Gordon.
Gordon has worked at the Britton Lumber Company based in Bath, N.H., for about three months. Reached by phone, product manager John Moses, Gordon’s boss, declined to comment on his work ethic.
After his release from incarceration, in addition to finding work, Gordon began living independently in East Corinth and purchased a vehicle. In 2024, he married his husband, Phil Garland.
As of May 16, Gordon will no longer be on parole, meaning he’ll be completely free and unsupervised after 20 years in the justice system. He is interested in volunteering with the Center and, ultimately, finding a job that involves operating construction vehicles. Harvey said over the phone that Gordon already volunteers on a monthly basis, and is often the first to offer his advice and phone number to new clients.
Gordon advises future clients to ask for help and be open. The most important step is a willingness to change, he said, and the volunteers will help from there.
Kitty O’Hara, a Woodstock resident, is the longest-serving volunteer at the Center, having been involved since 2012. Gordon described her as his “strongest supporter” since the beginning of his time there, even teaching him to drive so he could get a license for the first time.
“We all make mistakes, and that doesn’t mean you can’t change,” said O’Hara. “To just dismiss them like they’re throwaway people, I just think that’s such a big mistake. They really can contribute back to society. They just need a little help.”
O’Hara said that those who complete long prison sentences often have never owned a cellphone before and need assistance setting up a bank account and getting a job. The goal is to help people move on by providing those initial resources as well as mental health support along the way. 
O’Hara teaches art classes at the Center for any interested clients. The creative projects promote mindfulness and connecting with other community members in a low-pressure environment, O’Hara said.
One student, Jonney Reisinger, 58, has a particular interest in art. As a member of the AVA Gallery in Lebanon, Reisinger had his art on display for a member show. 
Reisinger has been with the Center for two years, since completing a six-month sentence. During his first visit, Reisinger wasn’t sure who to trust. Now, he is proud to have created works of art and formed friendships with both volunteers and other clients. He bought a car and works in the warehouse at Upper Valley Produce, and looks forward to seeing what other opportunities come his way. 
“It’s so exciting to see that somebody I work with now is a member of the AVA Gallery (and) is showing some of his work,” said O’Hara. “And I look at John (Gordon), and how he’s progressed. It makes you feel good.”
The Center is seeking more volunteers as it expands programming in 2026. The organization plans to add new housing units, as an average of 140 people in Vermont stay in jail longer than their sentences due to a lack of transitional housing, Harvey said. The Center also wants to increase outreach by teaching community members — particularly youth — how to handle conflict and repair harm.
Harvey calls on community members to join the cause by taking an active role in helping respond to harm. Ways to contribute could include mentoring clients, supporting victims of crimes, practical assistance in transportation, job searches, etc., and teaching a special skill as a class at the Center.
Even as he is starting to move on from his past, Taylor said he wants to keep in touch with the people at the Justice Center because of how much they helped him. His job at Listen also gives him the chance to pay it forward. 
“I really like being here because I can help people that are in the same position as I was. I see a lot of homeless people my age come in and a lot of people who aren’t working, and I’ve helped a lot of people,” said Taylor. “It feels good to give back.”
Those interested in volunteering on a regular or occasional basis are encouraged to fill out the interest form on the HCRJC website.

Language in park’s 75-year-old founding legislation means its staff will have to make recommendations to provide more hunting, though opportunities may be limited. 
The post Trump administration wants to boost hunting in Grand Teton National Park appeared first on WyoFile .","The National Park Service has four months to develop ideas for how to increase elk hunting in Grand Teton National Park following a directive from U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
A Jan. 7 secretarial order requires federal land managers to come up with recommendations for increasing hunting and fishing opportunities on public lands managed by the U.S. Department of Interior. 
Typically, the Park Service doesn’t allow hunting — the agency’s founding legislation, the 1916 Organic Act, generally prohibits it. But there are dozens of parks where Congress made an exception, and Grand Teton National Park is one of them. 
Teton Park spokeswoman Emily Davis referred WyoFile to the agency’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. for questions. The 310,000-acre park is still awaiting specific guidance regarding Burgum’s order, she said.

But the secretarial directive makes it clear that Teton Park has until May 8 to provide recommendations for “expanding opportunities” related to hunting authorized by Congress. Additionally, park staff must review regulations to “identify restrictions on hunting or fishing” that exceed their authorities and then identify “appropriate” modifications. 
In Grand Teton, elk hunting is the only type of hunting authorized by Congress. Language in the park’s enabling legislation calls for a “controlled and managed reduction” of elk by “qualified and experienced hunters” who are considered “deputized rangers.” Partly because of the setting — it takes place near roads and sometimes in view of tourists — the annual park hunt has proven controversial at times, even triggering litigation. 
The Park Service sets hunting seasons and quotas for Grand Teton’s annual fall hunt, dubbed a “reduction program,” in consultation with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

Because the Jackson Elk Herd has hovered slightly below its 11,000-animal objective and long-distance migrating elk pass through Teton Park, hunting there has been scaled back significantly. Although hundreds of licenses were once available for the hunt, tag numbers have fallen to 20 in the park, classified as hunt area 75 by Wyoming. 
Wildlife disease experts predict the Jackson Herd will shrink considerably in the years and decades to come because of the effects of chronic wasting disease. A planning process is underway to alter the historic practice of elk feeding and avert the worst consequences of the always-fatal disease.

Those factors may make it difficult for federal and state wildlife managers to achieve Burgum’s vision and ramp up elk hunting opportunities in Teton Park. 
“The Wyoming Game and Fish Department objective for the Jackson Elk Herd is 11,000, and it’s been below that for the last three years,” Wyoming Wildlife Advocates Executive Director Kristin Combs told WyoFile. “It seems like Game and Fish would not want to increase hunting within Grand Teton National Park.” 
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department declined an interview for this story. 
Grand Teton isn’t the only park that may run into difficulties, National Parks Conservation Association lobbyist Kristen Brengel said. There are nearly 70 Park Service units where hunting is permitted, including the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, where hunting seasons are broader and mirror those set by Game and Fish. But the Congressional language authorizing park-specific hunts is oftentimes quite restrictive, she said. 
“You can’t abandon the Organic Act to hunt,” Brengel said. “That’s why I think this is going to be a fruitless exercise.” 
Brengel also questioned the wisdom of adding duties — in this case, requiring a planning process — for national parks that have been steadily shedding staff. The Park Service has lost a quarter of its staff since the second Trump administration began, she said, and as of October, Grand Teton’s full-time, year-round workforce had dwindled by 20%. 
“If Doug Burgum wants more of something, he should focus on more staff,” Brengel said. “You’re not going to get any of these things that he wants done with the amount of staff he has now at the Park Service.” 
Although Park Service advocates have not met Burgum’s directive favorably, the reception has been warmer in other circles. The order applies to all Interior Department agencies, including those where hunting is more commonplace, such as the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Greg Sheehan, president and CEO of the Mule Deer Foundation, called the directive “one of the most important conservation and access actions taken in decades.” 
“Secretary Burgum is reaffirming that hunting and fishing are not fringe activities on public lands,” Sheehan said in a statement. “They are foundational to how wildlife is conserved, funded, and managed in America.”
In a Congressional hearing Tuesday, Wyoming resident and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Brian Nesvik cited Burgum’s order as an example of the good he believes the Trump administration is doing for public lands. 
“I don’t believe that anybody should be worried about what this administration is doing with public lands,” Nesvik said.

Vermont should prepare for a future with more mysterious objects in the sky, one lawmaker argues.

Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, speaks before the House Government Operations Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, Jan. 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger

He started with an apology.
“If your inbox looks at all like mine since the introduction of this bill, I think I owe you all an apology,” Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, told the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee.
Why had Headrick’s bill — one of more than 600 in play in the House this session — caused such a stir?
Because H.654 is about UFOs. Sorta.
The bill proposes creating a state task force to evaluate reports of unidentified aerospace and underwater objects, assess airspace safety risks and coordinate with federal partners and academics on the topic, with the goal of recommending better policies for the future. The new body would be led by officials from Vermont’s departments of public safety and transportation, with additional membership from lawmakers and relevant experts. 
In short, the legislation concerns UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena, a topic that’s attracted increasing federal attention and lawmaking.
There’s potential for fun in the proposed task force, too. 
“For the cryptids fans in the room, there’s an underwater provision to this as well, so if we want to investigate Champ, we can do that,” Headrick said, nodding to Vermont’s favorite sea monster. (In an interview, Headrick described himself as “agnostic” on the existence of extraterrestrial life.)
“I am not a subject matter expert at all,” Headrick said. “As policymakers, I think we have an obligation to remain attentive to emerging” trends in public safety, he added. 
And he expected military and commercial airline officials would line up to testify on Vermont’s attempt to stay ahead of the atmospheric curve. 
But if skeptics remain unconvinced of the need for his proposed task force, Headrick highlighted a more down-to-earth purpose.
“The proliferation of drone use — this is where I see the need for data,” Headrick told the committee. In the years to come, Vermonters might receive their groceries and packages via drones, as is already happening in other parts of the country. Buzzing propellers in the sky might not cause anyone to think twice as these unmanned aircrafts become normalized, but if they’re not regulated, Headrick suggested, there could be new safety concerns. 
Whether the gov ops committee, which typically examines the inner workings of state and municipal government, has the appetite to exit the stratosphere, time will tell. The body did take testimony from Tucker Anderson, a legislative attorney, to walk through the bill in all its legal detail — the last agenda item in a morning packed with new bills.  
“Appreciate the committee’s patience and tolerance for the last several hours of walkthroughs and overviews,” Anderson told lawmakers. “I always appreciate a close encounter with all of you.”

In the know
“Everything is on the table.”
That’s how Rep. Teddy Waszazak, D-Barre City, framed three bills that would transform the state’s approach to taxing Vermont’s high earners to his colleagues in the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday morning.
“The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer,” Waszazak said. 
Waszazak’s H.619 would create a “surcharge” tax of 3% for those earning over $1 million, while H.621 would create two new top-level tax brackets that raise income tax by 3% and 5% for those making over $500,000 and over $1 million, respectively. He described the two measures as different approaches to the same idea.
H.620 would create a “wealth tax commission” tasked with analyzing the state’s taxation of wealth with a focus on areas that are “escaping taxation.” 
Waszazak pointed to his constituents in Barre City, some of whom he said are struggling to keep up with health care costs and the price of housing. “These are the folks … who we want to invest in as a state,” he said.

On the move
The House passed a bill Friday morning that would create an emergency aid fund for farms and forestry operations affected by natural disasters. Qualifying business owners could apply to recoup up to half of damages they can’t cover another way, up to $150,000. Despite devastating damage from floods and drought in recent years, roughly 70% of farms statewide don’t carry crop insurance.
S.60, which was introduced last year by Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, will return to the Senate for consideration. Several House committees made changes to the Senate’s version of the bill, which included making forestry outfits eligible for the fund, and adding a provision legislators say will streamline the payout process. 
The latest version of the bill doesn’t carry an appropriation, meaning the program won’t run — even if the bill becomes law — unless the Legislature sets aside money for it in the state budget. Some senators’ efforts to write an appropriation into the text of S.60 failed last year.

A fancy new floor plan
What good is the people’s house if people don’t know how to get in, or — if once they do get in — they don’t know where to go? 
That’s the question Sergeant-at-Arms Agatha Kessler posed to the Senate Institutions Committee. She showed the committee renderings Friday of a proposed new Statehouse entryway that a committee of lawmakers have been working to create with an architecture firm since 2023. 
“If you are not a regular here, it’s actually quite intimidating to figure out how to get into the building,” Kessler said. But with a new entryway, she hopes that could change. 
The proposed entrance is set to be on the west side of the building (or to the left if you’re facing it from the front). The curved glass facade would extend from the current building, giving space for a security screening area that funnels to a main lobby with a reception desk. 
The public would only be required to use that entrance during the session, said David Schutz, the state curator, while lawmakers and staff could enter the building through any door with their badge. 
The proposed design could address a need for enhanced security when, as Schutz put it, “important people” are in the building. 
Like everything in government, the project will take time. If everything goes as planned, the new entrance could open its doors for the 2030 session, Kessler said, though the timeline could change if lawmakers don’t want construction going on during the session.

Notable quotable
Vermont’s top economists had a shorter-than-usual timeframe this year to compose their January revenue forecast. Buried in one of their reports, which Tom Kavet and Jeff Carr presented to the Emergency Board on Friday, was the following:
“In an attempt to maximize our analytic time during this compressed schedule, and determine how close our jobs are to being replaced by AI, we explored feeding the economic and revenue facts we determined to be pertinent to various AI models, asking them to draft the text for this report in ‘our style.’”
The result? “Our jobs are safe for now,” the report said, though noted that “it won’t be long before AI could free up at least a day or two of time.”

(Provided by American Prairie)American Prairie’s permit to graze its bison on federal land has been revoked, according to a new decision from Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
The nonprofit conservation group will lose its right to graze bison on seven plots of land in Phillips County. American Prairie has sought to reintroduce bison to parts of Montana, owning more than 500,000 acres in the state. The nonprofit organization has 940 head of bison across 46,000 acres and a mission to create one of the largest nature preserves in the country.
AP has grazed bison using federal leases since 2022. They stand to lose at least 63,000 acres of land they were leasing to graze on. The organization is also concerned about impacts to other livestock owners.
“Our organization and conservation model remain resilient, but that does not negate the fact that this creates uncertainty for all livestock owners who depend on public lands for grazing,” American Prairie CEO Alison Fox said in a press release. “We have followed the law, complied with every requirement, and prioritized transparency at every step.”
Opponents of their bison operation say the Taylor Grazing Act, a bedrock 1934 piece of agricultural legislation, does not allow for conservation grazing, which is essentially grazing that is done for multiple purposes, including ecological benefit. The act does not define what animals can be grazed, only that the Secretary of the Interior can permit “free grazing within such districts of livestock kept for domestic purposes.” 
In fact, the act appears more concerned with impacts to other industries, specifically naming various resources, like stone and clay, that can be used on those grazing lands and also protecting the ability to mine in those areas.
The Interior’s argument in the decision rests on two words that are not defined in the act: “livestock” and “domestic.” Two other federal laws cited in the decision — the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Public Rangeland Improvement Act don’t define the terms either.
“The BLM’s regulations define the term to mean “species of domestic livestock—cattle, sheep, horses, burros, and goats,” the decision said, citing federal code. “But that definition does not answer the question whether livestock can mean anything other than animals managed as part of a production-oriented operation.” 
The decision attempts to answer that question, saying that the term “stock” is tied to commerce and “domestic” is the opposite of “wild.”
“The dictionary definition, therefore, supports the proposition that livestock as used in the TGA and related authorities refers to animals “kept for sale or trade,” id., and that the authority to issue grazing permits and leases is limited to applicants who will use the animals to graze the public lands in that manner,” the decision reads.
American Prairie has insisted that there’s nothing in those laws preventing grazing by conservation herds. Even more, for they’ve said they qualify as a stock owner and that they are engaged in the livestock business. And they have sanctioned bison hunts as well.
“Our bison herd has supported food security, improved rangeland health, and created valuable opportunities for local nonprofits which include veterans associations, youth organizations, and local sportsmen’s chapters,” Fox said in a release. “Those benefits should matter. Instead, we’re seeing a departure from consistent application of the law that puts producers and working lands at risk.”
Burgum assumed control of the case last year, which came after pressure mounted from Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and the four members of the state’s Congressional delegation.
He praised the decision in a press release.
“Today’s decision by BLM is a win for Montana’s ranchers, our agricultural producers, and the rule of law,” Gianforte said in a statement. “For years, we have raised serious concerns about the federal government’s failure to listen to the folks who live and work the land. By proposing to cancel these permits, BLM is finally acknowledging that federal overreach cannot come at the expense of our local communities and the production agriculture that feeds our nation. I’m proud of our administration’s work to achieve this decision and I would like to thank Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and BLM for following the law and putting Montanans first.”
In that letter, the politicians say American Prairie is harming the state economy, which the nonprofit has bristled at, calling the notion “absurd” last year. 
Gianforte painted the decision as a win for farmers and ranchers, though some ranchers have expressed that billionaire ranch owners are a bigger problem than any issues they might have at American Prairie.
“This administration will always stand with our farmers and ranchers against federal overreach,” Gov. Gianforte concluded. “We will continue to protect our way of life and ensure that Montana voices are heard in Washington, D.C.”
American Prairie has 15 days from receiving the decision to file an appeal. 
“American Prairie is reviewing the decision and determining its course of action, and will continue to advocate for a public-lands grazing system that is lawful, predictable, and applied equally,” a press release from the organization said.

With tricorn hats on their heads, the elementary school students attended South Carolina’s inaugural Liberty Day, a hands-on learning experience about the Revolutionary War.
Historical reenactors in more elaborate time-accurate garb dotted the House chamber and wandered the Statehouse lobby, where they explained to the children what life was like when the first shots of the American Revolution were fired in Massachusetts in 1775.

The idea came from the National Society of the Colonial Dames’ state chapter, said Molly Fortune, who leads SC250, a commission dedicated to recognizing the country’s 250th anniversary.
The commission put out applications to schools across the state, and when more applications came back than there was space for students, officials prioritized those with teachers who completed the dames’ 10-week course on Charleston’s colonial-era history, she said.
The goal was to get children out of the classroom and bring history to life for them, Fortune said.
“Kids learn really, really well when it’s hands-on,” Fortune said. “So, when the kids get to shake a rattle, or they get to actually touch the flax and weave with it, it opens a door that is not just history. It’s not just dates.”
One of the commission’s missions is to highlight stories that often go untold, including those of Native Americans, Black soldiers and women during the war.

A representative of the Catawba Nation, the state’s only federally recognized Native American tribe, showed children feathers, rattles and drums tribal members would have used during the Colonial era.
Beaufort-based Gullah Kinfolk Traveling Theater put on a version of Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience, a play about the Gullah Geechee experience during the American Revolution. Spinsters from Belle Sisters, who make period-accurate gowns for battle reenactments, demonstrated how to use a spinning wheel to make yarn.
Those stories can help engage children who don’t often see people like themselves in their history books, Fortune said.
“All these kids here today, if you saw it, it was a melting pot,” Fortune said. “Anybody can be a leader. That’s what I want them to take away from this.”
Names and dates were also important Friday. Fourth grade is when students start learning about American history, and those who visited the Statehouse came prepared. During a trivia contest that could have stumped some of the adults in the room, students knew nearly every answer.
Students divided into two teams representing the Continental Army, moving from colonies in the North and South. With each correct answer, the student troops advanced — using Post-It notes on a map — closer to Philadelphia, home of the Second Continental Congress where the Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776.
Katherine Saunders Pemberton, SC250’s education and outreach manager, called the questions. A few examples:

What female plantation manager, who turned indigo into a major cash crop for South Carolina, supported the Patriots financially and helped Francis Marion escape the British? (Eliza Lucas Pinckney)
Which American general famously betrayed the Patriots and defected to the British? (Benedict Arnold)
What South Carolina fort built of palmetto logs and sand famously defended Charleston from the British Navy? (Fort Moultrie)

The team representing the southern colonies won.
The students impressed Gov. Henry McMaster, a history buff who talked the children through some of the battles fought in South Carolina.
“That was a great thing,” McMaster said afterward of watching the students answer trivia questions. “We’ll do it next year and do it right on, because our history, we’ve got a great story.”
The goal is to make the event annual, Fortune said. The celebration of the nation’s history doesn’t end with a big bash July 4. Instead, events will continue through 2033, the anniversary of the Treaty of Paris that formally ended the war.
Younger children have a lot to look forward to when they get their own turns at Liberty Day, said three students from Latta Elementary School in Dillon County.
History is already fun, said the three students, but seeing it happen in front of them made it even more so.
“This has been the most exciting field trip I’ve ever had,” said fourth grader Alexander Barnhardt.

(Photo by Jeff Fisher/ACEP)For much of the past half-century, nuclear energy in the United States has occupied an uneasy space between a technology of the past and a technology of the future — but not quite one of the present. That is beginning to change, and Alaska is part of that shift. 
A couple of months ago, Project Janus, an initiative led by the Department of the Army, identified Fort Wainwright as one of nine candidate sites for deploying a new generation of small, advanced nuclear reactors. While the announcement received little public attention in Alaska, the program is significant. Janus is designed not only to support the energy security of military installations, but also to move advanced nuclear from isolated pilot projects toward repeatable, “nth-of-a-kind” deployments, where costs are expected to become more predictable and decline over time relative to first-of-a-kind efforts.
This follows on the heels of a June 2025 announcement that Oklo Inc. was selected to move forward on a planned microreactor deployment at Eielson Air Force Base. Taken together with other demonstrations and commercial proposals now moving through testing and licensing, these projects point to a broader shift: new nuclear is no longer hypothetical — it is beginning to move into real-world deployment.
Why nuclear stalled
Nuclear power in the United States generates roughly 20% of the nation’s electricity — about the same share as all renewable sources combined — yet it is often perceived as static and outdated. While wind, solar and battery storage have seen rapid, highly visible innovation and have dominated conversations about the energy future, nuclear has largely been associated with aging plants, long development timelines and high costs.
From time to time, talk of a nuclear renaissance has resurfaced. But for years, that renaissance seemed perpetually just out of reach — always promised, but not delivered. Large projects such as the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia came to symbolize this tension. Built around conventional, large-scale reactor designs developed decades earlier, Vogtle’s long delays and multibillion-dollar cost overruns ultimately hardened public skepticism about whether nuclear still had a role to play in the nation’s future energy supply.
For many observers, the question became not whether nuclear power could work, but whether it still made sense in an energy landscape increasingly shaped by shorter build times and greater flexibility in how capacity is sized and deployed. Wind, solar and natural gas plants can often be built quickly, with far less up-front capital and can be scaled incrementally. Against that backdrop, large, conventional nuclear projects increasingly appeared obsolete.
Reimagining nuclear
This new generation of nuclear technologies is not trying to solve old problems by building better versions of the same systems. Instead, it represents a fundamental rethinking of how nuclear power is designed, built and used. New designs emphasize smaller-scale, standardized systems that can be factory-assembled and rapidly deployed to a site. This shift reflects an effort to adapt nuclear technology to the practical realities of today’s energy landscape.
A major focus of this new wave of nuclear innovation has been safety. Traditional nuclear plants rely on multiple engineered systems, layers of redundancy and highly trained operators to manage risk. By contrast, many advanced reactor designs place greater emphasis on inherent or passive safety: Both the reactor and its fuel are designed to remain stable under extreme conditions.
These more accident-tolerant approaches are being put into practice. A major milestone occurred a few months ago, when the first fuel shipment designed specifically for these advanced reactors arrived at Idaho National Laboratory. The fuel, known as TRISO, is configured differently from conventional nuclear fuel. In TRISO fuel, uranium is encapsulated within multiple ceramic layers designed to withstand extreme heat and physical stress. As a result, a significant portion of the safety function is built directly into the fuel itself. 
This initial production run will support the first advanced reactors to be tested at Idaho National Laboratory in several decades. Commercial demonstrations are expected to follow, with multiple vendors seeking access to the laboratory’s limited testing infrastructure, including Oklo Inc.
What Alaskans are saying
Surveys conducted by Strategies 360 on behalf of the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at UAF over several years show that Alaskans across a broad spectrum of communities and political views consistently favor greater diversification of the state’s energy systems. Respondents support expanding hydroelectric, solar and wind resources while reducing reliance on gas and coal.
Views on nuclear energy remain more mixed, though they are evolving. In the most recent poll, a slim majority of respondents said they would be open to greater use of nuclear energy in Alaska, while the share of those strongly opposed has dropped below 10 percent. Support increases when respondents are provided with additional information: Those who report greater familiarity with nuclear energy tend to be more supportive overall, and among less familiar respondents, interest rises substantially after hearing a brief, neutral description of advanced nuclear technologies. Taken together, these results suggest that many Alaskans are receptive to learning more and engaging on the issue as new information becomes available.
Taking stock: Where are we now?
While progress is encouraging, we still have a way to go before these technologies are available off the shelf. Even the vendors closest to market remain in design, licensing or early demonstration phases. New nuclear technology is no longer purely theoretical, but it is still far from an established technology.
There are also important unresolved questions: how these systems will perform over time; how they will be financed, owned and operated; how regulatory frameworks will adapt; and how issues such as waste management and emergency planning will be addressed. These questions can only be answered through experience — by moving projects from concept to operation and learning from them along the way. And that’s exactly what’s happening.
One reason this moment feels different is the level of sustained federal involvement and investment — an area of rare continuity in U.S. energy policy. Support for advanced nuclear has continued across both the Biden and Trump administrations, enabling momentum in addressing long-standing barriers that have kept these technologies from moving beyond paper studies and early prototypes.
Alaska is already playing an important role. Through defense-led demonstrations, research activities and early commercial proposals, it is reasonable to expect continued discussion and activity in the coming years. Decisions about how far Alaska ultimately leans into a new nuclear era will rest with Alaskans themselves. In the near term, the state clearly has a seat at the table. The question ahead is not whether nuclear can be developed, but when — and under what conditions — Alaskans will decide whether it belongs as part of the state’s future energy mix.
Where to learn more
In that spirit, on Jan. 27–28, the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at the University of Alaska Fairbanks will host a free, online workshop bringing together national experts and Alaskans to explore where nuclear energy actually stands today — technically, regulatory-wise and programmatically. The goal is not to advocate for a particular outcome, but to ensure Alaskans have access to clear, current information as these conversations continue.

(Getty Images) LEXINGTON — A judge on Friday declined to enjoin enforcement of a state law that governs the licensing of alcohol and drug counselors and peer support specialists.
The decision came as a new state law threatens to put many Kentucky peer support specialists out of work.
Fayette Circuit Judge Thomas L. Travis
Two applicants for licenses and a Lexington-based nonprofit filed suit contending that it’s impossible for them to comply with the new law because the state Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors has failed to enact any regulations implementing it. They say the board has let other regulations expire, including those governing disciplinary actions and appeals and the code of ethics that license-holders must promise to follow.
The legislature approved and Gov. Andy Beshear signed the new law — contained in House Bill 505 —  in 2024. It took effect Jan. 1 and changes credentialing standards to work and be paid in many treatment and recovery settings. 
During an afternoon hearing, Fayette Circuit Judge Thomas L. Travis said, “In an ideal world the regulations should have been promulgated long before now. Maybe there’s a reasonable explanation for that. I just don’t know.”
But Travis ruled that the plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the requirements for issuing a temporary injunction, including a showing of irreparable harm.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of peer support specialists Wes Hagenbuch and Adrianna Kenley and Grin Grant Inc., a nonprofit that employs and trains peer support workers. 
Kentucky set to pull funding from peer support for recovery, is asked to reconsider

The defendants are the Kentucky Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors; the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and its secretary, Dr. Steven Stack, and the state Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities.
A state lawyer representing the Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors argued that enjoining enforcement of the board’s statutory framework would preclude the board from issuing any licenses or enacting regulations, thereby delaying the relief the plaintiffs seek.
The lawsuit, which asks the judge to declare the law void, will now proceed on its merits. Travis gave the state agencies until Jan. 30 to file pleadings responding to the suit’s allegations.
Peer support is considered an essential ingredient in recovery. Peer support specialists, who earn $15-$18 an hour in Kentucky, share their first-hand experiences of addiction and hope with those new to recovery. Their duties range from providing transportation to medical appointments and court dates to teaching problem-solving skills.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Three Washington state senators said the biting testimony Pierce County’s sheriff delivered during a committee hearing Thursday was threatening to legislators.
Sheriff Keith Swank delivered the remarks to the Senate Law and Justice Committee, stating his opposition to legislation that would set stricter eligibility requirements for people to serve as sheriffs and in other law enforcement leadership jobs. In his roughly 90 seconds of comments, Swank also remarked on a bill that would restrict officers from wearing masks.
“My deputies don’t wear masks, but once you pass this law that they can’t, I would not only allow them, but I would encourage them to do so just to see what you do,” he said.
“I don’t recognize your authority to impose these controls over me and when you try to remove me from office, thousands of Pierce County residents will surround the County-City Building in downtown Tacoma and will not allow that to happen,” he continued. “I hope it doesn’t come to that, but I, and they, are prepared. Are you prepared?”
The sponsor of the bill on eligibility standards for law enforcement officials, Sen. John Lovick, D-Mill Creek, served as a state trooper and Snohomish County sheriff.

He saw Swank’s comments asking if lawmakers were “prepared” as “very, very threatening.” He compared Swank’s intimidating behavior to Eugene “Bull” Connor, the 20th-century Alabama police leader who opposed civil rights for Black people and was known for ordering the use of fire hoses and police dogs on demonstrators. 
“He just doesn’t represent what law enforcement is supposed to represent,” Lovick said. 
As a sheriff, Lovick said he wanted to set the example for his rank-and-file deputies. 
“I want them to display the same characteristics I have,” Lovick said. “If I go and talk to legislators like that, they might feel compelled to speak to the public that way.”
Law and Justice Committee Chair Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond, said she has a thick skin after being a prosecutor for 20 years. 
“I recognized threats in his speech, but I do not get intimidated by bullies,” she said Friday.
The Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs condemned Swank’s comments as “inflammatory” and said it plans to initiate proceedings to consider expelling him from the organization.
“The scope of his testimony went beyond reasonable dialogue and devolved into what could be perceived as threatening to legislators and he challenged their constitutional authority,” association leadership said in a statement. “The manner in which he conducted himself was not in line with the professional behavior we expect of members.”
The association noted it also has “grave concerns” with the legislation.
Dhingra appreciates the association’s move to potentially expel Swank, but it is “something that should’ve been handled a long time ago,” citing Swank’s history of controversial behavior in office. 
Just this month, Swank clashed with Thurston County Sheriff Derek Sanders in the aftermath of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shooting a woman in her car in Minnesota. 
“PSA: if law enforcement tells you to stop. STOP,” Swank wrote on social media. “You can always sue later if your rights were violated. Even if you are right, do you want to be dead right?”
Sanders believed Swank was mocking the woman’s death, leading to a tense back-and-forth. Swank has also faced backlash for disparaging transgender people and defending those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
A spokesperson for the association of sheriffs and police chiefs declined to comment on whether Swank’s prior controversies played a role in its decision to begin expulsion proceedings.
Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, who serves as vice chair of the Law and Justice Committee, said she felt more directly threatened by Swank’s comments Thursday as she lives in Pierce County. The Tacoma Democrat argued it showed how “off the rails he actually is.”
“I think he’s an embarrassment to the profession,” she said.
There isn’t a timeline for a decision on Swank’s future with the Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, spokesperson Barbara Smith said. 
Eight members of the organization’s 14-member board would be needed to remove Swank from the organization, which wouldn’t affect his position as the elected county sheriff. The influential group advocates on behalf of law enforcement leaders and administers some state-funded programs.
Swank worked for the Seattle Police Department for 33 years before retiring in 2023. He won a tight election to become Pierce County sheriff in November 2024. Pierce County, home to Tacoma, has about 940,000 residents.
Swank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a social media post, he included the testimony he would’ve given if he had more time. In it, he called Democratic lawmakers “evil” and compared them to President Donald Trump. 
“You Democrats hate President Trump so much, yet you do the very things you accuse him of doing such as imposing these types of controls over other independently elected officials,” Swank wrote. 
Swank also wrote that his potential expulsion from the sheriffs and police chiefs association “is what happens when you don’t tow the party line.”
Lovick’s bill would require elected sheriffs to meet the same, new heightened eligibility standards as appointed police chiefs and marshals and would force them to undergo a background check. It also limits the use of volunteers amid concerns of so-called “posses” that rural sheriffs sometimes build. It is set for a vote from the Law and Justice Committee next week.
Swank is the subject of three Criminal Justice Training Commission cases related to his certification as a law enforcement officer, but none appear to have been assigned to an investigator, according to the commission. Under the bill, if he were decertified, he would have to vacate his role as sheriff.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sen.-Manka-Dhingra-State-of-the-State-2026-1-e1768603676110.png,,,2026-01-16 18:57:57.277827

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The American Farm Bureau Federation, along with soybean and specialty crop farm organizations, has asked congressional leadership for economic support to “fill in the gap of remaining losses for both field and specialty crop farmers.” 
The letter follows a December announcement from the Trump administration of a $12 billion one-time package to offset farmer losses across the country.
“These funds could provide a meaningful first step but do not cover the extensive and cumulative losses that farmers have absorbed over the last several years,” the letter said after acknowledging the farmer bridge payment program. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is allocating the funding with commodity specific payment rates and set aside $1 billion of the $12 billion for specialty crop farmers. 
The American Soybean Association, a signee on the recently submitted letter, said in a news release the $30.88 per acre allotted for soybeans from the payment package was not enough to cover the “significant financial damage soybean farmers sustained this year due to the high cost of production and losses sustained during the China trade war.” 
Grant Kimberley, Iowa Soybean Association’s director of market development, said the additional need from farmers is “complicated” and is a result of more than just one event in the past year. 
“I think people don’t really realize this has been going on for a couple years now,” Kimberley said. “… Just about every row crop agriculture sector in the whole country has been losing money, probably, for the last three years.”
Kimberley said the ongoing downturn in the industry is due to several factors, including low commodity prices, high input costs, changes in global trade and uncertainty in domestic markets. 
Data from Farm Bureau show that commodity prices for major row crops like corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat have declined each year since 2022. 
Kimberley said as the prices that farmers can get for their crops has declined, expenses have not declined, and have instead increased.  Land, rent, equipment and inputs like fertilizer, seed and chemicals continue to squeeze farmers’ bottom lines, he said.
Farm Bureau economists found that farm expenses in 2025 were 12% higher than the previous five-year average cost. 
Another piece to the puzzle, Kimberley explained, is the growing soybean and row crop markets in Brazil and other South American countries. He said the expansion of these markets has interrupted U.S. demand, especially with big buyers like China. 
China also declined to purchase U.S. soybeans for the beginning part of harvest season due to President Donald Trump’s trade policies. While the country later agreed to a trade deal, Kimberley said it’s less than what the country previously bought from the U.S. and the gap in purchasing this year has also had an effect. 
Kimberley also pointed to the lack of finalized guidance from federal agencies on renewable fuel standards and tax credits. Many of these initiatives, like 45Z tax credits for low-carbon fuel, were initiated during the Biden administration and still do not have finalized guidelines.
Other standards, like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s blending standards, were proposed over the summer and have yet to be finalized. Kimberley, who is also executive director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, said this uncertainty means overall biodiesel production has declined in the state, causing a “ripple in the pond” for soybean demand.
“You can’t really just say it’s this or that, you know, it’s all of these things that have kind of added up a little bit over time,” Kimberley said.
The letter from American Farm Bureau Federation also noted the compounding factors squeezing farmers. According to the letter, farmer bankruptcies are increasing and nationwide farmer losses are approaching $100 billion. 
“These trends aren’t just statistics; they represent an economic crisis in rural America,” the letter said. 
Specialty crop farmers are also struggling under similar pressures and asked Congress for relief. 
The majority of the more than 50 organizations that signed the letter represented specialty crop growers. 
In a news release about the letter, the Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance said that despite the fact that specialty crops account for more than one-third of all U.S. crop sales, the farmer bridge program from USDA allocated just $1 billion to the industry. 
“Any agricultural aid package should reflect the economic contribution of specialty crops, which support rural communities and provide key nutrition,” the alliance leadership said in the release. 
The letter, addressed to House and Senate leadership, ask for “immediate” congressionally approved support. 
Kimberley said additional changes need to occur in the farm economy for farmers to be profitable, but those changes won’t happen overnight.
“None of these things make farmers whole, and (aid packages) are not preferred, but sometimes they’re necessary,” Kimberley said.

Caitlin Wachsmuth, co-chair of Prairie Abortion Fund’s board, said Friday afternoon the organization was holding off on speaking publicly about the cease-and-desist order until it could seek input from legal counsel.
Abortion is almost entirely illegal in North Dakota. There is no abortion clinic operating in the state.
The mission of Prairie Abortion Fund, which dates back to 1999, is to help women access abortions in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. This includes providing financial assistance with the cost of abortion-related medical care, transportation and birth control, among other expenses, its website states.
In the order, the Attorney General’s Office says the Bureau of Criminal Investigation was able to successfully purchase abortion pills without a prescription from two businesses listed on Prairie Action Fund’s webpage.
The agency says these pills “are not FDA approved” and contain ingredients that must be prescribed by a doctor.
By facilitating access to the pills, Prairie Abortion Fund lends credibility to “counterfeit, unapproved, untested, misbranded or misrepresented products,” the Attorney General’s Office argues in the order.
The order states that the Attorney General’s Crime Laboratory Division conducted some tests on the pills purchased through retailers found through the nonprofit’s website.
The test found “at least some of the tablets contained the represented content mifepristone,” and no controlled substances were detected in the pills.
The laboratory could not test whether the dosage strengths of the pills were the same as advertised by the retailers, according to the order.
The agency notes the North Dakota’s Abortion Control Act requires doctors to be physically present any time the abortion medications mifepristone and misoprostol are administered to a patient.
The order also claims the nonprofit is breaking federal and state laws that prohibit the sale of misbranded drugs.
Prairie Abortion Fund’s website says that it is “intended for informational purposes only” and “does not provide medical or legal advice.”
North Dakota abortion ban deemed constitutional in split opinion from state Supreme Court

“Prairie Abortion Fund is making efforts to comply with applicable law and regulations to the best of its understanding and ability,” the website states.
If Prairie Abortion Fund wishes to challenge the cease-and-desist order, it has 10 days to request an administrative hearing with the attorney general, according to state law.
Violating the order could result in fines of $1,000 per violation. Additionally, North Dakota’s Consumer Fraud Law carries penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.
According to Prairie Action Fund’s website, the nonprofit has served more than 600 callers. Its work has included distributing more than 1,000 Plan B contraception pills, providing at least $104,000 to patients seeking abortion care and $172,000 in birth control assistance. 
Abortion is illegal in North Dakota except in cases of rape or incest if the mother has been pregnant less than six weeks, or when the pregnancy would be considered a serious physical health threat under “reasonable medical judgment.”
The law was upheld late last year after the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled 3-2 that the ban is unconstitutional. A supermajority vote of four of five justices is required to strike down a law.

Jan. 14, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors is officially suing to stop the University of Nebraska Board of Regents from securing sole ownership of the nonprofit using an $800 million deal with Clarkson Regional Health Services.
Nebraska Medicine filed the lawsuit Friday, less than 24 hours after the regents voted unanimously to proceed with the $800 million deal. Regents and NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold had described it as similar to divorce proceedings or selling a house, with sole ownership expected to be transferred by June 30.
Both NU and Clarkson have maintained a 50-50 split of the hospital, clinical and medical nonprofit since 1997.
The transaction, plus a promised donation from Clarkson to NU, is as follows:

$500 million for NU to buy out Clarkson’s 50% share of Nebraska Medicine.
$300 million for NU to purchase related Clarkson-area properties.
$200 million that Clarkson pledges to donate to NU for “Project Health” in Omaha, a $2.19 billion endeavor to build up the next generation of health care.

NU regents unanimously approve $800M Clarkson deal for Nebraska Medicine

In a brief statement Friday, Nebraska Medicine wrote: “This is a necessary but unfortunate step to take, but it is aligned with our commitment to protect the mission of Nebraska Medicine. Out of respect for the judicial process, we will let our complaint explain our serious concerns and requests, and we will not provide further comment.”
An NU spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Gold and NU regents have argued they are following their legal interpretation of the joint agreement, including advice they said came from the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. NU leaders also said they acted quickly, in part, to prevent Clarkson from seeking to sell its share to an out-of-state or for profit entity.
The lawsuit, filed in Douglas County District Court, asks the court to decide whether the regents and Clarkson can “unilaterally” enter into transactions that Nebraska Medicine leaders argue violate a joint agreement between NU and Clarkson and Nebraska Medicine’s governing documents.
Nebraska Medicine leaders have argued Clarkson can withdraw from its ownership stake only if the Nebraska Medicine board and NU sign off.
“Plaintiffs believe this answer is clearly no, and thus, file this lawsuit to stop an imminent, harmful and, in part, unlawful, set of transactions,” the lawsuit reads in part.
Nebraska Medicine leaders had argued the deal was unlawful ever since NU and Clarkson publicly announced the idea Jan. 2 after a year and a half of closed-door negotiations that both entities said were subject to “strict” nondisclosure agreements.
This is a developing story.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine’s top fundraisers in the 2026 race for governor have each amassed more than a million dollars — but in vastly different ways.

Democrat Hannah Pingree and Republican Jonathan Bush have each raised more than $1.3 million, and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, has also received more than a million in contributions. But while the Democratic candidates’ contributions are in part from many Mainers chipping in small amounts, most of Bush’s donors contributed the legal maximum: $2,075.
That’s according to a Maine Morning Star analysis of the latest campaign finance reports published on the Maine Ethics Commission website, detailing fundraising from the second half of 2025.
Former Maine House of Representatives Speaker Pingree has consistently led the race in fundraising since she launched her campaign in June, amassing more than $1.4 million, according to the January 15 report. Her campaign said donations came in from all 16 counties and nearly 300 Maine towns, “reflecting the campaign’s statewide reach and growing support as Hannah continues to meet with workers, families, small business owners, and community leaders across Maine.”
According to Maine Ethics Commission data, Pingree’s campaign reported contributions from more than 1,800 unique donors, including several state representatives and officials, including Attorney General Aaron Frey. That aligns with the endorsements she’s received from more than 100 former and current state leaders. She raised more than $58,000 in small contributions of $50 or less. Pingree also received two donations for the maximum amount from her mother, U.S. Representative Chellie Pingree, as well as contributions from Gov. Janet Mills’ siblings, Dora Mills and Peter Mills.  
Bush, a health care entrepreneur, entered the campaign months after Pingree and Bellows in October, but has assembled the second largest war chest.A significant part of that is the $300,000 loan he gave himself, but Bush’s fundraising stands out for the large number of out-of-state contributions. He also received a high number of contributions for the legal maximum, including a donation from his cousin, former President George W. Bush. Overall, Bush raised close to a million from fewer than 700 unique contributors.
Bush is currently leading the Republican gubernatorial candidates in fundraising, with attorney and Leeds resident Bobby Charles in second place with more than $500,000 raised. Bush’s campaign manager Eamonn Dundon highlighted his fundraising as proof that he can beat Democrats in the general election.
“The rest of the candidates in the Republican field are nice guys with some good ideas, but they’ve shown now that they can’t compete with Democrats’ massive money machine that will be trained at whoever our nominee is in June,” Dundon said in a press release. 
With just over a million dollars in the bank, Bellows’ — who was first to announce her run last March — leads in the most small dollar contributions: more than $146,000 in amounts of $50 or less.
“The Maine Ethics Commission’s end of year reports show what Mainers have already known: Shenna Bellows is the leading candidate for Maine Governor,” her campaign said in a press release.
Democrats Angus King III, a businessman, and former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson follow, with $900,000 and $600,000 raised, respectively. And although former head of Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Nirav Shah only entered the race in October, he has already raised more than $500,000, as has independent Sen. Rick Bennett. Republicans David Jones and Owen McCarthy have raised $400,000 and $300,000 each, although both gave their own campaigns big loans.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/MInnesota Reformer)Two videos add new details to what happened before and after an immigration agent shot a man in the leg in the Hawthorne neighborhood in north Minneapolis Wednesday night.
One video, a livestream of a 911 call from inside the house, includes a woman saying that the immigration agent shot the man, who she said is her husband, as he was entering the house. The livestream also shows at least one child present in the house.
Another video, taken by a north Minneapolis resident from across the street and shared with the Reformer, shows federal agents firing numerous times into the house, breaking a second-floor window.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Reformer on Friday that the agents had fired tear gas, not live rounds.
The incident began on Interstate 94, where federal agents were trying to apprehend a man, federal law enforcement and Minneapolis police said. The man drove toward a house on the 600 block of 24th Avenue North in north Minneapolis, where he wrecked the car outside the house and ran towards the house, federal and local law enforcement said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Thursday that the man who was shot is Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, an undocumented Venezuelan national, and that he “began to resist and violently assault the officer.”
“While Sosa-Celis and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,” the official federal statement said. The statement goes on to say that Sosa-Celis then began striking an officer with a shovel or broom stick.

According to the DHS statement, the officer, fearing for his life and safety, then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life,” after which the three men ran into the house.
Federal immigration agents arrested all three men, the statement said, and Sosa-Celis and the officer who shot him were at the hospital when the statement was published.
The Washington Post interviewed Sosa-Celis’s mother, Alicia Celis, who said her son told her that the man who was pursued by federal agents was actually Sosa-Celis’s friend, one of the three men arrested.
Facebook livestream of 911 call and observer video
According to Celis, Sosa-Celis opened the door to let his friend inside, and as Sosa-Celis went to close the door, an ICE officer shot him in the leg, reported the Post.
A Facebook livestream video, which appears to show the moments after the man was shot from the perspective of his wife and other people inside the house, partly lines up with Sosa-Celis’s account. The video was published by an account by the name of Lachamaka Mendoza and is timestamped to Wednesday 6:51 p.m., the exact time Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said local police started receiving 911 calls about the shooting.
The Reformer has requested records of the 911 calls made after the shooting to further verify the video.
In the video, at least five people, including one small child, are in a house while law enforcement lights flash outside. They speak on the phone in Spanish to what sounds like a 911 operator, saying that someone has been shot in the leg by “guys from ICE.”
“Please help, we have kids,” one person said.
A woman then tells the operator: “It was ICE, they were chasing my husband for like half an hour and they were trying to crash into him. He got to the house and as we were closing the door they shot him.”
Another woman adds: “Tell them that they shot the door.” It is not clear from the video whether she meant that the agents shot through the doorway or at a door.
The 911 call suggests that the agent shot at the man as he was trying to escape into the house, which would contradict the Department of Homeland Security account that the federal immigration agent fired a shot defensively.

A separate video taken by a north Minneapolis resident starts around 7:26 p.m. and shows the vantage from across 24th Avenue North.
In that video, over a dozen agents surround the house. At minute 2:55 in the video, the agents fire what DHS said was tear gas into the house, shattering the second floor window; at least three more shots are heard later.
At around 5 minutes into the video, federal agents enter the house. One observer yells that there are children in the house. Around 16 minutes into the video, a woman who appears to be wearing a pink shirt exits the house — the Facebook livestream video also included a woman with a pink shirt.
“This is something I would have never expected to see in my life,” said the man who took the video and was granted anonymity by the Reformer. “It’s still hard for me to believe that this is actually happening in my city, so close to my home.”
The BCA’s independent investigation
The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state agency that investigates law enforcement shootings, was on the scene Wednesday night along with FBI agents to process evidence.
Also present at the scene were Minnesota State Patrol and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies, which O’Hara said were there to help control the crowd of over 100 protestors and observers who had gathered, as well as Federal Bureau of Prisons officers.
The BCA said in an X post Wednesday night that it is investigating the shooting in an independent investigation.
The shooting comes one week after the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in south Minneapolis touched off a wave of protests. In the immediate aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, the Trump administration said she was attempting to run over the ICE officer and kill him. But bystander footage shows a chaotic scene with the officer to the side of her car when he shoots her as she seemingly tries to flee.
All three men are from Venezuela and came to the U.S. in 2022 and 2023, according to the DHS statement. The statement describes two of the men as criminals, though the only listed offenses for Sosa-Celis are driving without a license and giving a false name to a law enforcement officer.
Minnesota court records show that a 24-year-old Julio Cesar Sosa Celis has been fined for speeding and driving without a license or proof of insurance.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Leaders of the New Mexico House of Representatives gathered Friday at a South Valley health care clinic to tout their agenda for the upcoming session, one they said will make life better and more affordable without overspending amid a possible economic downturn.
The Democrats gave general outlines for how they intend to use legislation and the budget process to increase health care access, protect immigrants and improve public safety all within 30 days. House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) predicted the Legislature’s achievements will offer a stark contrast to the “dysfunction” in Washington, D.C. 
“We will have to make hard choices as we build the state budget, because, unlike the federal government, we have to have a balanced budget every single day,” he said. “So we’ll have to make sure that we put families first and not balance those budgets on their backs, which I can assure you, we will not.”

In addition to passing a roughly $11 billion operating budget, the Legislature will consider legislation regarding medical malpractice and other health care reforms, a ban on local government involvement in immigrant detention, public safety and road repairs.
According to the speakers and a news release the House released Friday afternoon, House Democrats are hoping to attract and retain more doctors; hold gun dealers accountable for straw purchases; protect license plate data from being shared with the federal government; and create an independent commission overseeing the Children, Youth and Families Department, among other proposals. 
“We may not know all that the future holds, but we’re ready to protect our people, regardless of the immigration status, the color of their skin or the languages they speak,” said Rep. Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque). “Because all New Mexicans deserve to feel safe in their communities.”
Advocacy groups push to expand immigrant services, driver protections during session

Much of the news conference focused on the Democrats’ plans for health care amid a statewide doctor shortage that has prompted sharp criticism from Republicans and advocacy groups. 
Martinez and Rep. Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe) described a medical malpractice reform bill that aims to reduce the number of malpractice lawsuits as well as protect doctors from losing their practices if they get sued. 
The bill has not yet been introduced. Rep. Liz Thomson (D-Albuquerque), chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee, told Source New Mexico after the news conference that House lawmakers are still working with the governor’s office on the reforms, which she expects to be wrapped into one piece of legislation. 
Republicans and Senate Democrats are expected to introduce their own legislation on the topic, as well, including measures that will cap the amount of damages that can be paid or raise the standard at which a jury can find health care workers liable for injuries. 
Szczepanski said the bill aims to “make targeted changes to the medical malpractice laws to change the climate that our doctors are practicing in.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7254-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

Condos make up nearly half of the 1,039 short-term rental properties in Stowe, over two-thirds of which are located within the town's six resort complexes.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Jan. 15, 2026.
As the Stowe Selectboard continues to consider a cap on the number of short-term rentals, the town’s major resorts are arguing that they should be exempted from further regulation.
Consideration of a short-term rental cap began last fall, when the planning commission sent a letter to the selectboard recommending such a regulation, but with the exemption of short-term rentals in zoning districts dedicated to the preservation of land owned by resorts like Spruce Peak, Topnotch Resort and von Trapp Family Lodge — properties the planning commission noted were never meant to house year-round Stowe residents.
In a September letter to town manager Charles Safford and shared with the selectboard from assistant manager Will Fricke, condominiums were identified as the predominant housing structure of short-term rentals in Stowe, making up nearly half of the 1,039 rentals that have signed up for the short-term rental registry that went live last May.
Over two-thirds of those condos are located within the six resort complexes: Spruce Peak, Topnotch Resort, Mountainside Resort, Stonybrook, Village Green and Notchbrook, according to Fricke.
Overall, Fricke said, properties in zoning areas designated for skiing and resort operations, which include von Trapp Family Lodge, Spruce Peak and Topnotch, account for 360 short-term rental registrations, which is about one third of total registrations and approximately 60% of units in those zoning areas.
Sam Gaines, president of the Mount Mansfield Company, which manages Spruce Peak, has advocated that short-term rentals at the resort should have been exempted from registry entirely, and they certainly shouldn’t be included in a cap, and if the town wants to install a short-term rental cap, they have little choice but to ensure areas like Spruce Peak are exempt.
“What most people think of when they think of a short-term rental, it’s something that is taking place in a residence, a residential dwelling unit, as opposed to something that’s taking place in a lodging unit, which most people would just consider to be a hotel stay,” Gaines said. “While I’m appreciative of the carve out, I’m not sure that the selectboard has another option.”
AWH Partners, the hospitality group that owns Topnotch Resort, was also eager to ensure its properties were left out. In a letter sent to the selectboard last November, the group wanted to make sure they were exempted alongside timeshares and skiing adjacent complexes like Spruce Peak.
Topnotch is in the midst of constructing new buildings that include 31 new condos, which “are intended to be included in the resort’s hotel inventory when not in use by their owners,” the partnership’s general counsel, Nicholas Mayer, wrote.
“The nature and use of these units has been central to Topnotch Resort’s business plan from the beginning,” Mayer wrote. “Should the Selectboard’s proposed ordinance, as we understand it, not exempt Topnotch Resort from STR limitations, the expansion project will become immediately irretrievably infeasible.”
To avoid this “catastrophe,” Mayer called on the board to exempt them as well.
Selectboard chair Paco Aumand emphasized that discussions of any short-term rental cap are only in the draft stage and still ongoing, but the board is actively looking at determining “which housing units might not develop into long-term housing units if they were further included in an (short-term rental) cap regulation.”
The board will further discuss this potential regulation at a public hearing to be held on Feb. 11 at the Akeley Memorial Building in Stowe.

Splitting rentals
Over half of all condo short-term rentals in Stowe are located at Spruce Peak alone, according to Fricke, and two-thirds of those condos are located at The Lodge at Spruce Peak.
When a visitor to Stowe books a room at The Lodge, the process may not be much different than renting a traditional hotel room. But what they’re really renting is technically a short-term rental.
These rooms aren’t regulated like a short-term rental in a single-family home by the state of Vermont. While stand-alone short rentals have to pay a 3% surcharge tax on their bookings, the Vermont Department of Taxes views rentals within a complex like The Lodge differently, exempting them from the surcharge tax because they’re regulated under the Vermont Department of Health like a traditional hotel.
Fewer than 20% of the condominiums or single-family homes within the Spruce Peak complex but outside of The Lodge are registered as short-term rentals with the town, according to Fricke, and Spruce Peak is far from the only resort or hotel maintaining short-term rentals like traditional hotel rooms, but it is a prime example of the spectrum of short-term rentals operating in nuanced ways in Stowe, both within and adjacent to resort complexes and hotels.
While it’s relatively easy to excise the resorts in zoning areas identified specifically for resort and ski-lodging stays from further regulation, the number of condos being let as short-term rentals while their owners are often elsewhere offers a tougher challenge.
According to Fricke, of the 930 short-term rentals registered without a homestead declaration — meaning the property is maintained as a rental or second home — about 600 are not in either of those zoning areas and are not timeshares.
Condo associations outside of resorts have begun clamoring for their own exemptions. Among the slew of letters protesting any further regulation of short-term rentals from property managers whose livelihood depends on the growth of that market in Stowe, these associations have also written to make their objections heard.
Of the 55 condominium complexes in Stowe, 37 have at least one short-term registered with the town, according to Fricke’s analysis.
A handful of letters sent by owners at the Mountainside Resort, a condo association off Cottage Club Road, make the case that those properties, too, were never intended for year-round residence, were always meant to be rented out while their primary owners were away, would impact the value of real estate throughout the town if not exempted and function similarly to properties being considered for exemption at places like Spruce Peak and Topnotch.
Mark Vandenberg — who is on the board of trustees at Mountainside and owns Sun and Ski Inn, where he operates both traditional hotel rooms and some short-term rentals — reiterated that Mountainside was “never intended for full-time occupancy,” and has operated as a “vacation resort, with a strong emphasis on timeshare until very recently.”
“Furthermore, I’d like to point out that many of our out-of-state owners have owned here for decades — some over 40 years — and paid plenty of property taxes during that period. Is it fair for them to see their unit values crumble as a result of this proposal?” he said.
Charles Stevenson, president of an association representing 32 condo owners adjacent to Stoweflake Resort, also submitted a memo to the selectboard lobbying for exemption from any potential short-term rental cap.
The selectboard still has tools to regulate short-term rentals that have yet to be discussed. An entirely new zoning overlay district could be created to accommodate condo owners concerned about being locked in to simply owning property that could no longer generate income. The question of how a short-term rental designation under a cap regulation could be maintained or transferred in the event of property sale or inheritance is another thorny, open question the selectboard will have to address.
If the selectboard does decide to draw a line on what properties can be rented in the short term, as part of a multi-pronged regulatory effort to make housing in Stowe more accessible to the workers who make Stowe’s hospitality economy run, it’s unlikely that all parties will be pleased.
“I think there’s all types of gray areas, and that’s going to be part of the hard work that the selectboard and planning commission have to do,” Gaines said. “Where do you establish some boundaries that are appropriate, keeping in mind what you’re trying to accomplish.”

(Grant Stringer/States Newsroom)Washington and Oregon will not have to build a drawbridge as part of the project to replace the aging Interstate 5 bridges across the Columbia River, the U.S. Coast Guard decided on Friday.
Instead, the states can go with a less expensive fixed span that provides 116 feet of clearance for vessel traffic on the river below. The savings from this design will be welcome news for the states, which are confronting rising cost estimates for the multibillion-dollar project before construction is even underway.
Coast Guard officials informed elected leaders and transportation officials in the two states Friday. A written decision was expected to follow.
The approval “will eliminate the only stoplight on Interstate 5, put an end to commute interruptions, and save millions in construction costs,” said U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington.
“The vast majority of the maritime community agrees that the new bridge design will not only allow river commerce to continue but also improve safe passage down the river,” added Cantwell, the senior Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which oversees the Coast Guard. 
Cantwell had pressed Admiral Kevin E. Lunday, Commandant of the Coast Guard, for a decision by Jan. 16.
Washington state Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said he was “really excited to see that the Coast Guard listened to the communities. We’re one step closer to getting this bridge replaced.” 
Liias, the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, said this is “a really critical decision point” that allows planners to drill down on what the bridge might look like and the costs.
The existing bridge is in danger of collapse in a major earthquake, and one of its spans is over a century old. Supporters of the project predict fewer crashes, faster commutes and more transit options when the new bridge is done.
A fixed span has always been the official first choice of Washington and Oregon. Project planners argue a movable span would perpetuate the same issues travelers experience with the existing bridge, including delays, freight bottlenecks and crash risks.
While Friday’s announcement answers one major question, others, such as what the bridge will cost, when construction will begin and when traffic will finally drive on it, remain unknown.
Program managers are looking to get federal government sign-off on environmental review and a record of decision so contracts can be negotiated this year. Once rolling, construction is expected to last until at least 2032.
For the past couple years, project planners have said the price tag for replacing the bridge ranges from $5 billion to $7.5 billion, with the likely figure of around $6 billion. And they’ve said constructing a movable span would be $500 million more than a fixed-span.
In September, legislators said they anticipate the total could reach $10 billion because costs have escalated 30% on transportation projects in the Seattle and Portland regions in recent years. 
Project planners have been recalculating the estimate for months. The work involves examining “100 risk factors,” including inflation and tariffs, staff have said.
Joe Cortright, a Portland economist and project critic, said earlier this month that the revised expense could range between $12.2 billion and $17.7 billion based on public records he obtained and shared with reporters. 
Funding is coming from several sources. Each state has committed about $1 billion. Tolls — which will be imposed in both directions on the existing bridge starting in 2027 and managed by Washington — are relied on for a minimum of $1.2 billion. Oregon has a moratorium on any tolls other than the bridge.
Federal grants totaling $2.1 billion were awarded last year under the Biden administration. Planners are pursuing $1 billion from the Federal Transit Administration’s Capital Investment Program. This would help pay for a 1.9-mile extension of light-rail from North Portland to a future station near Evergreen Boulevard in Vancouver, Washington. A decision on that funding isn’t expected until the project is further along.
The question of cost should become clearer in the coming weeks, Liias said.
“We know it will be more than the resources we have,” he said Friday. “We will have to figure out how we phase it.” 
He has previously said work may need to be delayed on some of the nearly 30 separate items — from new bus shelters to off-ramp improvements — in this endeavor.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/i5-bridge-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island and Providence education officials say a loan forgiveness program for educators of color is “no longer in effect,” according to documents both organizations filed Friday in response to a U.S. Department of Justice complaint.
Both defendants want the feds’ complaint dismissed and are demanding a trial by jury.
The case began in September 2025 and identified the Educators of Color Loan Forgiveness Program offered by the Providence Public School District (PPSD) as an example of racial discrimination because, in the suit’s words, it “exclud[ed] white teachers” and afforded benefits on the basis of race.
DOJ sues Providence schools over teacher loan forgiveness program it says excluded white hires

With up to $3.175 million in funding pledged by the Rhode Island Foundation, the program started in 2021 and offered up to $25,000 in student debt relief for new district hires who identified as Asian, Black, Indigenous, Latino, biracial, or multiracial. Applicants would need at least $5,000 in debt to participate.
Now, in separate and mostly similar responses to the DOJ complaint, both defendants say the program is defunct, with the phrase “no longer in effect” repeated a total of more than 30 times across both documents.
“The Plaintiff fails to allege facts sufficient to show that it is entitled to recover any damages from RIDE,” the education department’s response reads. “The Plaintiff’s allegations are moot in whole or in part.” 
It’s still unclear exactly when the program ended. When the lawsuit was filed last September, the DOJ alleged that the program “continues to operate on behalf of applicants accepted.” References to the program had been removed from the district’s website in certain places, although publicly cached copies can still be accessed. 
The program lasted until at least the 2024-2025 academic year, according to PPSD’s response Friday. 
The original federal complaint says that “PPSD accepted applications for the Program for at least four school years: School Year 2021-2022, 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025.”
The Providence school district admitted to “the truth of the allegations” in its response. RIDE maintained it was “without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations” in its own response.
The Justice Department argues the loan forgiveness program violated Title VII by compensating employees differently because of their race. In their formal responses, RIDE and PPSD argue that they acted in good faith.
“RIDE acted reasonably and in good faith and has not violated any established right under the Constitution or laws of the United States or any political subdivision or any act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights,” the response reads.
The two parties diverge a bit, however, when responding paragraph-by-paragraph to the latter portions of the DOJ’s argument, which detail the mechanics of the loan forgiveness process at the Providence school department.
Providence school officials confirm most of the feds’ timeline and schematics for how the program worked, while the education department — which has controlled the Providence school district since 2019 — repeatedly says it lacks the necessary knowledge to confirm the truth of these allegations.
Both defendants confirmed they were investigated by the DOJ prior to the complaint’s filing.
Providence officials said in September that they were taken aback by the complaint, as they had cooperated with the investigation earlier in 2025. At that time, neither RIDE nor the school district had been formally served.
According to the case docket, the state and city school department were not formally served, and therefore compelled to respond, until early December. 
The defendants had a deadline to respond by Dec. 29, but RIDE and PPSD asked for an extension to file their responses, moving the deadline to Jan. 16. RIDE and PPSD filed their responses Friday.
RIDE and PPSD did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
The case, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, is assigned to U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan. No hearing date has been set yet.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)The State Investment Board on Friday approved about $1.3 million in performance bonuses to 12 Retirement and Investment Office staff members.
Two state lawmakers had called on the board to delay the vote, citing unanswered questions about whether the bonuses comply with state law.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the State Investment Board, on Friday urged the bonuses to move forward, noting an assistant attorney general and legal staff within his office said the payments are legal.
Armstrong said that while he has problems with the structure of the bonus pay program, he doesn’t want to abruptly take back money that was promised to the agency.
“In North Dakota, when we make a deal, we honor it,” he said.
The program, established in 2024, is intended to reward Retirement and Investment Office staff when its internally managed funds outperform the market.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, and Rep. Mitch Ostlie, R-Jamestown, in letters to the board this week, said the bonuses were based on the performance of funds mostly managed by outside firms on the Retirement and Investment Office’s behalf. They said this appeared to conflict with the statute’s mandate for the additional pay to only be granted if money directly invested by the state agency surpasses revenue benchmarks.
The law doesn’t specify what qualifies as internally managed funding. Armstrong said that while the language of the statute is “opaque,” testimony on the proposal from the 2023 Legislature indicates that the bill’s authors never intended for the program to award bonuses exclusively based on funds managed by Retirement and Investment Office staff. 
The bonuses were approved almost unanimously. Board member Adam Miller was the only no vote.
Seven of the 12 bonuses exceed $100,000 and the largest is $293,000. 
Lawmakers urge investment board to delay action on bonuses, citing lingering questions

The Retirement and Investment Office still has a hand in overseeing money managed by third-party firms, executive director Jodi Smith said during the meeting.
The incentive pay is awarded if the state’s top four funds outperform the market. Those four funds are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance.
Those funds surpassed benchmarks by $191 million between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025.
State data indicates only a fraction of the four funds was invested by in-house employees during the period of time the bonuses cover, Cleary wrote in his letter.
Smith said during the meeting that even if the agency were to follow Cleary and Ostlie’s narrow interpretation of the statute, the Retirement and Investment Office’s investments still did well enough to merit the bonuses.
“It doesn’t matter how you do the math,” she said. “Our team succeeded.”
Cleary and Ostlie have also raised concerns that the board lacks continuing authority to appropriate the bonus money. The lawmakers have asked for an attorney general’s opinion on the matter.
Armstrong said that the executive branch has already had internal discussions about changing the bonus pay program in the future.
He said that even though one of the goals of the program was to attract and retain Retirement and Investment Office staff, it hasn’t been effective in reducing turnover.
“Since December of 2024 this agency, had turnover in 11 of 32 positions,” he said. “We have to address base pay to be more competitive with other public funds across the country.”

Since 2020, 36 states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery department.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) North Carolina will have $213 million in federal funds to spend this year to improve rural health care, and will be eligible for more money each year over the next four years. 
The money for the new “rural health transformation program” is coming from $50 billion that was included in the OBBBA, the massive federal law passed last year that cut taxes and cut Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for people with low incomes. 
The fund is meant to help ease the impact of the cuts on rural areas, where residents have a harder time accessing care and where health care providers are more likely to rely on Medicaid payments than providers in urban areas. 
Every state received money from the rural health fund. The federal government will review states’ progress to determine future funding. Debra Farrington, deputy secretary for health at the NC Dept. of Health and Human Services, said it will be important to demonstrate early wins by delivering immediate and visible benefits to communities.  
“Year-one successes are vitally important,” she said. It’s also critical to use the first year to build momentum toward achieving long-term goals, she added.
During an online discussion Friday about the rural health transformation program rollout, Farrington said North Carolina plans to spend the money on:

Six locally-governed NC ROOTS hubs to connect medical, mental health, and social supports  
Prevention, chronic disease management, maternal health, and nutrition programs  
Increased access to mental health services, including substance use disorder treatment  
The rural health care workforce  
Rural providers’ transition to to value-based care, where providers are paid based on keeping people healthy and out of the hospital rather than on how many services are provided
Enhanced technology in health care through artificial intelligence and expanded broadband access 

“This is really potentially a generational opportunity to invest in the things that we really need to be investing in for our rural communities,”  said NCDHHS state health director Dr. Larry Greenblatt, “things that will make a difference to the individuals living in those communities to improve their health, but also to recruit and support the workforce.”
The federal government is giving states money with one hand, and taking money away with the other.  
“This funding will improve health care delivery for the more than 3 million North Carolina residents who live in rural communities,” Gov. Josh Stein said. 
But, he warned, the same federal legislation that created the rural health transformation program will cost the state tens of billions of dollars in Medicaid funds over the next 10 years. 
“It is without doubt that these cuts will inevitably hit rural communities hard,” despite the rural funding program, he said. 
Stein said his administration will continue to urge Congress to repeal the Medicaid cuts.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/infant.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

The justices will consider whether the Environmental Protection Agency’s approval of the Roundup weedkiller without a cancer warning should rule out the state court claims.
The Trump administration has weighed in on Bayer’s behalf, reversing the Biden administration’s position and putting it at odds with some supporters of the Make America Healthy Again agenda who oppose giving the company the legal immunity it seeks.
Some studies associate Roundup’s key ingredient, glyphosate, with cancer, although the EPA has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed.
Bayer disputes the cancer claims but has set aside $16 billion to settle cases. At the same time, it has tried to persuade states to pass laws barring the lawsuits. Georgia and North Dakota have done so.
The high court will take up a case from Missouri, in which a jury awarded $1.25 million to a man who developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after spraying Roundup on a community garden in St. Louis.
The Supreme Court in 2022 declined to hear a similar claim from Bayer in a California case that awarded more than $86 million to a married couple.
But Germany-based Bayer, which acquired Roundup maker Monsanto in 2018, contends the Supreme Court should intervene now because lower courts have issued conflicting rulings. In 2024, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Bayer’s favor.
Bayer faces about 181,000 Roundup claims, mostly from residential users. It has stopped using glyphosate in Roundup sold in the U.S. residential lawn and garden market. But glyphosate remains in agricultural products. It’s designed to be used with genetically modified seeds, including corn, soybeans and cotton, that resist the weedkiller’s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less.
Bayer has said it might have to consider pulling glyphosate from U.S. agricultural markets if the lawsuits persist.
“It is time for the U.S. legal system to establish that companies should not be punished under state laws for complying with federal warning label requirements,” Bayer CEO Bill Anderson said in a statement.
Environmental groups said Bayer wants to keep juries out of the lawsuits because it keeps losing in state courts.
“It’s a sad day in America when our highest court agrees to consider depriving thousands of Roundup users suffering from cancer of their day in court,” said Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity.
It’s unclear if the case will be argued in the spring or at the start of the next court term, in October.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016713345414-1024x684.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

Preyer, who joined the board in 2019, was instrumental in founding the North Carolina Collaboratory. He also helped establish the university’s School of Civic Life & Leadership, which was touted by supporters as a model for restoring debate and critical thinking on campus. Faculty critics, however, called the new school a “blatant overreach” by the Board of Trustees and an effort to dictate a more conservative curriculum.

More recently, during his time as board chairman, Preyer was a key figure in helping the university hire former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick as the university’s head football coach. The team went 4-8 in Belichick’s first season.
Preyer’s term was set to end in 2027.
“I’ve never felt better about the University and its leadership, so now is the time for me to get back to my day job,” wrote Preyer in announcing his departure.
Preyer’s day job is serving as president of Raleigh-based Restoration Systems, an environmental permitting company that specializes in wetland and stream mitigation.
On Thursday, Senate President Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) praised Preyer’s impact.
“John’s tenure on the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees was defined by incredible reforms,” said Berger on social media. “I’m thankful for his leadership and vision, especially his role in getting the School of Civic Life & Leadership up and running.”
Now it’s up to the UNC Board of Governors to select a replacement to complete Preyer’s term. The Board of Governors is wholly appointed by the Republican-controlled NC General Assembly, and it has been criticized as overly partisan and lacking in diversity.
Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, said he hoped that partisan politics would not dictate who fills the opening.
“I think the way that the General Assembly has politicized the university system, has politicized the courts, has politicized the Board of Elections – all of this is bad,” said Stein.
Stein called partisan intervention by UNC Boards of Trustees or the Board of Governors “absolutely counterproductive.”
“I think that we would be better served if these were not partisan, but rather they represented the broad representation of the entirety of the state, which includes unaffiliated voters, which includes Democratic voters, which includes Republican voters, not exclusively one party,” said Stein.
There’s no timetable for announcing Preyer’s replacement. UNC-Chapel Hill’s Board of Trustees meets Jan. 21.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Stein_1152026.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

In an order from Judge […]","Michigan Capitol | Susan J. DemasUpdated 5:48 p.m.
The state must not spend a portion of the disputed $645 million in state work project funds slashed by the Michigan House Appropriations Committee late last year despite the State Budget Office authorizing departments and agencies to do so, a Michigan Court of Claims judge ruled Friday.
In an order from Judge Michael Gadola, the court ruled that the Michigan House of Representatives and its key committee allocating state funds would suffer irreparable harm if the Michigan State Budget Office “encumbers, expends or otherwise utilizes those funds designated for work projects that were unencumbered within 15 days before the end of the 2025 fiscal year.”
“This harm outweighs the harm an injunction may cause,” Gadola wrote.
The order came after the court heard oral arguments in the matter on Friday morning. Gadola had indicated earlier on Friday that he would rule on the spending matter later next week, which focused on the State Budget Office’s decision to activate spending codes on the work project dollars slashed previously by the House Appropriations Committee. 
The office did so after Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a formal opinion that the cuts to work projects from the Appropriations committee were unconstitutional, bucked the separation of powers doctrine and violated presentment requirements.
Unconstitutional: Nessel says $645M Michigan House GOP project cuts violated separation of powers

Yet, Gadola moved swiftly to opine on the spending matter while the question of constitutionality as it related to Nessel’s opinion was still being resolved.
“The public interest will be served by the entry of this preliminary injunction order,” Gadola wrote.
He further ordered that the budget office’s agents, officers, and employees were immediately enjoined from encumbering, expending, transferring, or otherwise obligating any of the $645 million in unencumbered funds associated with the specific line-item appropriations disapproved as work projects by the House Appropriations Committee on Dec. 10, 2025.
The order did not, however, apply to any funds that were paid out by the budget office as of Sept. 15, 2025.
Michigan Dems say $645M work project cuts are ‘cruel’; GOP’s Rylee Linting also calls foul

The status quo of the order was to be maintained until the court ruled otherwise, with Gadola noting there were other pending questions in the case.
The drastic work project cuts were made by House Republican appropriations chair Rep. Ann Bollin, and championed by House Speaker Matt Hall, who said the money was an area of concern in their push to wipe what they’ve labeled “waste, fraud and abuse” in the budgeting process.
Several of the cuts slashed community services and other projects that residents have come to rely on. Democrats in the state House and Senate unified to call the cuts cruel, and some Republicans joined their repudiation of Hall and Bollin.
‘Trust cuts both ways’: Nonprofits say Michigan House GOP cuts risk harming vulnerable families

Nessel said earlier this month that the cuts were accomplished through an unconstitutional process, which led the budget office to start spending the money.
Hall filed a lawsuit almost immediately, the merits of which are still pending before Gadola and the Court of Claims.
The speaker ran a victory lap in a statement following Gadola’s order.
“I’ve said all along that we were going to win this easily, because any fair court would rule in the House Republicans’ favor,” Hall said. “While ultimate Lansing insiders and Senate Democrats are desperate to protect their pork spending, House Republicans are fighting for hardworking taxpayers. This ruling has stopped Dana Nessel’s bogus legal opinion in its tracks, forcing the Whitmer administration to stop illegally spending their slush fund dollars.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 21:59:13+00:00,CT Mirror,Lawmakers question DOC leaders after audit flagged shortcomings,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/lawmakers-question-doc-leaders-after-audit-flagged-shortcomings/,Connecticut legislative leaders said they're concerned about findings in a recent audit report showing failures by state prison staff.,"Lawmakers said they’re concerned about findings in a recent audit report showing failures by state prison staff to distribute medications on time, inform individuals who were released about money left in their accounts, and provide proper training for employees. 
An audit report released in July, which reviewed the years 2022 and 2023, found the Connecticut Department of Correction had administered medications to incarcerated individuals late — or, in some cases, not administered them at all. A review of medications given out to 10 people showed delays roughly 10% of the time. 
“This could really put inmates and correction officers in danger for folks not receiving their medication,” Rep. Lucy Dathan, D-New Canaan, said during a forum at the Capitol on Friday.
Dathan is co-chair of the legislature’s Government Oversight Committee, which convened the forum, along with the Judiciary Committee to discuss the audit. Lawmakers at the forum also raised concerns with the functioning of the state’s correctional health care system as a whole. 
Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, who co-chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the legislature has heard for years about problems with medical care for incarcerated men and women. He said he wanted to see data from the department showing improvement. 
“Frankly, I don’t know what else we can do to track that we’re getting better. I don’t see that we’re getting better. And maybe we are. But I would like the data to back that up,” said Stafstrom. 
DOC Commissioner Angel Quiros told lawmakers Friday that the department has struggled to fill positions for nurses and prescribers. That was the case in 2022 and 2023, and it’s still the case, he said. Quiros said the state’s nursing ranks declined during the pandemic and DOC is competing with other health care facilities — like hospitals, which offer better pay — for a limited number of providers.
That may have resulted in there not being enough nurses to distribute medication, Quiros said.
Robert Richardson, chief operating officer for DOC’s health services, said the department changed its policies to allow for a larger window of time when medication could be distributed. He said nurses were coached on the importance of documenting any delays. The electronic health records system now allows for exceptions for “exigent circumstances” that might cause delays in medication distribution, such as a facility lockdown. 
Stafstrom said he wanted to receive a direct report monthly on the doses of medicine delivered and the percentage of compliance, so he could track whether compliance was increasing or decreasing over time. 
Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Bridgeport, said she felt there needed to be a way to prioritize individuals with serious conditions for whom delays in medication could lead to significant health risks. 
“ There could be certain medications, [that] when they’re missed even by an hour, could be critical for a patient,” she said. 
In a press conference in advance of the hearing, advocates called for heightened scrutiny on medical care for inmates, particularly in light of the deaths of Tyler Cole and Ronald Johnson, who died from an overdose of methadone and other prescribed medications while incarcerated at Garner Correctional Institution. 
“We will never know how many deaths in custody actually resulted from misdiagnosis and overdosing clients without adequate professional oversight,” said Barbara Fair, executive director of Stop Solitary CT. “Incarceration was not meant to be a death sentence, and yet countless people have died in just the last five years.”
State auditors are in the process of completing a performance audit with a specific focus on medical care for incarcerated men and women. 
Other findings
According to the audit, DOC continued to hold money that had belonged to individuals who had been released from prison. As of August 2024, there were 7,813 inactive accounts that held a total of about $483,000, according to the report.
Several lawmakers pointed out that the money, which had been held in commissary accounts while the person was incarcerated, could be critical for someone who was newly released from prison.  
“Most of the inmates are going to be released at some point in time, and we want them to be good upright, law-abiding tax paying citizens,” said Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. “In this day and age, any dollars in your pocket are going to be helpful, and there’s just no real reason why someone should not be alerted as they’re walking out the door, ‘Hey, you’ve got $500 coming to you.’” 
The audit also found lapses in training for DOC employees. Auditors said 19 of the 20 employees’ training they reviewed did not meet requirements. Employees must have 16 hours of training per year if they don’t have direct contact with incarcerated individuals, and 40 hours per year if they do work directly with the incarcerated population. 
Quiros said he had raised the requirement for in-person training from 8 to 24 hours and reduced the amount of training on computers at individual facilities. He said training numbers had improved in recent years, but were not at the levels he would like to see. He estimated that at each facility, between 88% and 100% of staff who work directly with the population had completed required training. 
Costly leaves of absence and overtime
A series of extended administrative leaves of absence among DOC employees also drew the attention of lawmakers. Several expressed concerned about the amount of money being paid to employees under investigation for misconduct or awaiting criminal charges.
The report found that, while paid leave is capped at two months, nine employees remained on administrative leave for over a year. In at least one case, it lasted for over three and a half years. 
Together, the department paid these nine employees more than $800,000 during the time they spent on administrative leave beyond the permitted 60 days. 
According to the Department of Correction, most of the employees who are on administrative leave are either under investigation for use of force, under investigation for “undue familiarity” — usually for bringing contraband into a facility — or have been arrested for a felony outside of work. 
The department attributed the lengthy periods of paid leave to delays in investigations. 
Dathan questioned why someone with pending charges could not be brought back and placed on an administrative desk duty rather than being paid while not doing any work. 
Quiros told lawmakers that there were 26 individuals currently on administrative leave, a decrease from 61 in August. He said he had been bringing people back to work who were awaiting trial proceedings for felony charges. In some cases, he said, the delays were caused by lengthy court procedures.
Quiros said that of the people who were on administrative leave, he estimated that about half would return to the department and half would be dismissed, depending on the severity of the charges.
Lawmakers also took issue with overtime pay. According to the audit, DOC spent $96.6 million on overtime hours in 2022 and $103.4 million in 2023. The audit found that a number of employees who were ineligible for overtime were paid a total of $81,500 in those two years. 
State Auditor John Geragosian said understaffing puts both the correction officers and incarcerated men and women at risk, which can lead to more people being injured and receiving workers’ compensation. 
According to Quiros, about 300 people completed training for correction officers at the academy in 2025, and the department was preparing to hire 100 people. But Quiros also noted that during that time, 287 people had left the department for various reasons. He said the department plans to bring on 300 more correction officers, filling between 92% and 93% of the open positions for officers.
But Quiros noted that even with every position filled, there are situations where overtime was necessary. He said the number of people on leave for workers’ compensation has been rising. In December, the department had about 200 people on workers’ compensation leave for more than a month and another 230 out on short-term leave.
“ Just throwing more resources into getting more correctional officers may decrease the amount of overtime. [It] will definitely decrease the facility emergency lockdowns that we have for lack of staff,” said Quiros. “But we’re still going to have the problem that, anytime a correctional officer is off on accrued time, it generates overtime.” 
State Auditor Craig Miner noted that there had been a wave of retirements within state government shortly before the audited time period. He said there was likely a high number of new employees at the department in those years, and that the findings of the audits might be more concerning if they were to continue in the future. 
But lawmakers expressed frustration over what they saw as persistent problems.
Rep. Renee LaMark Muir, D-Deep River, questioned whether the addition of more correction officers would really solve the problems. She said the department had the same number of officers as it had in 2010, despite having closed multiple facilities and decreased the number of people incarcerated. 
“It’s not just simply throwing more staff at the problem, it’s stepping back and fixing the management problems,” said LaMark Muir. LaMark Muir said she wanted to see a staffing analysis done. 
Quiros said he was open to the idea. Currently, he said, the department has nearly 500 vacancies. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, urged Quiros to ask the legislature this year for funding to create a better system. 
“ I need an ask that is visionary. I need an ask that has a vision for a prison system that works for everyone in the prison system,” said Winfield.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Quiros-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

Tom Tiffany is ahead in  the Republican primary field. Tiffany has raised about $2 million, the most of any candidate. The reports cover the period from July 1 to Dec. 31, 2025.
There are about 11 months until the primary, which is scheduled for August 11. 
Crowley leads Democratic field
Crowley, who launched his campaign in September, has raised $800,949, including $789,281 in donations and $11,666 in in-kind contributions. About $138,000 was transferred to his governor’s campaign from his county executive campaign committee account. 
According to his campaign finance report, he spent $187,529 and finished the period with $602,181 cash on hand. Seven contributors gave the maximum $20,000 donation allowed in the governor’s race, including executive of the Milwaukee Bucks Alex Lasry. 
“People across Wisconsin are feeling the financial squeeze, and they want a governor who knows how to get things done,” Crowley said in a statement. He said the support is providing him “the resources to build a serious, statewide operation focused on delivering results for working families.”
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, who launched her campaign in July becoming the first Democratic candidate in the race, raised $618,284 in donations and $2,034 in in-kind contributions. She spent $174,894 and ended the period with $603,075. 
The Democratic Lt. Governors Association pledged in October to invest $2 million in independent expenditures in 2026 to support Rodriguez’s campaign. She listed a $86,000 contribution from the PAC. 
Former Department of Administration Sec. Joel Brennan, the latest candidate to launch a campaign, reported raising $566,212 in donations and $1,610 in in-kind contributions. He spent $13,873 and reported having $552,339 on hand at the end of the period. 
Former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes raised $555,647 since launching his campaign on Dec. 2 from 3,790 donations. He spent $88,265 and ended the period with $471,471. Shortly after launching his campaign, Barnes said his fundraising goal is $50 million over the course of his campaign.
According to his campaign finance report, he received donations of the maximum $20,000 from megadonors George and Alexander Soros. 
Former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes reported raising $465,403 and $13,681 in in-kind donations. She spent $63,059 and ended the period with $402,344 on hand. 
State Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), a Democratic socialist, raised $368,685 in donations and $1,188 from in-kind contributions, though she also spent a majority of the funds during the period. According to her report, Hong spent $234,782 during the period and ended it with $134,588 on hand.
Hong’s fundraising came from over 7,300 donors. According to her campaign, the average donation was $49.96 and about 75% of the total dollars raised came from donors in Wisconsin.
State Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) raised $355,455 in donations and $23,132 from in-kind contributions during the period. According to her report, she spent $84,930 and reported having $334,032 on hand.
Roys reported four donations of the maximum $20,000, including from her husband and Peter Gunder, a former executive at American Family Insurance, and his wife. 
In a statement, Roys’ campaign said that about 82% of the donations to her campaign came from Wisconsin residents and that she isn’t accepting corporate donations. 
“Kelda’s campaign is funded by grassroots donors from every corner of the state. With our disciplined financial management and a committed Wisconsin donor base that is growing every day, Kelda will have the resources necessary to win the primary on August 11,” Roys’ campaign manager Jasper Bernstein said in a statement. 
Tiffany leads Schoemann in fundraising
Tiffany, who launched his campaign in September, led the field of GOP candidates, reported over $2 million raised — raising the most of any candidate in the Democratic or Republican field. The Republican primary field is much smaller than the Democratic field with only two candidates.
According to his campaign finance report, Tiffany raised $2,122,489 in donations and also received $3,808 in in-kind contributions. He spent $438,160 and ended the period with $1,695,038 on-hand. 
Tiffany also received $20,000 each from Republican megadonors Diane Hendricks, Dick Uihlein and Liz Uihlein. 
The largest donation Tiffany reported was $86,000 from the Wisconsin Federation of College Republicans. Wisconsin state law allows for unlimited donations from political parties to candidates.The College Republicans, who boasted raising over $1 million, had received $500,000 from the Uihleins.
Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, who launched his campaign in early May, reported raising nearly $1 million over the course of the year.
During the reporting period from July to December, he brought in $535,650 in donations and $3,649 in in-kind donations. He spent $381,394 during the period and ended it with $492,495 in-hand.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderLegislators, religious leaders and community members gathered at Georgia’s state Capitol in Atlanta Friday to commemorate civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. the day after what would have been his 97th birthday. 
The ceremony, held amid a nationwide backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and growing calls for increased affordability, highlighted King’s efforts to fight for racial equality and economic justice.
In this year’s keynote address, John Hope Bryant, the founder, CEO and chair of Operation HOPE, highlighted King’s efforts to expand economic empowerment, calling him the “embodiment” of what it means to have financial freedom.

King’s family was able to send him to the historically Black Morehouse College in Atlanta when he was 15 years old in the 1940s. He would go on to earn advanced degrees.  
“That took economic freedom. That took the ability to have a voice,” Bryant said. 
Bryant also called on lawmakers, advocates and everyday Georgians to work toward improving financial literacy, calling it “the civil rights issue of this generation.”
“What good is it to get the lunch counter access if you can’t pay the bill for the burger?” he said.
The ceremony was also attended by some of King’s surviving family members, the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus and other elected officials.
Government facilities across the state will be closed Monday in observance of King’s birthday, celebrated every third Monday in January. In 1968, King was slain at the age of 39 after becoming the face of the nonviolent Civil Rights Movement fighting the systemic racism Black people endured across the deep South and other parts of America.
But this year, the celebration for some might look slightly different: visitors to national parks across the nation will no longer be granted free access on Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday after the U.S. Department of the Interior removed the holiday from the calendar of fee-free days. Free access to national parks was also revoked on Juneteenth, a holiday that commemorates the official end of slavery in America.
Trump has also recently made comments to the New York Times criticizing the Civil Rights Movement, claiming that it led to white people being “very badly treated.”
But in Georgia, where King was born and lived for much of his life, representatives from both sides of the aisle were united in commemorating his birthday. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp celebrated King’s advocacy and legacy of nonviolence in his remarks to the crowd Friday.
“It goes without saying that one of the towering figures of America’s rich history is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,” Kemp said. “He did as much — if not more than anyone — to ensure we work toward fulfilling those founding principles that inspired the very birth of the United States: liberty, truth and justice for all.”
Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat and chair of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, spoke at a ceremony celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat and chair of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, urged attendees to continue fighting for King’s message of equality.
“Dr. King envisioned a world where children of all backgrounds could join hands as equals, and that vision is not a relic of the past,” Merritt said. “It is a living challenge to each of us every day.”
MLK Day celebrations across metro Atlanta will continue throughout the weekend, with a commemorative service at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King once served as a pastor, as well as a parade, a 5K race, and numerous community service events.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Leaders of the two federally-recognized tribes in Colorado spoke to the Legislature on Friday morning about the relationship between state and tribal governments, as well as a desire to further confer on policy proposals at the Capitol.
“In many places, state and tribal relations remain strained. But here in Colorado, we have chosen a different path,” said Southern Ute Indian Tribe Chairman Melvin Baker. “It is one rooted in collaboration, consultation and trust.”
Leaders of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe address the Legislature at the beginning of the session every year about their priorities, successes and challenges. The Southern Ute Reservation and Ute Mountain Ute reservations sit next to each other in the southwest corner of the state and have about 3,600 enrolled members combined.

Ute Mountain Tribe Councilmember Marilynn House said that she would like for tribes to formally meet with legislators more often. Tribal consultation is usually honored, she said, but is not always consistent.
“Open communication is what all tribes in this country should have and be entitled to, as the government has broken many promises and treaties,” she said. “A way to move forward from the past would be to always consult the tribes.”
House highlighted recently-passed legislation related to tribes, such as last year’s Colorado Voting Rights Act, which enables members to use their tribal identification cards for voter registration and requires drop boxes on reservation land if the tribe requests one.
“This allowed more access to voting for our tribal membership and provided the tribe with an opportunity to be involved in their state’s elections and have proper representation,” she said.
She also praised a law passed last year that gives tribal members free access to state parks. That law is the center of a lawsuit from the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation in Utah, which alleges they also have longstanding rights to hunt, fish and access the lands now considered state parks in Colorado.
Baker used a portion of his speech to call on the state to help more with cleanup efforts from a major gasoline spill on the reservation over a year ago. An estimated 97,000 gallons of gasoline spilled from a ruptured pipeline owned by Texas-based Enterprise Products in December 2024. It is the largest spill in the state since 2016.
“This presence of gasoline contamination in the groundwater raises serious concerns for public health, environmental safety and long-term impacts to the Animas River, our wildlife, our reservation, our cultural resources and those who live downstream,” he said.
He said the spill is a reminder of the risk posed by aging infrastructure and weak oversight, and the state has not allocated “appropriate” resources to the cleanup, he said. Late last year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would work with the tribe and the state to implement a corrective action plan.
“We believe that if a similar spill occurred on the Front Range, the response would be immediate and direct,” he said.
Baker also said the tribe has entered into mediation with the state over the tribe’s ability to launch an online sportsbook without being subject to a 10% tax, which the tribe said is not allowed under the state’s gaming compact with the tribes. Colorado voters legalized sports betting in 2019. The tribe sued the state over the issue in 2024 — the Ute Mountain Ute tribe joined the lawsuit later — but a federal judge ruled that the state is immune to the lawsuit late last year.
“Our relationship depends on cooperation,” he said. “We need to enter into agreements with the state and trust that they will be respected.”

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) The Iowa Board of Medicine has issued an emergency order suspending the license of a Des Moines surgeon accused of posing an immediate danger to the public.
In recent years, the surgeon, Dr. Qasim L. Chaudhry, has faced three lawsuits alleging negligence and medical malpractice. State records indicate the suspension of Chaudhry’s license stems from two separate board investigations that were launched in 2023 and 2024.
In public filings, the board alleges it has received complaints related to Chaudhry’s practice of medicine and concluded that he has failed to meet the required standard of care “in multiple patients and that failure led to significant harm” to patients.

Chaudhry, the board says, “poses an immediate danger to the public,” adding that it the board finds it is necessary to immediately suspend Chaudhry’s medical license through an emergency adjudicative order.
The suspension is “necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare until this case is resolved due the severity of the potential consequences of (Chaudhry) practicing medicine in a surgical or clinical setting,” the board stated, adding the imposition of any other “interim safeguards would not be sufficient to protect the public.”
Chaudhry is charged with professional incompetence and with knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in the practice of medicine.
The board has not publicly disclosed the alleged conduct that has given rise to the allegations and charges but has stated that Chaudhry is a “surgeon who practiced in the Des Moines area at all times relevant” to the emergency order.
A disciplinary hearing in the case is scheduled for Feb. 5 and 6, 2026.
Chaudhry has been an Iowa-licensed physician since June 2010. His practice specialty, according to board records, is transplant surgery.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Chaudhry for comment.
Three medical malpractice lawsuits
The board’s comes order comes four weeks after a medical malpractice and wrongful death case against Chaudhry and Iowa Methodist Medical Center was dropped by the plaintiffs after an out-of-court settlement was reached.
In that case, the estate of the late Donna Burton of Des Moines alleged Chaudhry performed a hernia repair on Burton on Nov. 23, 2020. Six days later, Burton allegedly went to the Iowa Methodist Medical Center emergency room to report that she was in pain, had not had a bowel movement since the operation, and was vomiting two or three times per day. She was allegedly admitted to the hospital and was found in her room the next morning, vomiting and gasping for air. She died minutes later, the lawsuit alleged, due to a bowel obstruction.
Prior to the settlement in the case, Chaudhry and the other defendants denied any wrongdoing.
In February 2025, Chaudhry and Iowa Methodist Medical Center were sued for negligence by Jasmine Hart, a 37-year-old woman who underwent a kidney transplant on Feb. 23, 2023. In her lawsuit, Hart alleged Chaudhry observed in his surgical notes that the donor’s kidney was “oozy,” and that after the surgery was completed, Iowa Methodist received a call from the Iowa Donor Network indicating the donor had tested positive for cancer.
The lawsuit claimed Chaudhry then determined the transplanted organ needed to be removed. After that operation was completed, Hart resumed dialysis and underwent regular cancer screenings as a result of her exposure to the cancerous donor organ, the lawsuit alleged.
In December 2023, Hart was allegedly diagnosed with kidney cancer. The cancerous kidney was removed, but Hart continued to suffer from nerve damage and pain as a result of the operations, the lawsuit claimed.
Chaudhry and the other defendants in the case denied any wrongdoing. The lawsuit was dropped by Hart in August 2025, with no reference to any out-of-court settlement that may have been reached.
In May 2025, Chaudhry and Iowa Methodist Medical Center were the focus of a third lawsuit alleging medical malpractice. In that case, the estate of the late Faye Jean Robinson of Waterloo alleged that in May 2023, Chaudhry performed surgery on Robinson to repair a hernia and to remove her kidney and spleen.
After the operation was complete, Chaudhry allegedly left the hospital and Robinson twice went into cardiac arrest and was placed on a ventilator. The lawsuit alleges that a second surgery was planned to repair suspected internal bleeding, but before it took place, Robinson went into cardiac arrest three more times, became “visibly swollen with blood coming from the orifices protruding from her body,” and then died.
Chaudhry and the other defendants in the case have denied any wrongdoing. A trial-setting conference in the case is scheduled for Jan. 29, 2026.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)A committee of South Dakota lawmakers deadlocked on Friday in Pierre on a bill that would remove an economic development fund from the governor’s exclusive control.
A motion to approve the measure tied on a 4-4 vote with one senator excused due to illness, leaving the bill to potentially be considered again later.
The bill would change how money is awarded from the Future Fund, which receives money from a fee paid by employers. The bill would require any Future Fund award to be approved by a majority vote of the governor-appointed Board of Economic Development, rather than by the governor alone, which is already a requirement of many other funds administered by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 
The bill would also require the office to write rules outlining an application process, methods of assessing economic impact, selection criteria, requirements to qualify for a grant, and the process for disbursing awards.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Bill sponsor Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, told the committee the measure is not meant to eliminate the fund, but to add minimum safeguards and transparency. The only specific legal restraint on the fund currently is a state law that says it must be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state.” 
“Under current law, millions of dollars can be committed without mandatory board approval, without a standardized application process, without objective economic impact criteria, and without consistent public reporting,” Howard said. “This is not conservative governance. It’s simply an oversight failure.”
“And we have seen the consequences through the years,” she added. 
The Future Fund has drawn controversy in recent years over former Gov. Kristi Noem’s uses of it, including funding for a shooting range that lawmakers declined to fund, a rodeo where Noem rode in on horseback with the American flag and a workforce development advertising campaign that featured Noem as the star.
Opponents prefer governor’s new executive order
Opponents of the bill included Gov. Larry Rhoden’s economic development commissioner, Bill Even, along with multiple economic development and business organizations. They said the bill would slow South Dakota’s ability to compete for projects by adding bureaucracy and reducing flexibility. 
Even pointed to Rhoden’s recent executive order, signed Thursday, as a better approach, saying it adds transparency while keeping the governor as the decision-maker so the state can “move at the speed of business.” 
Governor pledges transparency in funding decisions that lawmakers might vote to take away

Rhoden’s executive order lays out procedures for how Future Fund awards are handled and requires public posting of awards and agreements, while still preserving the governor’s sole authority over the fund.  
When asked during a Thursday press conference if he’s pushing back against allegations that he and his predecessor improperly used the fund, Rhoden said that’s not the case.
“I think it’s just to put in writing and give the legislators a comfort level that this is what we’re looking at when we’re making these decisions on Future Fund projects,” Rhoden said.
Howard and other supporters of her bill countered that executive orders can be changed or rescinded by future administrations.
The tie vote was on a motion in the Senate State Affairs Committee to send the bill to the full Senate. Sen. Arch Beal, R-Sioux Falls, was excused due to illness, leaving the panel one vote short of the majority needed to advance the bill.
Among the seven committee members who were present, four Republicans voted in favor of the bill and three voted against it. The committee’s only Democrat, Sen. Liz Larson, of Sioux Falls, voted against the bill.
Broader debate over economic development
Separately on Friday, state senators declined to reconsider a nonbinding resolution from Sen. John Carley, R-Piedmont, asserting that “the free market and the private sector, left alone, will best serve our economic interests” without “enticement from tax credits and subsidies.” The Senate rejected the resolution Thursday, and after Carley had announced his intention to seek reconsideration, no reconsideration motion was made Friday.
Howard’s bill and Carley’s resolution are part of a broader discussion this legislative session about economic development in the state. 
Another bill, from Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, would require former state officials or employees to wait for two years before going to work for any entity that was the beneficiary of a contract the officials or employees approved, awarded or administered, if the contract value was more than $1 million. Existing state law requires a one-year waiting period for all such officials or employees.
Reed’s bill is a response to South Dakota Searchlight reporting about Steve Westra, who was the commissioner of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development during the Noem administration.

Free.,US Education Department delays plan to garnish wages of student borrowers in default,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-delays-plan-garnish-wages-student-borrowers-default,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education, for now, is backtracking on plans to garnish wages and seize tax refunds of student loan borrowers in default, the department announced Friday.Less than a month after the agency said it would begin garnishing wages by sending notices to roughly 1,000 borrowers in default the first full week of January, the department said that the temporary delay would allow it to implement “major student loan repayment reforms” under Republicans’ tax and spending cut bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2025.The delay would “give borrowers more options to repay their loans,” the department said. It was not immediately clear from the announcement how long the pause would last. Education Secretary Linda McMahon signaled earlier this week during the Rhode Island portion of her Returning Education to the States Tour that wage garnishment has been “put on pause for a bit.”  The agency resumed collections for defaulted federal student loans in May after a pause that began during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.A borrower can have their wages garnished as a consequence of defaulting on their loans, and a loanholder can order an employer to withhold up to 15% of their disposable pay to collect defaulted debt without being taken to court, according to Federal Student Aid, an office of the Education Department.The delay also applies to the Treasury Offset Program, which “allows the federal government to collect income tax refunds and certain government benefits (for example, Social Security benefits) from individuals who owe debts to the federal government,” per FSA. Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director for the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, said in a Friday statement that “after months of pressure and countless horror stories from borrowers, the Trump Administration says it has abandoned plans to snatch working people’s hard-earned money directly from their paychecks and tax refunds simply for falling behind on their student loans.” “Amidst the growing affordability crisis, the Administration’s plans would have been economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt,” she added, while pointing to a Jan. 7 letter from Protect Borrowers and other organizations calling on McMahon to “immediately halt its plan to resume garnishment of millions of struggling borrowers’ wages.”",,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

At the year’s first Consensus Revenue Estimating Committee, staff from the House Fiscal Agency, Senate Fiscal Agency and the Michigan Department of Treasury gathered to formalize estimates for economic growth both in Michigan and nationally, as well as state budget forecasts for upcoming fiscal years. 
“My biggest takeaway would be that the economy is stable,” State Treasurer Rachael Eubanks told reporters after the conference. “That’s not to say that there aren’t challenges. There’s a lot of uncertainty at the federal level, but despite that, Michigan has shown resilience and continues to see some growth.”
She added that this growth, fueled in part by revenue performance meeting expectations, allows the state to invest in services and infrastructure now while also planning for the future. 
Looking ahead to the upcoming year’s budget debate, State Budget Director Jen Flood added that, as “the federal government is passing the buck and handing the tab to states across the country,” there have been increased pressures on Michigan’s budget — though she expressed confidence in getting a bipartisan budget done on time. 
Flood noted that while some states have had to pull money from emergency “rainy day” funds amid major changes in federal policy, Michigan has continued to make deposits into its own. 
The consensus forecast that was approved during the conference forecast a 0.2% increase in the state’s combined general fund and school aid fund for FY26, a 1.1% increase in FY27 and a 2.4% increase in FY28.

However, those estimates —especially for the general fund — were much lower than the previous estimates for Fiscal Years 2026 and 2027, by about $780 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, than the last consensus forecast in May 2025. 
House Republican leadership took the chance to criticize spending that they considered to be “waste, fraud and abuse,” a refrain that has become common in the GOP through budget discussions. 
House Appropriations Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) said that she expected the state might have to cut down its budget in the coming year given the lowered revenue predictions. 
“I think that it actually supports our approach to the budget for the current fiscal year, and that we were very prudent, if not preemptive, and what’s ahead for us by taking that budget and going through it line by line and making cuts,” she told reporters after the conference.
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) similarly cited GOP budget priorities — including the controversial cuts to $645 million in departmental work project spending, the constitutionality of which is currently being debated in court — as the correct response to the forecasts given in the conference. 
“Now, with all the COVID money gone and our $9 billion surplus wasted by the Democrat trifecta, we have a more than $1 billion hole in the next budget,” Hall wrote in a press release. “As I predicted, we now have to keep doing what House Republicans did in this last budget. Eliminate more ghost jobs. Stop the Democrat pork spending. And slash even more waste, fraud, and abuse.”
When asked about those statements, Flood declined to directly respond to the framing used by Bollin and Hall, but said that the results of the conference were “largely expected.”
“These are adjustments from the May CREC, which happened before reconciliation. It happened before the tax policy and budget that we passed in September, October, and so we’re not surprised by this,” she said. “The Fiscal Year 26 budget accounts for these changes, and we look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in the legislature to finalize another balanced budget by June of this year.”
However, Michigan Senate Appropriations Chair Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) said Democrats had fought to make responsible investments in the state’s rainy-day fund. 
“As revenue growth flattens, we will remain committed to governing with discipline and maturity, always keeping the needs of the people and the financial health of the state top of mind,” Anthony said in a press release after the conference. “Thanks to smart investments and the extremely accurate forecasting of our state economists, I am confident in our state’s ability to create another fiscally responsible budget that delivers real results for the people of Michigan.” 
The budget analysts also provided more general forecasts for the economy in Michigan and the United States for the next three years. 
Unemployment rates for Michigan were predicted to stay relatively flat, between 5.3% and 5.6% — slightly higher than the national predictions, which sit around 4.8%. 
Those predictions aligned generally with a presentation from researchers at the Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics at the University of Michigan. 
Gabriel Ehrlich, the director of the program, explained that Michigan’s unemployment rate has actually dropped since last April, despite the national rate increasing slightly — even though statewide, the number of employed state residents is falling. 
What that indicates is a declining labor force participation rate, even as the labor market in Michigan remains fairly tight — “the reasons for the decline in the unemployment rate aren’t necessarily the reasons we prefer to see,” Ehrlich said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3701-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

You can read more about the section here.

It has been 25 years since I lived in Jackson, Mississippi, and whenever someone finds out I’m Jewish and from there, their first response is usually, Wait, there are Jews in Mississippi?
I am proud to always answer yes.
Beth Israel Congregation in Jackson, and the loving community that calls it home, shaped me into the person I am today.
My family has been part of that community for decades. My grandfather and father served as temple presidents; my mom grew up in the community and later served as sisterhood president.
I have vivid memories of my grandmother walking up and down the aisles during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, asking people if they had somewhere to go and inviting dozens back to her house to make sure no one observed the holidays alone.
Beth Israel was where my parents were married. It was where my sister and I both became Bat Mitzvahs, where we formed our Jewish identity through religious school and participation in our small but mighty youth group. It was where my husband and I married.

Last Saturday, Beth Israel Congregation was set on fire by someone who hates Jews simply for being Jews. Seeing the charred images of the library is painful. I have vivid memories of being in that library playing hide-and-seek, participating in classes and youth group meetings, getting ready for my wedding  and signing my ketubah in that room.
If I close my eyes, I can see the ark where the Torahs—now reduced to ash—once sat. I can see the books lining the walls that held our community’s history. I remember showing my children the plaques commemorating congregants’ milestones, including several from my own family, which have now been reduced to debris.
Growing up Jewish in Jackson made me a member of two diaspora communities – the Jewish one and the Mississippi one. In the aftermath of the fire, I have received messages from many people who are part of my Mississippi diaspora—some Jewish, mostly not—who have beautiful memories of visiting Beth Israel with me. 
For many of my friends, Beth Israel and my family were the only meaningful encounters with Jews they have ever had, and this fire has affected them in ways they did not expect.
This is not the first time Beth Israel has been targeted. In September 1967, the Ku Klux Klan firebombed the synagogue in retaliation for Rabbi Perry Nussbaum’s support of the Civil Rights movement. I grew up always knowing it was part of my community’s history.
What history books rarely emphasize is how that bombing brought the Jackson faith community together. In its aftermath, white and Black clergy were among the first to condemn the hatred, and members of the Jewish community played a significant role working secretly to help uncover the KKK bombings of the 1960s.
Last week’s fire was not an isolated incident. It is the most recent symptom of the dangerous rise in antisemitism facing Jewish communities across the country and around the world. Since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, the European Jewish Congress reports at least 20 attacks on synagogues across the globe. 
Jews make up less than 2% of the U.S. population, yet we are the targets of roughly 16% of all hate crimes and nearly 70% of religion-based hate crimes, according to the FBI. American Jewish Committee’s State of Antisemitism in America 2024 report found that 56% of American Jews have altered their behavior out of fear of antisemitism, and 1 in 3 has personally experienced it. Each one of these statistics is a person — a mom or dad, a brother, sister or child.

These troubling numbers highlight why antisemitism is not just a Jewish problem to solve. We need people to listen when we explain why antisemitic violence must be confronted clearly, forcefully and without hesitation. Our fear — rooted in generational trauma — of rising hateful rhetoric from all sides of the political spectrum is real and has consequences.  We need allies who refuse to look away and choose to stand up and take action.
That was apparent last May, when I was staffing an American Jewish Community event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., in which Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky were murdered after leaving the event.
The event was devoted to how grassroots diplomacy can transform the Middle East through humanitarian aid and cross-cultural collaboration. Many of the more than 100 people there were not Jewish. But they came together in a time of need, unified in purpose and in hope. 
A few months later, a German journalist asked me how I can stay optimistic despite that horrible night. That wasn’t a question I have ever considered. Growing up Jewish in Mississippi has always meant that optimism is the only option.
Being a part of Beth Israel taught me many things, most importantly that community is an antidote to many of the problems of the world, that Jewish joy is always stronger than hate, and that showing up for people in their time of need is often the holiest thing you can do. Jews in Mississippi – and pretty much anywhere else, for that matter – need that help more than ever.

Meanwhile, attorneys for the State of Montana said the challenge to these laws should be dismissed.
In a court hearing Thursday afternoon in the Lewis and Clark County District Court, Judge Christopher Abbott heard oral arguments about when parents must be notified. EmpowerMT and the ACLU told the judge that two laws are overly broad, unconstitutional, and violate rights to privacy and a quality education. 
The lawsuit centers on Senate Bill 99, passed in 2021. The lawsuit was also updated to include House Bill 471, passed during the 2025 session, which an attorney for the state said was intended to fix issues stemming from SB 99.
It’s unclear, the complaint says, what teachers and school counselors are allowed to say and do in school, what books they are allowed to assign and even what they can do if a child asks a question about gender identity or sexual orientation. 
“As a result of SB 99 and the Defendants’ efforts to marginalize 2S-LGBTQIA+ students, a hostile environment has been created in Montana public schools that threatens 2S-LGBTQIA+ students,” the complaint reads. “The requirement that all teaching or presentations that reference gender related issues and human sexuality first be reviewed by parents along with the related prohibition on teaching these topics in the absence of parental notice, does a serious disservice to all Montana students.”
Legislators tried to pass a bill in 2023 in an attempt to adjust SB 99, with Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, a Billings Republican, saying some schools sent out notices once per year, while others would send them out daily. Attorneys for the ACLU pointed to the broadness of the law in their arguments.
The worry among school counselors as well is whether they could be potentially revealing information a child does not want their parents to know and potentially opening the child up to problems at home if counselors inform the parents they’d like to talk about a topic with their child. By not being able to provide some help to a student, there is concern that it’s also impacting their educational experience.
​​”Even before enactment of HB 471, school counselors report that they are routinely required to choose between violating SB 99 or breaching their ethical obligations, which require them to maintain confidentiality with students,” the complaint reads. “School counselors routinely meet with students to discuss or confer on issues related to gender identity or sexual orientation. Many students do not feel safe sharing that same confidential information with their parents, yet this is what SB 99 requires, regardless of whether students or counselors consent to such disclosures.”
It could also be confusing for teachers who might have a partner the same sex as them — for example: Does mentioning their relationship constitute a violation of the law?
“We’re talking about anything that has to do with a human being, because we’re talking about gender identity and sexual orientation anytime we acknowledge I’m a woman, I’m cisgender woman who’s married to a man, that’s talking about my sexual orientation and gender identity,” Ashlee Rossler, an ACLU Montana attorney, said during during arguments.
Attorneys for the state argued anyone with a state contract is expected to “promote government speech.”
“Any service that a school counselor provides is done in accordance with the contract with the school district,” said George Clark, a state attorney. “That is government speech that they are giving to the student under the guise of advice.”
He added in his rebuttal: “I don’t think a privacy right includes conversations with a government employee.”
Clark also said that he thinks there is a workaround for school counselors.
“The counselor doesn’t have to say, ‘Hey, your kid came to me. He thinks he’s gay. I need to talk to him about this,’” Clark said. “The counselor just has to say, your son approached me. He expressed some concerns. I want to ensure I’m complying with the law. Do you give me permission to discuss with him, you know any topics related to HB 471, under SB 99.”
The short title of HB 471 is “Revise education laws related to human sexuality and identity instruction” and for SB 99, it’s “Establish parameters for K-12 human sexuality education.” 
Montana legislators also tried to push through a bill allowing religious leaders to become school counselors, though that bill from Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton, failed.
“Classrooms and learning spaces are supposed to support expansive and imaginative thinking. They’re not supposed to be limited by the whims of parents and legislators who are injecting their faith-based beliefs into curriculum,” Rossler said. “Especially given that parents do have a role in their child’s education, they have an opportunity every single year to democratically elect their school boards.”
Religious organizations, including the Montana Family Foundation, lobbied in support of HB 471. Clark called injecting religion into the case was “unfair” though a belief among some Christians that being gay is a sin is clearly present in the Montana Legislature and some legislators have used the Bible to justify proposed legislation targeting the state’s LGBTQ community. 
The lawsuit also mentions the inclusion of certain religious values into public education. According to 2024 report by the Public Religion Research Institute, only two major religious groups lack majority support for same-sex marriage, Hispanic Protestants and white evangelical Protestants.
“SB 99’s sponsor, Sen. Cary Smith, explained that the purpose of SB 99 is to reinforce ‘Christian values’ in Montana public education,” the complaint reads.
Clark added there’s due process for teachers and that they have a code of conduct they’re required to follow. Teachers found in violation of the law would have consequences, he added.
“Just like a teacher can be fired for showing a child pornography, a teacher can be fired for disobeying the law,” Clark said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/B86A4213-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

The $5 million proposal would staunch the loss of housing vouchers this year, but is much less than housing authorities had requested.

David Littlefield / Vermont Public
This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
With federal funds dwindling for a key housing assistance program, Vermont lawmakers are looking at using state money to slow the loss of vouchers that help thousands of Vermonters cover rent. 
Legislators have said they want to earmark $5 million in a mid-year spending package to soften the blow of funding reductions to the Section 8 program. The bill has plenty more hurdles to clear, but a key housing panel registered its support for the funds on Thursday after local public housing authorities have spent months crying for help.

Still, the earmark falls far short of the $18 million housing authority leaders had originally bid for last fall, an amount that would have maxed out Vermont’s voucher ceiling set by the feds and boosted the number of vouchers in rotation.
“What we’re trying to do with this one-time, strategic intervention is to…slow the decrease in the number of vouchers in this calendar year as much as possible,” said Rep. Marc Mihaly, D-Calais, who chairs the House General and Housing Committee.
As Vermont faces steep housing costs and persistently high levels of homelessness, federal housing vouchers play a crucial role in sustaining housing for low-income people who can’t afford market-rate rents. Voucher recipients pay a third of their income toward rent; a local agency administering the federal program pays for the rest. The vouchers offer one of the few avenues out of homelessness for the thousands of Vermonters sleeping in shelters, motels and outdoors.
But over the last year, local housing authorities in Vermont have seen reductions in funding from Congress. That has led many of the nine local authorities to stop issuing new vouchers off their lengthy waiting lists, rescind vouchers from people looking for an apartment to use them, and shelve vouchers when tenants have died or moved out. The state lost hundreds of housing vouchers in 2025 through attrition.
Still, many of the nine Vermont housing authorities are entering 2026 in a budget shortfall which they don’t expect to ease anytime soon. Berk is now worried VSHA might need to take the extraordinary step of withdrawing vouchers from people currently using them to help pay their rent if the state does not intervene.
Draft bills in Congress would result in the loss of roughly 300 to 600 more vouchers in Vermont – or $3.6 million to $7.2 million – according to Berk.
“Preserving housing assistance and keeping Vermont families stably housed has to be a priority,” Berk told lawmakers Thursday.
The federal government bases future years’ Section 8 voucher funding on past years’ spending by local housing authorities. That means that as Vermont authorities shrink their voucher rolls, they can expect to receive less money in the future even if need remains great, leading to what Berk has called a “downward spiral” in the number of vouchers available to Vermont renters.
The $5 million in state aid is meant to halt that spiral, at least for a year: It would allow Vermont housing authorities to slow down the erosion in the number of vouchers available to Vermont renters and ensure the state gets more federal money in the coming years. 
“It means that we will always get a greater share of whatever [Congress chooses] to give us [in] future years,” Mihaly said.
Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, chair of the powerful budget-writing panel in the House, said Friday morning that her committee is looking at the funding ask “very seriously.”
“If the Section 8 voucher goes away, these people will not be able to afford to pay full market value, and if they can’t pay, then they don’t have a place to live,” Scheu said.
The stopgap funding would help local housing authorities offset funding shortfalls and prevent the displacement of families, according to Berk.
The earlier public housing authorities can receive the funding, the more vouchers they can save this calendar year, Mihaly said – hence, lawmakers’ attempt to earmark the funds as part of the mid-year spending bill typically passed in March.
But Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s administration has signaled it wants to hold off and consider the ask as part of the budget for fiscal year 2027, which begins in July.
“[The governor] believes that in the face of federal uncertainty, we should not be appropriating funds without first understanding the full budget picture and weighing all priorities before making those decisions,” said Amanda Wheeler, Scott’s press secretary.
The House Committee on Appropriations is expected to hash out its version of the mid-year spending package over the coming weeks, before the bill is sent to the House floor and then to the Senate.

Lola’s Fine Sauces of West Des Moines is suing EcoIdeas Innovation Inc. of Canada, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, alleging it has incurred $700,000 in damages due to Ecoldeas’ breach of contract.
In court filings, Lola’s says that for the past 10 years, it has produced a variety of hot sauces and salsas using fresh and unique ingredients. In the process, the company says, it has grown from a farmer’s market stand to a large company that sells its products throughout the nation at retailers such as Target, Walmart and other grocery stores and supermarkets.

In 2023, Lola’s alleges, it attempted to address growing demand for its product by entering into a contract with EcoIdeas to manufacture “mini bottles” of certain Lola’s sauces for distribution to retailers. EcoIdeas allegedly promised it had the ability to meet Lola’s need for more than 1 million units that met stringent production standards.
Lola’s alleges that in 2024, EcoIdeas breached the contract by failing to prepare labels and products in the manner required. As a result, the lawsuit claims, Walmart was forced to remove defective products from shelves, and Lola’s incurred nearly $155,000 in expenses.
In addition, the lawsuit alleges, there were “issues with defective goods and raw materials that were unusable” due to a failure to follow protocols, resulting in an additional $20,000 in losses.
In 2025, issues allegedly arose with Lola’s Mango Scotch Bonnet products. “Several calls, emails, messages, YouTube videos, and complaints came flooding into Lola’s due to a manufacturing issue in which bottles were bubbling, exploding and fermenting,” the lawsuit claims. “Sauce in several of the bottles also was discolored, and the taste was not in line with Lola’s standards.”
Over the years, some brands of hot sauce are known to have had issues with bottles exploding on shelves due to a buildup of gas caused by fermentation in improperly processed sauces.
In the lawsuit, Lola’s states that it “appears that EcoIdeas failed to fill the bottles at correct temperatures and/or utilize a correct bottle-fill process.” Although those issues did not present any food-safety or health risks, the lawsuit alleges, they significantly affected taste and customer satisfaction.
In total, Lola’s alleges it has suffered reputational harm, plus $700,000 in out-of-pocket costs and product-disposal and shipping fees, and has struggled with retailer chargebacks and lost inventory.
According to the lawsuit, EcoIdeas has acknowledged its breach of contract and promised to take remedial action, such as filing an insurance claim and reimbursing Lola’s for losses, but has failed to follow through.
“EcoIdeas is now claiming it has no insurance coverage,” the lawsuit alleges, and it “has not reimbursed Lola’s for any costs.”
EcoIdeas has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was filed in Polk County District Court before being transferred this week to U.S. District Court. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach company officials or their Iowa attorneys on Thursday.

Tuesday’s filing originates from a 2020 complaint entered during President Trump’s first term when he signed a 2017 tax bill that required two oil and gas lease sales for the area.  Characterized then as a leasing program that “flagrantly breaks the law,” Trustees for Alaska, the firm representing the coalition, temporarily paused litigation to re-draft a plan with Biden-era agencies. That resulted in fewer acres to lease in the refuge and called for a sale to be held in January 2025 which drew zero bids.   
In October, the Trump administration re-adopted the initial program and suggested that another auction would happen as soon as this winter.  Meanwhile, seven oil and gas leases, canceled under Biden, were reinstated to the only entity that currently owns leases — the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, the agency that promotes economic development in the state.
The amended lawsuit, in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, now seeks to vacate those leases. 
“AIDEA’s leases were issued unlawfully on a number of grounds, as the Biden Administration acknowledged when cancelling them,” wrote Bridget Psarianos, a senior staff attorney with Trustees for Alaska.  
“The Biden Administration cited violations of the Tax Act as the primary reason for cancelling the leases, the very law that allowed the Leasing Program to be established in the Refuge,” she said in an email Thursday. 
In response to the litigation, AIDEA fired back with a prepared statement on Thursday.  
“Federal law says the Secretary of Interior ‘shall,’ which means ‘must,’ “establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain” read the statement.  
“The Department of Interior simply does not have the ability or authority to refuse to develop the Coastal Plain.”
The groups joining the Gwich’in Steering Committee’s lawsuit  include a roster of environmental organizations based in Alaska, nationally and in Canada. The Alaska Wilderness League, the Sierra Club, and the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society-Yukon are each named as plaintiffs. 
Together, they are suing the Interior Department and its secretary, Doug Burgum, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The lawsuit names seven other intervenor defendants, including the State of Alaska, the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, AIDEA and the American Petroleum Corporation, to name a few. 
The debate of whether to drill in the Arctic Refuge has been mired in heated political and legal battles for nearly fifty years. The Gwich’in and Inupiat have long locked horns over the coastal plain. 
Gwich’in beliefs center on a profound, spiritual connection with the Porcupine Caribou Herd that uses the coastal plain, viewing them not just as food, but as integral to Gwich’in identity, culture and survival. 
“The Gwich’in have been fighting–and succeeding–for decades in protecting the calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou Herd,” said Kristen Moreland, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee in a press release, Tuesday. 
Pro-oil Inupiats, meanwhile, see drilling in the refuge as their sovereign right.  Under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, commonly referred to as ANCSA, which ceded Native land to the state and organized more than 200 tribes as for-profit corporations, part of the idea was that capitalism through natural resource development would create quality-of-life improvements for impoverished villages.
The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, which co-owns rights to parts of the greater Prudhoe Bay oilfield, is ANCSA’s most shining example.  In 2024, ASRC earned $5.5 billion in gross revenue, a financial windfall enjoyed by its eight affiliated Alaska Native villages — Kaktovik among them.
“In this modern time, we need the ability to be able to provide jobs and resources for our families,” said Charles Lampe, president of the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation. 
The tribal leader and whaling captain said he took issue with Gwich’in interference in Inupiat economic affairs, backed by well-funded nonprofits, and especially by those from outside. He pointed out that Kaktovik is the only settlement situated within the coastal plain. 
“It’s unfortunate the way that our two Indigenous tribes have been pitted against each other,” Lampe said. “And the way they’re using that animal — the caribou — as a reason to push back on our Inupiat people, our Inupiat right to be able to provide an economic future for our community.” 
The Gwich’in Steering Committee did not immediately respond to questions addressing that criticism. 
As temperatures in the Arctic continue to warm far faster than the rest of the planet, the Trump administration has been working to commodify Alaska’s natural resources, opening up previously protected waters to oil and gas drilling, and allowing for other contentious projects, such as the 211-mile-long Ambler road to cut through the fragile foothills of the Brooks Range.  
Among these plans is also the repeated promise to ramp up Arctic drilling.  But oil companies have shown little interest in the last two lease sales. As of now, there has been no public notice for another lease sale. 
For AIDEA’s part, the company was seeking professional support to carry out three-dimensional seismic testing of the refuge’s coastal plain, according to a request for proposals posted last summer with an early August deadline. 
The only available seismic data for the area is dated by three decades and was gathered with less-advanced technology. As a result, no one knows how much crude actually lies beneath the plain, though the U.S. Geological Survey estimates it could be anywhere between four-to-11 billion barrels of oil. A more exact read will require heavy trucks with treads to roll across the snowy tundra sending acoustic signals below to detect oil and gas deposits. 
The Gwich’in and others warn in their amended complaint that the heavy equipment could harm maternal polar bears who make their dens and give birth in the snow along the coastal plain.
In its Thursday statement, AIDEA said the Gwich’in lawsuit “misses the mark.” 
“The Coastal Plain represents an estimated $2.3 billion a year from multiple revenue sources to the State of Alaska and royalties to grow and build the Permanent Fund.  Revenue that would be extremely helpful to the State Treasury,” it said.
The case is before U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason who determined, last year, that the Biden administration did not have the legal authority to cancel AIDEA’s leases.

Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, is proposing that lawmakers take up the issue during next week’s special session, but first he’ll need to pitch it to the Legislative Management committee.
The bill draft mirrors a proposed constitutional ballot measure that could be on the November ballot if supporters gather enough signatures. But while the ballot measure would add the meal program to the state constitution, the bill would add the program to state law, making it easier for lawmakers to adjust if the program becomes unsustainable.

“We need the flexibility for future legislatures in case we hit financially hard times,” Nathe said.
If advanced by Legislative Management, the bill will be introduced and debated by the full Legislature during a special session that begins Wednesday.
The Together for School Meals coalition spearheaded the ballot measure after lawmakers last year rejected two similar bills that aimed to provide free school meals to students. Instead, lawmakers narrowly expanded the number of families that qualify for free or reduced lunch.
The ballot measure would require public schools to provide free breakfast and lunch to students. Private schools, Bureau of Indian Education schools and other tribal schools could opt in to participate in the program. 
North Dakota lawmakers weigh impact of free school meal proposal

Under Nathe’s bill, the state’s free school meals program would start this fall, while the ballot measure would start the program in fall 2027.
The bill has a $65 million appropriation attached to it for the first year, with funding coming from the state Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund. That figure is on par with what the Department of Public Instruction has estimated the program will cost per year, although the agency has said the cost is difficult to project.
“When we come back in January 2027, we’ll have half a school year under our belt and we’ll see what’s working and what’s not working and we can adjust,” Nathe said. “At that time, we’ll figure out the funding going forward for the next biennium.”
Providing free school meals would provide about $1,000 in savings per student for North Dakota families, said Nick Archuleta, president of ND United and a member of the ballot measure sponsoring committee
“This is everything we’ve asked for, for two legislative sessions in a row,” Archuleta said. “We are absolutely going to support the passage of this.”
Previously, Robin Nelson, chair of the sponsoring committee, said the group remains cautiously optimistic about Nathe’s bill, but will move forward with signature gathering for the proposed ballot measure.
Legislative Management meets at 1 p.m. Tuesday to discuss the school meal proposal and other bills lawmakers plan to pitch for the special session. Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, who chairs that committee, has previously said he is not in favor of relitigating issues the Legislature debated last session.
If the committee does not advance a bill, a lawmaker could still attempt to introduce it from the Senate or House floor. The bill would need support from at least two-thirds of the members to be introduced.

Greg Gianforte formally requested a presidential major disaster declaration this week for a windstorm late last year.
The windstorm impacted most of the state, toppling trees and powerlines, blocking roads and generally creating hazardous driving conditions. The winds lasted for hours, as winds from the upper atmosphere blasted the state, with some areas just beginning the early recovery process from devastating floods.
Some schools also lost their roof in the storm, five in all, Gianforte said in a press release. And in one of those schools, vermiculite asbestos was found.
In a press release from his office, Gianforte stated the ask from the federal government for windstorm damages is $6.5 million. Flooding in western Montana, which Gianforte also asked for a separate presidential disaster declaration on Jan. 9, totaled almost $10 million.
“The totality of impact from the most detrimental windstorm in 30 years is estimated to be $13.3 million,” Gianforte said in a press release. “Damages, response, and recovery efforts impacted 45 of 56 Montana Counties, five of seven Tribal Nations including one with significant water system damages, five school districts, and 19 of 25 Rural Electrical Cooperatives. Damage from the storm is spread across 80 percent of Montana.”
Gianforte went on to say the damage was “unparalleled for this time of year.”

A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups, as well as Democrats in Santa Fe, are calling on the Legislature to pass additional immigrant protection measures during the session beginning Jan. 20, 2026. (Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM)A group of eight New Mexico immigrant advocacy groups say they’ll push the Legislature to expand data privacy protections and increase funding for services during the session beginning Tuesday. 
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office has said the governor will include for consideration a proposal banning public entities from enabling immigrant detention during the 30-day session, which is otherwise focused primarily on passing the state budget. 
Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos said in a news release this week that they support the detention measure, known as the “Immigrant Safety Act.” 
“The Immigrant Safety Act is a critical step to protect New Mexican families by closing existing gaps in state law and prohibiting new detention contracts,” the groups said in a statement. 
But they are also calling on lawmakers to go farther to protect immigrants. They released a platform in English and Spanish calling on the Legislature to restrict the sharing of license plate data; make permanent the existing Office of New Americans; expand funds for immigrant legal services; and expand workforce development opportunities for immigrants. 
NM governor will include proposed ban on immigrant detention on legislative agenda

Groups comprising the “New Mexico Immigration Legislation Working Group” include Contigo Immigrant Justice, the Semilla Project, Semilla Action, CAFé Accion and the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, along with the ACLU and El Centro. 
“During these unprecedented times of uncertainty and growing challenges for immigrant communities, it is essential that we work together to promote safety, expand opportunity, and support our families across New Mexico,” the groups said in a statement. 
On Friday, the Democratic Party of Santa Fe endorsed a similar platform, including a “New Mexico Driver Safety and Privacy Act” that the party says would ensure people “residing in New Mexico and engaged in lawful and constitutionally protected activities would not have their private and confidential information shared with any agency seeking to detain or deport them.” 
Earlier this week, New Mexico Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) and Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos) pre-filed legislation that sought to provide “limitations on the sharing of automated license plate reader information and requiring reporting,” according to the bill description. 
The bill text was not immediately available, House Democratic leaders said during a news conference Friday, but they said they are pushing for the legislation. 
By the #s: See where the New Mexico governor, Legislature disagree on $11B in budget priorities

The advocacy groups said the state currently has “no limits” on automatic license plate reader technology, which means outside organizations including the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency can access it. 
So they called on the Legislature to pass a bill that “would establish guardrails so surveillance data cannot be misused against immigrants, patients seeking medical care, or protesters,” the coalition said in a statement. “The Legislature must adopt these protections to safeguard privacy and prevent federal overreach.”
Regarding the immigrant detention legislation, Democrats in the majority have said they have reached a consensus on the bill and are hoping to pass the “Immigrant Safety Act” within the first two weeks of the session. 
But Republicans said Thursday they oppose the legislation that they said would undermine federal immigration law and also would devastate local economies. 
“The only outcome of ‘banning’ ICE Detention Facilities in New Mexico would be the destruction of New Mexico jobs and economic support for local communities,” Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) said in a statement. “Furthermore, by disrupting the enforcement of federal law with this virtue-signaling, Democrat lawmakers would enable violent criminals, who are in the United States illegally, the ability to continue terrorizing our neighborhoods.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9797-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

It could come to an end under legislation filed in response to Hasbro’s plan to move out of the Ocean State. (Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles)As Pawtucket-based Hasbro Inc. makes its move to Boston later this year, one Rhode Island lawmaker thinks the state should stop issuing new license plates featuring one of the company’s most iconic toys.
Legislation introduced Wednesday by Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican, would repeal the 2002 law that created the Mr. Potato Head plates to commemorate the toy’s 50th anniversary and raise money for the Rhode Island Community Food Bank.
Newberry told Rhode Island Current Friday that repealing future production of the plates is “a matter of self-respect” for the state. 
Hasbro to move to Boston Seaport by end of 2026

“Hasbro has abandoned Rhode Island and there’s no reason we should be advertising their products on our license plates,” Newberry said. “It’s as simple as that — to make a point.”
The toymaker announced last September that it would move to Boston’s Seaport by the end of 2026 to the dismay of state leaders who scrambled to put together a counteroffer to try to keep Hasbro and its 1,000-member workforce in the Ocean State. They tried to entice the company to buy a prime piece of undeveloped land in the I-195 Redevelopment District for $1.
The 765 drivers who still have the special plates affixed to their vehicles would be able to keep them, Newberry noted. But their plates would not be allowed to be transferred to other vehicles, according to the legislation.
Newberry’s bill was referred to the House Committee Special Legislation, which has not yet scheduled a hearing on the proposal. 
As of this year, the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles issues 17 different charity license plate designs, ranging from shortfin mako sharks promoting the Atlantic Shark Institute to a Rose Island Lighthouse graphic featuring the Claiborne Pell Bridge — a design the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association named the world’s best last year.
State law authorizes the DMV to issue the charity plates after obtaining 600 pre-orders within five years of their creation by the state. 
“Some groups never reach the production minimum and their plate design option is pulled,” Paul Grimaldi, a spokesperson for the DMV said in an email.
But the only way to get an already-in production plate out of production is for the General Assembly to pull the plug— a power even the DMV hasn’t seen before.
“To the best of our knowledge this is the first time authorization for a plate that’s been issued would be repealed,” Grimaldi wrote.
Launched in 2002, the plates which say “Help End Hunger,” cost $43.50 to purchase. Half of the proceeds go to the DMV, while the rest go to the food bank.
Since its introduction over two decades ago, sales of the license plates have raised more than $60,000 for the Providence-based nonprofit — most of which came in the first few years of the plates’ existence, food bank spokesperson Kate MacDonald said.
“It was at a time when Mr. Potato Head was popping up everywhere!” she said in an email. “It hasn’t been as popular in the last few years.”
MacDonald declined to comment on Newberry’s legislation, but understands the negative feelings toward Hasbro after the company announced in September it would abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots after months of speculation about the company’s future in the Ocean State.
Should state leaders adopt Newberry’s repeal, MacDonald said the food bank is open to a new charity plate design. Newberry already had one in mind.
“Let’s come up with one with the Big Blue Bug,” he said, referring to Nibbles Woodaway, the giant termite mascot of Big Blue Bug Solutions on Interstate 95 in Providence.

Una victoria reciente puso fin a un despliegue de la Guardia Nacional en Los Ángeles.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
A finales de diciembre, la situación cambió radicalmente en contra de la decisión de la administración Trump de desplegar la Guardia Nacional en tres estados, a pesar de las objeciones de sus gobernadores, incluido el de California.
 En primer lugar, el 23 de diciembre, la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos falló a favor de Illinois en su intento de impedir que Trump enviara la Guardia Nacional a Chicago como parte de su ofensiva contra la inmigración. El tribunal rechazó el mismo razonamiento legal que Trump utilizó para federalizar y desplegar la Guardia Nacional en Los Ángeles el verano pasado cuando estallaron las protestas allí.
“El gobierno no ha cumplido con su carga de demostrar que (la ley) permite al Presidente federalizar la Guardia en el ejercicio de la autoridad inherente para proteger al personal y la propiedad federal en Illinois”, se lee en la orden de la Corte Suprema.
 Luego, la administración retiró discretamente su apelación contra la decisión de un tribunal federal que establecía que el presidente no podía mantener a las tropas de la Guardia Nacional de California bajo control federal a perpetuidad. Esta retirada representó una victoria para el fiscal general de California, Rob Bonta, quien había presentado un escrito amicus curiae en el caso de Illinois.
 “La ley se desarrolló de tal manera que evitará que lo ocurrido en los últimos seis meses se repita”, dijo Bonta. “Creo que esta puerta está cerrada para Trump”.
 CalMatters habló con Bonta esta semana sobre estos casos y su opinión sobre el enfoque actual de la administración Trump en Minneapolis . La entrevista ha sido ligeramente editada para mayor claridad.
CalMatters: En términos de lo que el estado de California hará a continuación sobre este tema, ¿hay algo que estén haciendo en preparación para tal vez que (las redadas de inmigración a gran escala) regresen, o tal vez una escalada en tácticas como las que estamos viendo en Minnesota?
 Bonta: Estamos preparados para cualquier cosa. Creo que cuando se ven incidentes como los de Minnesota, hay que asumir que podría ocurrir aquí en California.
Ya saben, la administración Trump no ha ocultado nada. Van tras los estados demócratas, y solo a por ellos. Y es político, es instrumentalización, es partidista. Intentan controlar a los liberales y a los demócratas. Esa es su razón de ser. Y, sobre todo, el estado más grande del país, que ha rechazado a Trump tres veces durante su campaña, le molesta, no le gusta.
 CalMatters: En Los Ángeles, no recuerdo que fueran puerta por puerta para intentar atrapar gente como vemos en Minnesota. ¿Es esto una escalada?
Bonta: Creo que están escalando. Minnesota muestra que parece haber una escalada. O sea, hubo algunos momentos similares, horribles, aterradores, traumatizantes e inapropiados, como quitar las placas de matrícula, usar camiones de mudanzas, llegar a un Home Depot y ver a la gente salir corriendo por la parte trasera, y toda la discriminación racial (racial profiling) que se estaba cometiendo.
 Creo que es una escalada, y están haciendo más. Están intentando atacar duramente a Minneapolis y Minnesota. Es el hogar del candidato a la vicepresidencia que compitió contra Trump, ¿verdad? Es el lugar donde su racismo se manifiesta plenamente con sus ataques a los somalíes. Es donde el YouTuber intentaba insinuar que había guarderías sin niños y que había algo inapropiado en lo que mostraba.
 Minnesota es un objetivo importante ahora mismo. California siempre lo ha sido, y creo que nos volverán a poner en la mira en algún momento, y estaremos preparados.

 CalMatters: ¿Qué pasó en la Corte Suprema?
 Bonta: La Corte Suprema intervino y básicamente dijo que la teoría sobre la que el presidente había estado operando todo este tiempo era completamente ilegal y sin fundamento, realmente una bofetada en la cara y una pérdida vergonzosa y devastadora para Trump, quien cree que siempre puede acudir a la Corte Suprema y obtener lo que quiere.
 Y cumplieron la ley, la ley que, según argumentamos, siempre se aplicó, y que no tenían autoridad para desplegar al ejército, que las “fuerzas regulares” incluían a las fuerzas militares. No se analizó su incapacidad para ejecutar la ley, y que ni siquiera tenían autoridad para ejecutar ninguna ley, dada la Ley Posse Comitatus (que impide al presidente utilizar al ejército como fuerza policial nacional). Así que fue una derrota devastadora e impactante para Trump.
 CalMatters: El Tribunal de Apelaciones del Noveno Circuito de EE. UU. autorizó al gobierno de Trump a desplegar la Guardia Nacional en Los Ángeles en junio, pero emitió un fallo diferente seis meses después. El razonamiento del juez de distrito fue que Trump no podía refederalizar las tropas indefinidamente.
 Pero ¿eso le indica que si las condiciones materiales en Los Ángeles cambiaran, como lo mencionó la administración Trump en junio cuando afirmó que los manifestantes estaban cometiendo actos violentos contra personal y propiedad federal, la administración Trump podría autorizar un nuevo despliegue? ¿Es así como lo entiende, o me equivoco?
Bonta: Creo que estás equivocado, pero no creo que sea algo descabellado decirlo. Déjame explicarte mi razonamiento.
En el caso de Los Ángeles, en junio, fue el primero en todo el país, y el ejercicio de la autoridad de la administración federal aquí, al desplegar las fuerzas armadas, implica una gran deferencia. Creo que se demostró esa deferencia. Fue el primer caso. Hubo protestas mayoritariamente pacíficas, pero también hubo violencia, como se acaba de mencionar.
 Era la primera vez que veían lo que la administración Trump estaba haciendo aquí.
Y luego lo volvieron a ver en Washington D. C. Luego lo volvieron a ver en Portland, y lo volvieron a ver en Illinois. Los jueces vieron lo que estaba sucediendo, lo que se decía y la justificación. Vieron cómo Trump dijo que Portland era una zona de guerra cuando era una ciudad pacífica. Vieron cómo Trump dice: ‘Voy a usar a los militares para hacer precisamente lo que prohíbe la Ley Posse Comitatus, para hacer cumplir la ley penal, porque estas ciudades demócratas no están tomando medidas enérgicas contra la delincuencia’. ¡Justamente lo que los militares no pueden hacer!
Y entonces vieron lo que estaba haciendo con los militares y creo que se hicieron una idea de hacia dónde se dirigía realmente esto y de lo que estaba sucediendo aquí. … Así que ahora que la Corte Suprema de los EE. UU. ha dicho que hay que asegurarse de que las ‘fuerzas regulares’ sean fuerzas militares, hay que demostrar que todas las fuerzas militares no pueden impedir que se lance el bloque de hormigón ni el cóctel molotov (nunca podrá demostrarlo), entonces se puede recurrir a la Guardia Nacional.
 CalMatters: Solo una acotación al respecto. Dadas las circunstancias actuales, si se repitiera lo ocurrido en junio, ¿sería diferente la conversación si las condiciones materiales sobre el terreno cambiaran en Los Ángeles?
 Bonta: Sí, totalmente diferente. Acudiríamos a los tribunales de inmediato, ganaríamos, obtendríamos una orden judicial y el Noveno Circuito la ratificaría. Porque no habría pruebas de que las fuerzas armadas, todas las fuerzas armadas —es decir, miles de militares, hay múltiples bases militares en California— no pudieran impedir que una sola persona lanzara concreto. Creo que nuestras fuerzas armadas son plenamente capaces de eso.
 Entonces, las mismas circunstancias exactas de junio ocurren hoy, el 9º Circuito lo confirma y no lo suspende.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625-Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem-MG-CM-18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523
,DC,2026-01-16 21:05:20+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,The 5 biggest legal fights in the first year of Trump’s mass deportation push,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/5-biggest-legal-fights-first-year-trumps-mass-deportation-push,,"WASHINGTON — The first year of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House was defined by clashes with the judiciary branch, as the president and his administration pushed forward with an aggressive immigration agenda.In the past year, the Trump administration has aimed to drastically change immigration policy in the United States, including by stripping millions of immigrants of their legal status and attempting to redefine the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.  The moves have often run directly against the judiciary branch. Federal judges briefly stalled the Trump administration’s plans to deploy the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, for immigration enforcement. They also blocked the invocation of an archaic wartime law to expel immigrants from the country — a move that raised concerns, all the way up to the Supreme Court, about skirting the due process rights of immigrants.In response, the president for the last year frequently battled with federal judges, such as in June, when the Justice Department sued all judges in federal court in Maryland over a two-day pause in deportations to ensure due process rights for immigrants.Trump also fixated on certain judges that put his policies on hold, such as the District of Columbia’s Chief Judge James Emanuel Boasberg.Boasberg blocked the Trump administration from deporting certain immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and ordered the return of deportation flights that, despite his restraining order, still landed at a brutal prison in El Salvador. Trump’s singling out of Boasberg in late March, and calling for his impeachment, prompted a rare rebuke from conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.But the Supreme Court has often handed wins to the Trump administration on numerous emergency appeals. The high court allowed for deportations of immigrants to countries they have no ties to, referred to as third-country removals, and allowed the use of race in immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The president has found himself at odds with a range of groups in response to his harsh immigration policy.A group of Quakers sued the Department of Homeland Security after officials removed a so-called sensitive locations policy that limited immigration enforcement in places of worship. The Trump administration also faced backlash in its attempt to quickly deport Guatemalan children in the middle of the night, where a Trump nominated judge said the Department of Justice’s arguments for the move “crumbled like a house of cards.”Out of the dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration, here are the five most significant court cases related to the president’s immigration policies:Alien Enemies ActLast March, two deportation planes carrying immigrants removed under an 18th-century wartime law were ordered to return to the U.S. by Boasberg, chief judge for the District Court for the District of Columbia. But the planes still landed in El Salvador, and 137 Venezuelan men were sent to a brutal prison known as CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The wartime law would apply to any Venezuelan national 14 and older who was suspected of being a member of the Tren de Aragua gang. Boasberg then spent months probing whether Trump officials defied his order to turn the planes around. Last month, he concluded that the deportations were illegal and carried out in defiance of his order.The 137 Venezuelan men were eventually released from CECOT last summer through a prisoner exchange. Boasberg determined that even though the men are no longer imprisoned, they still need to be afforded their due process rights and he ordered the Trump administration to propose a way to afford those due process rights. In the latest major development, last month he directed the administration to create a plan on how to do that, such as providing some form of video interview before an immigration judge. The Trump administration has argued because of the U.S. military operations to extract Venezuela's president from the county, the situation is fluid, and they cannot provide a timeline for complying with Boasberg's order from last month. The Justice Department’s most recent filing, from Jan. 12, objects to the court's order to facilitate remote due process hearings, and “given the current political instability in Venezuela, there is a serious risk of intentional interference with remote proceedings.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio also submitted a Jan. 12 declaration to the court, saying that “introducing the matter of the disposition of the 137 class members into these discussions at this time would risk material damage to U.S. foreign policy interests in Venezuela.” He added that the U.S. does not know where the 137 Venezuelan men are. “Given the passage of time, the U.S. government does not know—nor does it have any way of knowing—the whereabouts of class members, including whether anyone has departed Venezuela or whether the regime subsequently took anyone back into custody,” Rubio said. Kilmar Abrego GarciaThe wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and longtime Maryland man, cast a national spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia’s case has highlighted the Trump administration's appetite for mass deportations. The case started last March in the District Court of the District of Maryland, after Trump officials mistakenly removed Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite removal protections placed by an immigration judge in 2019 because it was likely Abrego Garcia would face violence if returned to his home country. But in March, Abrego Garcia was placed on a plane, along with Venezuelans removed under the Alien Enemies Act, to the brutal El Salvador mega-prison known as CECOT.Federal Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return, but the Trump administration took the issue all the way to the Supreme Court, arguing that it could not force another government to comply with the U.S.The Supreme Court sided with Abrego Garcia, but stopped short of ordering his return.   Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. several months later to face a criminal indictment in Tennessee over allegations of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges, and another federal judge has found cause that the Justice Department brought the indictment in a vindictive move against Abrego Garcia.Since his return, Abrego Garcia has detailed psychological and physical torture he experienced at CECOT. The Trump administration has also tried to remove him to a country to which he has no ties because of the 2019 removal protections.Trump officials re-detained Abrego Garcia and have tried to remove him to the African nations of Eswatini, Ghana, Uganda and Liberia, despite Costa Rica’s willingness to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and his willingness to go. For that reason, Xinis ordered Abrego Garcia’s release from an ICE facility in Pennsylvania and barred the Trump administration from re-detaining him. She is currently overseeing Abrego Garcia’s challenge to his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal. A Jan. 14 hearing was the most recent development in Abrego Garcia’s case. There, Xinis briefly conferred with his lawyers and Department of Justice attorneys regarding the timing of a final order of removal for Abrego Garcia was issued — the question was whether it was in 2019 or January 2025. The timing of the order of removal could determine whether the Trump administration can re-detain Abrego Garcia for removal. Xinis in December ordered Abrego Garcia’s release, because she determined the Trump administration was unlawfully detaining him and said ICE failed repeatedly to show a final order of removal existed.Xinis said she plans to make a final decision in Abrego Garcia’s case by Feb. 12.Birthright CitizenshipOne of Trump’s first executive orders he signed on Inauguration Day was ending the constitutional right to birthright citizenship. Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status. There is a small carve-out for the children born of diplomats. If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship and it would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.In response to Trump’s executive order, multiple lawsuits were filed and lower courts across the country have granted preliminary injunctions against the order. One of the challenges to birthright citizenship, brought by Democratic attorneys general, made its way to the Supreme Court, but the Trump administration asked the justices to weigh in on the issue of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts, rather than the merits of birthright citizenship. The justices decided on an order that limited nationwide injunctions, such as class action suits. The merits of birthright citizenship are now before the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear oral arguments in February. That birthright citizenship case is Barbara v. Trump, which stems from a case in New Hampshire. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction to bar the executive order from taking effect against a class of babies born on or after Feb. 20, 2025. Those children would have been denied citizenship under the president's executive order.  Lawmakers’ Access to ICE Facilities As the Trump administration continues with aggressive immigration enforcement and detention, one of the few tools Democrats have, as the minority party, is oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. More than 60,000 immigrants are detained across various ICE facilities in the country, and Democrats argue they need access to conduct oversight at the facilities. Under a 2019 appropriations law, any lawmaker can carry out an unannounced visit at a federal facility that holds immigrants. But after several Democrats were denied access to ICE facilities in July, due to a policy instituted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that required seven days notice, a dozen House Democrats sued. Last month, a federal judge granted the lawmakers' request to stay the new policy by Noem. But after Minnesota lawmakers said they were denied an oversight visit to an ICE facility following a deadly shooting by an immigration officer in Minneapolis, Democrats were back in court Jan. 14.Noem required a seven-day notice, nearly identical to the policy that initially prompted the suit from Democrats last year. The federal judge handling the case, Jia Cobb, is probing whether the Trump administration has violated her court order.Democrats who sued include: Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.Expanded Use of Expedited Removal A pillar of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign is the expanded use of expedited removal. The Trump policy allows the removal of immigrants through the interior of the country without an appearance before an immigration judge.In March, immigration advocacy groups sued the Trump administration over the policy, arguing it stripped due process rights of immigrants. In August, the District Court for the District of Columbia issued a stay in the policy, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from using it. The Department of Justice appealed, and in September a panel of appellate judges denied the Trump administration’s request to lift the lower courts’ stay. Most recently, in December, the Trump administration defended the merits of its fast-track deportation policy before a panel of judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The Department of Justice argued that immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years without legal authorization are not guaranteed due process.",,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)The First District Court of Appeal is looking to fill a seat — the one vacated by Adam Tanenbaum, who was elevated this week to the Florida Supreme Court by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The First District, located in Tallahassee, is the most important state court aside from the Supreme Court itself, as it adjudicates cases arising from state law and policy, such as the high-profile redistricting case Byrd v. Black Voters Matter.
Applicants must live within the jurisdiction of the court and have been a member of the Florida Bar for the preceding 10 years.
The Judicial Nominating Commission is accepting applications until Feb. 9. The commission will meet next month to review applications and schedule interviews. The group then meets and vets candidates to create a group of candidates to advance to the governor. The governor then gets to appoint a candidate to fill the vacancy.
There are 13 seats on the court.
The court now consists of Chief Judge Timothy Osterhaus and judges Joseph Lewis Jr., L. Clayton Roberts, Lori S. Rowe, Stephanie W. Ray, Ross L. Bilbrey, Susan L. Kelsey, Thomas D. Winokur, Kemmerly Thomas, Rachel E. Nordby, Robert E. Long Jr., and Raymond F. Treadwell.

Andrea Hunley, the Indiana Senate’s second-ranking Democrat, isn’t seeking reelection this year amid speculation that she’ll be a 2027 candidate for Indianapolis mayor.
Hunley announced Friday she would give up her Senate seat, becoming the fourth state senator to say this will be their final legislative session.
At least six Indiana House members also won’t be seeking new terms, with the latest decision coming from Republican Rep. Brad Barrett of Richmond, who is chair of the House Public Health Committee.
Hunley is the Senate’s assistant minority leader after winning election in 2022 from a heavily Democratic district covering much of central Marion County.
Hunley, a former teacher and school principal, said she would complete her Senate term that runs until November. Hunley did not address talk of a mayoral campaign although her statement said she “continues to discern how she will be called to serve next.”
“While my role may change, my commitment to this work will not, “ she said in the statement. “Our city needs bold leadership to be a world class destination for people to work, play, study, and stay. I am not going anywhere.”
Although Democratic Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett hasn’t said whether he’ll seek a fourth term in the 2027 election, former City-County Council President Vop Osili announced this week he was running for mayor.
Other incumbent decisions
Barrett, meanwhile, recently released a statement saying he would not seek reelection and leave the House after eight years representing Wayne County and part of Henry County.

Barrett, a retired general surgeon, has led the House Public Health Committee since the 2021 session.
Candidates have until Feb. 6 to file for the 25 Indiana Senate and 100 Indiana House seats up for election this year.
Besides Hunley, Republican Sens. Eric Bassler of Washington and Kyle Walker of Indianapolis are not seeking reelection. Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford of Indianapolis is running for a congressional seat.
Other House members not seeking new terms are Republicans Mike Karickhoff of Kokomo and Shane Lindauer of Jasper and Democrat Sue Errington of Muncie.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  BlueCross BlueShield’s new CEO takes over as insurer faces federal and statewide challenges.","On Saturday, Beth Roberts officially took the helm as the new president and CEO of BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont.
Less than a week later, the window closed on open enrollment for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans, without any extension of the federal tax credits that made those plans affordable for thousands of Vermonters.
It’s no secret that Roberts assumes the role as the health care industry — and her new employer, specifically — faces dire straits.

BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont has faced serious risks to its solvency and intensely butted heads with Vermont’s main hospital system. All the while, Vermonters face some of the highest health care costs in the country. 
In an interview with VTDigger, Roberts said she was optimistic she will turn a new page on affordability in the state. 
“My career has been built on running towards the fire,” she said. “Even though it’s in a very complicated state right here, and health care is in a complicated way right now, I think there’s a lot of great work that can be done.” 
Prior to joining BlueCross BlueShield, Roberts worked as president of the Beth Israel Lahey Health Performance Network, a Boston-area health care provider. Prior to that, she built her career in health insurance groups across New England, including 20 years working at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. 
During her time at Beth Israel Lahey, she worked on negotiating contracts between the hospitals and health insurers — something that’s primed her, she said, for a healthier collaboration with the University of Vermont Health network. In negotiating past contracts and rates, the insurer and hospital network have had an “ongoing adversarial relationship,” as a state-appointed liaison described it, in part over the costs of care for patients covered by BlueCross BlueShield.
In October, the health network gained new leadership under Steve Leffler, who was officially named CEO in January after serving as interim following former CEO Sunny Eappen’s decision to step down in the fall.
Roberts joined BlueCross BlueShield on Nov. 10, and worked with outgoing president and CEO Don George to transfer responsibilities during the two months they overlapped.
Both of the new leaders at UVM and BlueCross negotiated the new contract for 2026. The outcome was “a better deal than what was expected,” Roberts said, though she did not elaborate further. That work has been a primary piece of Roberts’ first few months in the role.
“I think there was a strong desire by both BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont and UVM Health network to do something different,” she said. 
She sees more room for cooperation with the state’s hospitals, beyond UVM, like trying to “cut down the noise” and streamline policies across providers and insurers, so that there is less time spent tailoring rates for specific plans and providers. She also noted that the hospitals and insurers can share resources better — things like care managers and quality experts that each entity has. 
Both the hospital and the insurer are facing the loss of federal enhanced premium tax credits, the subsidies that made plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace actually affordable for thousands of Vermonters. 
Early data from the Department of Vermont Health Access shows that more than 2,000 people across the state unenrolled from those marketplace plans (including BlueCross BlueShield and MVP Health Care). 
Roberts said she is working on finding affordable pathways for those who have lost these subsidies. 
She said the insurer is working with Vermont legislators and the regulator to find “wiggle room” in what the plans cover, to make them less expensive. 
She is also exploring whether there is appetite for less expensive plans that cover preventative, wellness care and catastrophic care, without as much coverage for some standard care types that fall in the middle of that range of coverage.
“Affordable” has become something of a buzzword in the Vermont health care space — and Roberts is no exception to that. But she said she’s also added a new adjective to the mix: sustainable. 
She knows that bringing down premium costs in Vermont and making care affordable again is going to take a long, sustained effort. 
“We are so far off the mark on affordability in Vermont, with (spending on healthcare) being 19.6% of household income,” she said. “It is going to take a lot of years to get from the 19.6% to a more reasonable level, so we have to keep our eye on that frame for a duration of time before we can shift down.”

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)Retaliatory tariffs could have harsh economic consequences for North Carolina’s agricultural sector, according to a new report from the John Locke Foundation.
Over the past year, President Donald Trump has raised tariffs on foreign imports to the U.S. Major trade partners like the European Union, China and Canada imposed retaliatory tariffs in response, leading to trade wars and increased prices across the board.
“How Tariffs Threaten North Carolina Agriculture: NC Farmers at Risk,” authored by Jeffrey Dorfman at North Carolina State University, estimates the tariffs could cost the state’s farmers about $695 million.
This figure represents roughly a third of average net farm income in North Carolina.
“Such a contraction would lead to a total of roughly 8,000 lost jobs, both directly in the agriculture industry along with the ripple effects from that lost revenue,” Dorfman wrote. “The job losses would be concentrated in North Carolina’s rural communities.”
Other indirect effects on the state’s rural economy would result in an additional $1.2 billion in estimated revenue losses, Dorfman wrote. This brings the potential total economic losses as a result of trade policy retaliation to $1.9 billion, which is more than 2% of North Carolina’s gross state product.
Donald Bryson, CEO of the Locke Foundation, a free-market think tank, said the organization commissioned the study because it has become increasingly concerned about the effect of recent agricultural policies on the state’s food supply chain.
“We are an export-dependent state,” he said. “Agriculture is the largest sector of North Carolina’s economy, and we wanted to know how this is going to be affected by the tariff regime.”
North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said tariffs are often difficult to quantify because a lot depends on short-term versus long-term impacts.
Troxler said they’re usually used as bargaining tools.
“If tariffs result in a more open market, that can be beneficial in the long term, but when it gets into a trade war, it does do harm in the short term,” Troxler said in a statement to NC Newsline. “It’s hard to paint tariffs with just one paintbrush.”
North Carolina ranks 15th in the country for exports and 13th for imports by dollar value. It’s also eighth for total gross farm sales of crops and livestock — especially poultry and hogs.
Farmers in the state have a limited set of options for minimizing damage from agricultural exports, Dorfman wrote. These include looking for new markets and focusing on domestic trade.
“Still, while all these are worth pursuing, they are not likely to be sufficient — especially in the short run — to mitigate the risks North Carolina farmers currently face from a potentially damaging tariff regime,” the report read.
The U.S. exported $24.5 billion worth of soybeans in 2024, with China, Mexico, and the EU as the top markets. North Carolina contributes heavily to soybean production.
Soybeans are the U.S.’s top agricultural export, but North Carolina soybeans are rarely exported; instead, they are used domestically to feed local pigs, chickens and turkeys.
Although the state’s soybeans go almost exclusively to animal feed, they are not protected from the risks of trade policy retaliation, Dorfman wrote. China chose not to buy American soybeans for much of 2025, causing the domestic supply of soybeans to soar and lowering their price in U.S. markets.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0628-scaled-e1768596460674-1024x758.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)DETROIT – U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens said Friday that the federal government’s most controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement deployments have happened in cities without input from local officials who don’t want or need their assistance with law enforcement activities.
Stevens, who was in Detroit on Friday to detail a new minority-focused policy initiative in her campaign for the U.S. Senate, spoke to Michigan Advance following the event to talk about her campaign and other pressing topics in national and state politics.
On ICE and its recent flurry of activity in Minneapolis, which led to the shooting death of an American citizen, Stevens said President Donald Trump’s iteration of the agency has by and large circumvented state and local law enforcement, in effect escalating tensions that already existed between activists and ICE as it slides into alarmingly authoritarian behavior.
She said time and again, local officials have pleaded with the administration not to take these actions, as it “will only escalate tension and make things worse.”
Stevens said with Trump now toying with invoking the Insurrection Act to prevent activists from tracking ICE activities and to end the resistance brewing against the agency, she has introduced legislation to close loopholes that allows him to do so.
“Trump has deployed a mismanaged federal agency into a city, in a neighborhood,” Stevens said, adding that whether it’s in Minnesota or here in Michigan, local officials need to be heard.
“I know how deeply important that is,” Stevens said.

Trump has in the last week threatened to cut funding to any state with openly defiant sanctuary city policies, and the impact in Michigan remains unknown. The U.S. Department of Justice has only identified one city in Michigan — East Lansing — as being designated as a sanctuary city for immigrants seeking refuge from federal enforcement.
That list is longer, however, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank. The group lists six Michigan counties — Kalamazoo, Leelanau, Muskegon, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne counties —as having some level of sanctuary policies.
The president has also made references to sending ICE or other federalized National Guard troops to Detroit, but officials have rebuffed that notion, noting that Detroit was not a sanctuary city. Still, that hasn’t stopped Republicans in the state and on the national stage from setting their sights on Detroit as another test for Trump’s incursions into states with federal forces.
In the case of Minnesota, some have called on Gov. Tim Walz to deploy the state’s National Guard troops as a hedge between federal ICE and Border Patrol agents and citizens, both to cool down tensions but to also prevent ICE from abusing its authority by targeting U.S. citizens with violence or unlawful arrests.
The Advance asked Stevens if she would support Gov. Gretchen Whitmer potentially doing the same if Trump decided to unleash ICE in Detroit or elsewhere in the state, and especially if ICE activity rises to the level of chaos in Michigan as it has in Minnesota.
“I think Gov. Whitmer has a tremendous track record of safety and security,” Stevens said. “We saw her leadership through the COVID-19 pandemic, and I have full faith and trust in her ability to keep Michiganders safe.”
On congressional softness against Trump, Stevens said she’s fighting back
One key source of frustration for Democrats and those who oppose Trump’s most hardline policies is that members of Congress in both chambers have done little to push back against the administrations and its worst abuses of power.
Stevens said she was not part of that camp.
“I’m very eager to call out the abuses of power we’re seeing in communities, particularly the mismanaged ICE that has brought a lot of chaos and concern,” Stevens said. “I’m hearing directly from Michiganders and, frankly, I am so frustrated and upset about what’s happening before our eyes.”
Despite accepting corporate PAC money, Stevens insists she can’t be bought
As Stevens continues her campaign for the U.S. Senate as the race’s frontrunner, up against state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and former health official Abdul El-Sayed, of Detroit, she faces continued criticisms from being the only Democrat in the race to have not sworn off corporate donations.
Progressives looking for a candidate to support may very well skip on Stevens due to her acceptance of corporate dollars and also her stance on the war in Gaza and ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people — Stevens is a staunch supporter of Israel but has called for a meaningful ceasefire and an end to the war.
The Advance asked Stevens if she is worried that those corporate dollars will be an anchor to her campaign as activists and her opponents continue to note those dollars in her coffers.
Stevens turned her attention not to her opponents, but rather the leading Republican in the race, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake.
“Mike Rogers says that he wants to rubber stamp Donald Trump. That’s going to be the agenda that is going to continue to increase costs and wreak havoc on our economy, like we’ve seen playing out,” Stevens said. “I can’t be bought. I’m the only person in this race who is not a millionaire. My record speaks for itself, and that’s a record of voting for comprehensive campaign finance reform as a House member and seeing it blocked by the Senate. And that is one of the reasons why I’m running for the United States Senate, to see us actually get comprehensive campaign finance reform done.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7010-scaled-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(CRMC File No. 2025-06-048)A Jamestown oyster farm is poised for expansion, after receiving unanimous approval from the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council on Tuesday.
The council’s swift stamp of approval lets Rocky Rhode Oyster Co. owner Brad Boehringer add 3.5 acres to his existing, 7.8-acre oyster farm in Jamestown’s Dutch Island Harbor.
The uncontested review was an anomaly in the increasingly contentious debate between oyster farmers, fishermen and coastal residents warring over use and views of state coastal waterways. Rhode Island’s aquaculture boom has spawned public protests, late-night hearings and lawsuits, with protracted regulatory reviews that, in some cases, span years. 
It helped that Boehringer’s existing expanse of oyster cases, 900 feet off the western shore off Dutch Island Harbor, falls within an area already designated by town and state officials for aquaculture use. 
Rocky Rhode is one of six aquaculture farms covering a combined 35 acres within a 90-acre area in Dutch Island Harbor designated for aquaculture use, according to a 2024 report. The report helped inform a working group of town officials and state environmental administrators in developing rules and regulations for future aquaculture development in the area. 
Boehringer’s southwest expansion aims to meet increasing commercial demand, enabling Boehringer to keep his eight seasonal residents employed year-round and boost production to reach 1 million oysters and 100,000 scallops a year, according to his June 2025 application. He already produces and harvests enough shellfish to service 45 area restaurants and five regional wholesales.
The 3.5-acre addition, a mix of bottom cages and floating baskets, received positive recommendations from the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, the Rhode Island Marine Fisheries Council, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to the CRMC staff report. 
A preliminary application reviewed by the Jamestown Harbor Commission in December 2024 also revealed “very few issues,” Benjamin Goetsch, CRMC aquaculture coordinator, wrote in the Dec. 15 report. In fact, the expansion could have been approved by staff, without a public hearing or review by the politically appointed council, if it weren’t for two written letters of objection.
The letters, both from seasonal Jamestown residents, laid out concerns with debris and sand filling from the expanded aquaculture activity, and potential conflicts with area sailing activity. The objectors did not attend the hearing on Tuesday.
Goetsch’s report refuted each of these claims, noting that all human activity on or near the water could create debris, and that the Coast Guard had already indicated no navigational interference.
Boehringer told the council Tuesday that he had a “very good working relationship” with the Conanicut Island Sailing Foundation, which is the primary group of sailors in the area. 
New non-rusting oyster cages avoid the risk that pieces chip off and collect in the water – a problem of older versions of the equipment no longer in use, Boehringer said.
The CRMC’s approval requires any lost gear or equipment be retrieved within 30 days. Boehringer will also have to put up a $40,000 performance bond to cover potential costs associated with gear removal or abandonment.
Boehringer declined to comment on the council’s decision when reached by email on Wednesday.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Pennsylvania’s Democratic congressional delegation is in broad agreement that investigations and accountability are needed following the aggressive tactics of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Minneapolis and around the country.
But at this point, they haven’t landed on a united path forward.
Last week, Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly introduced three articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has defended the confrontational actions of ICE and Border Patrol agents. Kelly’s district includes a Chicago area that saw heavy ICE deployment in the fall and the articles she submitted cite obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust and self-dealing.

Other Democrats have called for investigations, and reforms, cutting funding for immigration enforcement, or abolishing ICE altogether. 
But so far, only two Pennsylvania Democrats have signed on to an effort to remove Noem from office. Rep. Summer Lee, was among the first co-sponsors on the impeachment articles, while Chris Deluzio, who represents the broader Pittsburgh area, committed to adding his name to the co-sponsors, according to a spokesperson.
More than a week ago, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, as she tried to drive away from agents.

Footage of the shooting and the moments proceeding it went viral, stoking outrage and focusing the nation’s attention on the Trump administration’s militarized deportation campaign. But views among lawmakers split largely along partisan lines over whether the agent, who walked around the car to position himself in front of it when he fired the first shot, was acting in self-defense or using force unjustifiably. The second and third shots were fired from the side of the vehicle. 
The Capital-Star asked all eight Democrats in Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation how the House and Senate should respond to the shooting and the resulting unrest. Initial emails were sent before articles of impeachment were introduced this past Wednesday, and follow-ups were sent afterward.
While the Capital-Star’s questions included whether they supported impeachment, only Deluzio and Lee responded to the question directly.
“DHS agencies have demonstrated a pattern of violence against people with little to no accountability, emboldened by an administration that acts without impunity and adds fuel to the fire,” Lee said in a statement before articles of impeachment were introduced. “I would support articles of impeachment against this lawless administration.”
“It’s past time to abolish ICE once and for all,” Lee added.

“Renee Good’s killing in Minneapolis is a tragedy, and my heart goes out to her grieving family and community,” Deluzio said in a statement.” From what I’ve seen so far, it is outrageous and disturbing that the Trump Administration immediately called this a ‘domestic terrorism’ incident. We need an independent investigation—and for the Congress to bring real oversight and accountability to ICE and Secretary Noem’s failed leadership.”
Congressional Republicans have largely rallied around the federal officers and DHS’ defense of the shooting. 
The Capital-Star also reached out to the nine Republican members, but only one, Rep. Dan Meuser from Luzerne County, responded. A spokesperson sent the Capital-Star a Fox News interview from shortly after the killing of Good.
“I mean, law enforcement says, ‘Hey, stop, open up your door, let me see your ID,’ and then not only do you take off, but you go right at somebody as they jump out of the way of the car, basically you’re trying to run them over,” Meuser said. “That’s not what a normal person does to anyone, let alone law enforcement.”
President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security have claimed that Good was trying to hit the officer with her vehicle, and he was acting in self defense. The administration has also called Good’s a “domestic terrorist.” Immediately following the shooting, Noem said that Good, “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.” 
But Open Source Intelligence analysts at the New York Times, Bellingcat and the Washington Post all concluded that Good appeared to be driving away from the officer when he fired at her.
In the days following the shooting, protests against ICE erupted around the country, including in Pennsylvania. DHS ordered additional federal  agents to Minneapolis, where daily life has been disrupted for residents, schools and businesses. 
Where Pennsylvania’s other Democratic reps stand
Many of Deluzio and Lee’s Pennsylvania Democratic colleagues have stopped short of further action beyond calls for investigations and increased oversight. But, none ruled out support for impeachment.
U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-17th District)
Successfully removing Noem from office is unlikely. Impeachment would require a majority vote in the House, which Democrats don’t hold by a 218-213 margin. A two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict, which would require significant support from the Republican majority. 
Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-05), who has a background in immigration advocacy, agreed to an interview with the Capital-Star. She was unequivocal in her condemnation of the shooting of Good, and ICE’s use of force across the country under the Trump administration.
“The whole enforcement push with armed and masked agents in American cities has been dangerous from the start,” Scanlon said. “There have been multiple incidents where these ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents have pulled their guns on people on American streets. There seem to be some serious questions about training, about the conditions in which they should be engaging with people, and huge questions about who it is they’re pursuing.”
Asked what she would support to rein in the agency, including impeachment, Scanlon said that effective measures would require a “Democratic majority.”
“I think we’re constantly struggling with the gap between what we should be doing and what we can be doing in the minority,” Scanlon said. The reality is Congress can’t act without a majority, and right now Congressional Republicans are too afraid of Donald Trump to do what the country needs.”
She called for investigations into the shooting and how ICE is spending its money.
Scanlon, Lee and Deluzio were also among the six of Pennsylvania’s seven Democratic representatives in the House who signed onto a letter to Noem calling for DHS “to take immediate steps to preserve evidence, bring in unbiased investigative partners like the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and ensure the officers involved comply fully with investigators.”

The letter also included specific questions for DHS, including what kind of training the officers involved in Good’s shooting received and what steps the agency is taking to prevent recurring violence against civilians.
Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-02) was the lone Pennsylvania Democrat who did not sign the petition. He did, however, call for Noem’s resignation in a post on the social media platform X.
A spokesperson for Boyle did not respond to multiple questions from the Capital-Star about what steps the congressman would support to provide a check on immigration enforcement, including impeachment, but referred to a social media post he made.
“Kristi Noem is lying,” Boyle said. “We all saw the video. She must resign. And this heinous killing must be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law.”
A spokesperson for Rep. Dwight Evans (D-03) referred the Capital-Star to a social media post.
“I condemn this brutal murder in Minneapolis by ICE  agents,” Evans wrote. “There should be bipartisan outrage about this tragedy. The Republican majorities in Congress need to join with Democrats to demand reform and accountability. This violence cannot and should not be normalized.”
Democratic Reps. Madeleine Dean (D-04) and Chrissy Houlahan (D-06) did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star, but both called for investigations on social media. Houlahan also called for the firing of any official who lied about the circumstances of the shooting.
Pennsylvania Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman did not respond to the Capital-Star, but called the incident a tragedy in statements to the press last week.

Patrick Morrisey told the public Wednesday night during his State of the State address that he wanted a 10% personal income tax cut, saying it should be a priority to put more money back into people’s pockets.
The next morning, his finance staff presented a budget to Senators seeking a 5% cut, and the budget was calculated with a 5% tax cut included. 
The same reduced request went before members of the House Finance Committee on Friday, prompting Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, to ask, “What was the thought process in going with 10% on Wednesday night, and then coming back here 12 hours later and saying 5%?
In response, Department of Revenue Deputy Secretary Mike Muchow said the governor “wants at least 5% and would like to get 10%, but he wants to involve the Legislature to make sure that everybody is comfortable with getting to 10%.”
Williams wasn’t sold on the explanation.
Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia
“I feel as if that was said the night before, with 10% because there were cameras in the room, and everyone was talking about it,” he said after the meeting. “All of a sudden that changes.  I felt as if it was a disingenuous representation. It was like a bad dating profile.”
The state’s tax-cut trigger formula, passed by lawmakers in 2023, didn’t trigger a tax cut this year because West Virginia didn’t meet the revenue goal in this past fiscal year. 
Morrisey’s tax cut isn’t a done deal for lawmakers, who this week began vetting the governor’s proposed budget. A 5% tax cut would cost about $125 million; a 10% would equal around $250 million.
The governor and his budget office say the state can afford the tax cut, pointing to strong rainy day funds and general revenue numbers as a reason lawmakers can pass a tax cut. Changes to the Public Employees Insurance Agency plan have saved money, and finding “inefficiencies” in agencies’ spending helped too, they said.

Del. Michael Hite, R-Berkeley, said, “the math doesn’t make sense.”
“What happened between last year and this year that we have overcome a $400 million structural deficit in the out years, and we can afford a 10% personal income tax cut?” Hite asked.
A six-year plan, used as a budget forecasting tool put together by the Morrisey administration, projects a $204 million gap in fiscal 2028. Additionally, State Budget Director Mike McKown told lawmakers that looming federal cuts under President Donald Trump threaten the state’s budget health.
“You’re kidding ourselves if we think that we can make up for federal loss. Federal funds dwarf the general revenue funds,” McKown said.
There’s also budget pressures — the largest one being increasing the cost of the Hope Scholarship, the state’s education voucher program. The voucher will be available to all students for the first time next school year for an estimated price of $230 million — an increase of about $127 million in the coming fiscal year.
“The big one is fully funding the Hope Scholarship,” Revenue Secretary Eric Nelson told lawmakers.
Morrisey’s request for a pay raise for all state employees would cost around $78.4 million, and an increase for the employers of the PEIA is estimated to cost $35.1 million.
Williams said the projected budget gap in coming years along with decreased federal dollars coming into West Virginia are factors to consider as lawmakers weigh Morrisey’s tax cut proposal.
Morrisey’s budget request included a $13 million increase from last year to cover administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program after the Trump administration shifted more costs for the food aid program onto the state.
“Right now, to say a 5% cut, maybe a 10% cut, I don’t see how that’s fiscally responsible,” Williams said.
McKown told lawmakers that 2026 revenue collections are $128 million above estimate.
“We anticipate to end the year with a healthy surplus,” he said.
Nelson told lawmakers, “We all should be extremely proud of where we are right now.”
State agencies were asked to cut 2% this year, and Nelson told lawmakers that strategic cuts were estimated to save the state $120 million. 
Kelly Allen, executive director at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said in a statement that the budget presented by prioritized deeper tax cuts and paying for the Hope Scholarship, which opens up to all students next school year for an estimated price of $230 million. 
“He said himself these budget priorities will create hard decisions for many years to come, while his administration’s six year plan shows growing deficits in upcoming years that will strain our ability to invest in PEIA, health care, infrastructure and other needs,” Allen said.
West Virginia’s constitution requires that lawmakers pass a balanced budget.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)COLUMBIA — More than 550 people have been sickened with measles in three Upstate counties, the state health department said Friday.
The number of cases exploded in the beginning of the new year, with 148 reported in the past week. Since Jan. 7, the case count has more than doubled, according to the health department.
South Carolina has among the largest outbreaks in the nation, second only to Texas, which reported more than 800 cases in 2025.
Eight people have been hospitalized for complications of measles, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters. The state health department does not track cases after they are reported, so she did not give any more information about how they are doing or what type of care they received.
Travel and gatherings over the holiday season are the likely culprits for the spike in cases, she said.
When schools let out for winter break, health department officials struggled to track down unvaccinated students to let them know they’d been exposed to the virus. They continued going out and seeing family, often without knowing they were infected, increasing the disease’s spread, Bell said.

More than 180 students at 10 schools were in quarantine as of Friday, according to the Department of Public Health. For the first time since the outbreak began in October, that includes schools outside of Spartanburg County, the epicenter of the outbreak.
At Crestview Elementary School in Greenville County, 22 students are in quarantine. And Starr Elementary School in rural Anderson County reported a measles case this week, causing 10 students to quarantine.
Vaccination is the only sure way to prevent cases from continuing to spread, Bell said.
Most people receive two doses of the vaccine, which also covers mumps and rubella, during childhood. Anyone who is unvaccinated but wants protection from measles can get the shots at a doctor’s office or health clinic.
At least 87% of those diagnosed with measles during the outbreak are unvaccinated, according to the health department. The agency has not been able to determine a vaccination status for another 56.
“This is a disappointment, to see these now hundreds of cases that a majority of them could have been prevented, and we have an opportunity to prevent further cases if people can adopt available tools and help us stop this outbreak sooner rather than later,” Bell told reporters this week.
Measles can cause dangerous complications, especially for children, who make up the majority of those sickened during the outbreak. Symptoms typically start with a fever, followed by a rash that often begins on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. In severe cases, measles can cause pneumonia or brain swelling, which can sometimes be fatal.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/measles-vaccine-1024x719.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A push in the Kansas Legislature for greater transparency in the way Kansas Supreme Court Justices are selected furthers a revolt against the current merit-based system.
An attorney and Republican legislator teamed up to introduce Senate Bill 299, which would force the Kansas Supreme Court Nominating Commission to make public most of its records, including information on candidates for the commission.
Current Supreme Court rules dictate that all nominating commission records be confidential, but the commission has discretion to release judicial applicants’ names, employment history, educational background and home cities. A nine-member nominating commission selects three candidates based on merit, and the governor appoints a justice from the list of three.
Joshua Ney, an attorney who sits on the 2nd Judicial District’s nominating commission, was the lone proponent who testified Thursday to the Senate Federal and State Affairs Committee.
To him, the Supreme Court nominating commission “sure looks like a smoke-filled room.”
The commission is still subject to public meeting laws and has historically released information on its three selected candidates upon sending them to the governor. The commission’s interviews with hopefuls are also open to the public before members select their three nominees. But Ney took issue with the commission refusing to release the names and information of candidates for commission seats, including the chairman.
Ney said he helped brainstorm the bill, which Republican committee chair Sen. Mike Thompson of Shawnee introduced last April on Ney’s behalf.
“I don’t see a reason for secrecy in nominating commission proceedings,” Ney said. “I don’t see a parallel in any other public office where you can’t get the name of who else has filed for the office you’re considering filing — or someone else is considering filing for — ʼtil afterwards.”
Ney filed last spring to be considered for a vacancy on the nominating commission, he said in written testimony. He and his former law firm partner, Ryan Kriegshauser, who was recently appointed to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Kansas, repeatedly pressed appellate court clerk Doug Shima for explanations as to why candidate records were exempt from disclosure, according to emails from March included in Ney’s testimony. Shima repeatedly cited Supreme Court rules and existing law, stating he, as secretary of the commission for the past decade, does not release candidates’ names until the nomination process is closed.
The nominating commission consists of one attorney and one non-attorney from each of Kansas’ four Congressional districts, and one attorney chair. The chairman and two members from the 4th Congressional District were appointed last year, and the terms of two members representing the 1st Congressional District will expire in 2026. Lawyers are appointed to the commission by their peers, and the governor appoints non-lawyer members.
No one publicly opposed the bill.
If the House and Senate both pass the bill, and the governor signs it into law, it would go into effect July 1, around one month before voters are scheduled to weigh in on a proposed constitutional amendment to change the way Supreme Court justices are selected.
Voters will have the option on Aug. 6 of retaining the current merit-based system, or voters can choose to switch to a popular vote system, involving ballot races for a seat on the bench and public-facing campaigns.
If voters choose the popular vote system, the proposed records rule would have to be repealed entirely or significantly modified in subsequent legislation, said Jason Long, a legislative researcher and adviser, during testimony.
The issue is layered, with Democrats advocating for retaining the existing system and many Republicans arguing for a popular vote. Some have added the context that motivations for changing the system could be rooted in dissatisfaction among Republican leadership with Kansas Supreme Court decisions on education and abortion.
Former Chief Justice Marla Luckert announced earlier this month her intention to retire by February, and selecting a replacement is likely to be a monthslong process. Luckert began her time on the bench in 2003 after she was appointed by Republican Gov. Bill Graves. Her retirement will be outgoing Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s fifth appointment to the court, resulting in four sitting justices out of seven on the bench.
Lisa Taylor, a spokesperson for the Kansas Supreme Court, declined to comment on Ney’s allegations and the merits of legislation, citing an inability to discuss policy issues.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/senator-Thompsonb-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake City topped national charts this week under a blanket of the dirtiest air in the country, with more to come. 
Tuesday’s air quality ranked worst in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service. The Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s three-day forecast projects conditions will remain “unhealthy for sensitive groups” through Sunday. 
The Salt Lake Valley’s unique geography, encircled by the Wasatch and Oquirrh mountains, creates an inversion – where cold valley air traps pollution and harmful particles in the valley under a layer of warmer air at higher elevations. Low-pressure weather conditions, including strong storms, are needed to clear an inversion. 
Downtown Salt Lake City is shrouded in a thick pollution haze on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)
An average Utah winter has “about five to six multi-day inversion episodes on average,” according to the Utah DEQ, and 18 days with high levels of harmful inhalable matter, PM2.5. A longer high-pressure weather system creates more extreme conditions, prolonging the inversion. 
Salt Lake City recommends taking public transit, driving less and reducing idle times to limit contributing to the smog. Transportation contributes almost 50% of wintertime particulate pollution, according to the city’s sustainability website. Solid fuel burning is prohibited during periods of poor air quality.
Health impacts
A Nov. 2020 study from Brigham Young University found air pollution in Utah can decrease median life expectancy by 1.1 to 3.6 years, causing between 2,500 and 8,000 premature deaths each year. Exposure to dirty air increases risk of heart attack, asthma, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
The study also found risk of “stroke, cancer, reproductive harm to mothers and children, mental illness, behavioral dysfunction, immune disease, autism” all increase with prolonged exposure to poor air.

Everyone is vulnerable to negative health effects after exposure to high pollution, according to University of Utah Health, but some populations face a higher risk. Older adults, children, pregnant women, people with underlying heart and lung conditions, and those who work outdoors face a higher risk of severe health complications. 
During times of high pollution, U. Health recommends staying hydrated, limiting outdoor activity, using protective masks outside (such as N95 or N99), and utilizing indoor air purification.
Economic Impacts
The same BYU study estimates Utah’s air pollution costs $1.9 billion annually, citing “healthcare expenses, damage to crops, and lost earning potential,” as well as indirect costs such as “loss of tourism, decreased growth, and regulatory burdens.”
BYU’s study notes that those loss assessments “are on the low end of national estimates, which range up to $9 billion a year for Utah.”

The state board appointed Walter Saunders to be county superintendent as of 4:01 p.m. Friday. 
Associate state superintendent Jeffrey Kelly said the Hancock County county’s financial shortfalls pose an immediate threat to the ongoing operation of schools.
“Hancock County Schools’ financial situation has escalated from a monitored concern to a fiscal emergency,” he told the school board. “As conditions deteriorated. The district formally requested emergency state aid to meet payroll obligations.”
Uriah Cummings, the state school financial operations officer, told the board that Hancock County had been getting state assistance for financial purposes for three consecutive years as of October. Prior to that, Cummings said, there was nothing to suggest the county had major financial problems.
The county board used funds from its career and technical center to make payroll in September, Cummings said. Those funds were returned to the center, he said.
The county has been operating with 140 more positions than what the county school aid formula called for, according to the state, an overage that costs the county school board about $10 million per year, Cummings told the school board. 
In addition, the school board had numerous construction projects going on, including sports-related projects and had overspent on a construction project at Weir High School by nearly $1 million. 
Those expenses come out to be about an $8 million increase in expenditures from fiscal year 2024 to 2025, he said. 
Enich asked state officials to keep the administration in place and allow officials to continue taking steps under the direction of the state school board. 
“I’m well aware that this has happened under my watch, but would like to add that what I estimate as being the decades-long problem was identified and eliminated under my watch,” Enich said. “And [we] want to be the first ones to fix it, with help and assistance of the Board of Education and any assistance that can be provided our way.”
The Hancock County school board fired Chief Financial Officer Joseph Campinelli in November, according to reporting by West Virginia MetroNews. 
Del. Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, told West Virginia MetroNews Talkline last week that the financial crisis was caused by mismanagement, a lack of accounting and a number of other issues. Student enrollment has declined in the county just as it has in other parts of the state, he said.
“The books were just wrong, likely just from gross incompetence,” McGeehan said. “Hopefully it’s nothing more than that.”
In the news release Friday, state school board president Paul Hardesty assured Hancock County teachers and school staff members they would be paid, despite concerns the school board can’t make payroll. 
“This board has to make some very tough decisions,” Hardesty said in the news release. “But we must operate within code while also protecting the children and taxpayers of our state. We have told our counties for several years that using one-time COVID money for personnel would lead to a day of reckoning. That day has come in Hancock County.”
The county assistant superintendent and the positions of any personnel serving at the will and pleasure of the county school superintendent will also be vacant as of Friday afternoon, according to the state school board. The assistant county superintendent position will stay vacation in order to conserve resources.
According to the state school board, Saunders has been the director of federal programs and assessment for Ohio County Schools for 10 years. Saunders is an Air Force veteran with an undergraduate degree in mathematics education from West Liberty University and a graduate degree in educational leadership from West Virginia University.
“We are grateful for the service of Mr. Saunders, and we look forward to supporting him and his team to address the crisis in Hancock County,” Blatt said in the news release. “We appreciate the work of the WVBE and know that together, we will resolve the challenges and protect the students and education community of the county.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office confirmed it has opened an investigation into State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha over her removal and later return of part of an art display at the Nebraska Capitol.
Sheriff Terry Wagner told the Lincoln Journal Star on Friday that an investigator had been assigned to review evidence related to the incident and conduct interviews. He said his office was looking into whether the incident might fit the definitions of theft, criminal mischief or disturbing the peace.

On the first day of this year’s legislative session, Cavanaugh, a progressive lawmaker in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, removed several frames of artwork in the hallway near her legislative office. The art depicted moments and figures of American history from conservative nonprofit PragerU.
Cavanaugh said she did so because “we are not allowed to adhere anything to walls in the hallway of the Capitol.” She said any such display would typically be placed near the information desk and not in the Capitol’s hallways.
The patrol returned the posters to the Nebraska Capitol Commission, which Speaker John Arch said had approved the display’s use of the walls. The frames were returned to their spots the same day.
The incident got amplified by conservative influencers and media outlets after Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, tweeted security footage of the incident and wrote that he was “disappointed in this shameful and selfish bad example.”
Cavanaugh apologized last week as State Sen. Jared Storm of David City asked the Legislature’s Executive Board to reprimand her.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, which handles internal issues of discipline, said the board had discussed the incident at least once. He said he expects the board will advance some formal action against Cavanaugh, but they are waiting to see what the Sheriff’s Office does first.
On Wednesday, Pillen released a statement saying he consulted with law enforcement and legislators, and he “concluded this warrants a criminal investigation by law enforcement.” Pillen said he told the Nebraska State Patrol to refer the materials from the incident to the sheriff’s office.
Wagner told the Journal Star he was surprised to receive the call Wednesday evening and said this may be the first time his office has ever investigated a state senator.
Hansen said he felt the governor was “not unjustified” to call for the investigation considering the nature of the incident.
Cavanaugh declined to comment on the investigation Friday.

According to some reports, explosions were heard in Caracas and other cities near airports and military bases around 2 a.m. (Photo by Jesus Vargas/Getty Images)This week provided more proof that Congress — and our two Kansas senators — are unwilling to check the powers of President Donald Trump. 
A vote in the Senate on Wednesday could have blocked Trump’s ability to conduct further military action in Venezuela without congressional approval. Since Jan. 3, the U.S. has staged a military intervention, removed the president and claimed power over the country’s oil industry. 
The vote narrowly failed, 51-50. 
We are looking at you, Kansas Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall. 
Kansans might dispute how consequential this vote was, especially compared with other opportunities to slow down Trump. Both senators could have voted against other measures that have inched us closer to an imperial presidency. For instance, both sided with Trump during impeachment votes in his first term. 
Kansans might also argue that the vote on Venezuela was less significant than congressional action on domestic policies, such as deployments of the National Guard or widespread raids by immigration officials. The Kansas senators could have stood up when Trump asserted those powers. (In fact, they still can.) 
Nevertheless, the Venezuela vote is useful as a timely litmus test for Moran and Marshall, both as Republicans and surrogates for their constituents. Wednesday’s vote shows where they sit after almost one year of Trump’s second term. That is to say, on the sidelines. 
To understand this, let’s inspect the conservative coalitions on this vote. Republican ranks broke down into three camps. 
In the first group — let’s call them the Principled Objectors — there were three Republican senators: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Beginning last week, they broke unexpectedly from their party to force the Venezuela roll call vote and stuck by their convictions in the face of public and private threats from Trump. 
Marshall and Moran joining this group would require an extraordinary upgrade to their courage and wild swings to their ideologies. Both have long-term voting records that support the conservative cause. Perhaps it’s fantasy (or folly) to expect this level of resistance. 
In the second group — let’s call them the Equivocaters — there were two Republican senators: Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri. 
How do they earn the title of the Equivocaters? After first signaling their hopes of restraining the president, both waffled back to supporting Trump by voting with fellow conservatives. In doing so, they took a position of some courage before retreating, never fully committing themselves. 
We can associate them with equivocation in another way: They insisted on nothing more than weak language from the administration. 
From a statement by Young: “I’ve also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force.” 
Sounds like asking for congressional approval without actually mandating by legislation. 
Hawley said his assurance came from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 
If you are shaking your head at weak tea that the Equivocaters served, consider the posse that our Kansas senators joined — I call them the Compliant Coalition. Forty-eight Republican senators, including Moran and Marshall, helped Trump get his legislative wish this week with the Venezuelan vote. Vice President JD Vance was needed to break the tie. 
The Compliant Coalition appeases. It cedes power. It responds to threats. It holds its tongue. 
During Congressional votes. During campaigns. During election disputes. And during two Trump administrations. 
Lest the coalition say that they are simply representing the will of the American people, read the polls. According to an Associated Press poll this week, 61 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling foreign policy, in general. Only 35 percent believe this administration’s intervention has “been about right.” 
Recent polling from Reuters shows how divided and nervous Americans are about Venezuela. Polling from Jan. 4-5 shows Americans almost perfectly split on their approval of US military action to remove the nation’s leader Nicolás Maduro: 33 percent in support, 33 percent don’t know and 34 percent disapprove. 
Asked if they are concerned that the U.S. will get too involved in Venezuela, 72 percent said yes. 
These seem like the exact conditions when a robust Congress — and an empowered Kansas delegation — would want a say. The country is unsure and divided. Our president is volatile and threatening, while also vague about his military intentions. And the administration is pulling a U-turn from its first term, one that kicked off with an inaugural address trumpeting the wisdom of “America First.” 
If not now, if not on this issue, then when does Congress want power?
Perhaps these categories — the Principled Objectors, the Equivocators and the Compliant Coalition — are in flux. Maybe leadership will reel in the rogue Republicans. Maybe the Equivocators will develop further backbone when it comes to balance of powers. 
Or maybe — just maybe — a Republican from the heartland will assert Congressional power and grab the steering wheel. 
After all, we have at least three more years on this highway.

Chad Caldwell’s tagline last session when passing a one-year statewide cellphone ban in schools was “try it before you buy it.”
Now, Caldwell, R-Enid, and the law’s Senate author, Sen. Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, are ready to buy. Both have filed bills that would permanently ban student cellphone use during the school day.
“I think the reason we got to that is because it’s been clear from our educators and from our parents and communities that they want the state to buy it,” Caldwell said. “I think it’s been well received, and it just, to me, makes sense to make that change permanent.”
Caldwell and Seifried said they’ve received an overwhelmingly positive response to the policy, which bars students in public schools from using their cellphones from the morning bell until dismissal.

Under the current law, each school district will have the choice to continue the ban or make a change after the 2025-26 academic year.
Neither lawmaker said they worry many districts would reverse the policy once it becomes optional. Rather, Seifried attributed part of the success to the fact that “the state was the bad guy,” rather than local schools having to take criticism for requiring the ban.
“There is a part of me that (thinks), ‘Maybe having the law gives everyone the sort of cover that they need,’” she said. “There were a couple of conversations that I had that said it was so successful because everyone was all in it together. It was a collective decision. There was no option. It was state law.”
Educators and school leaders have told Oklahoma Voice the policy has had a positive impact by removing a major distraction and that families have been willing to comply because of the equal implementation statewide.
House Bill 3715 from Caldwell and Seifried’s Senate Bill 1719 would strike statutory language allowing local school boards the opportunity to change their district’s cellphone policy after the current academic year. Cellphones and non-school-issued personal electronic devices would be prohibited during the instructional day for “each school year thereafter.”
Both bills will be up for consideration once the 2026 legislative session begins Feb. 2.

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Mid-January marks the start of the legislative season, with the 30-day finance-focused session set to begin Jan. 20. Lawmakers and lobbyists will descend on the capital city to build the budget. But crucial election deadlines sit just around the corner. Candidates must declare by Feb. 3 if they wish to participate in New Mexico’s June 2 primary and Nov. 3 midterm elections.
Here’s an overview of campaign activity in the first few weeks of 2026.
Campaign finance and more in the U.S. Congressional races
New Mexico’s three members in the U.S. House of Representatives, all Democrats, each face challengers in the 2026 elections.
In Congressional District 1, which spans from Albuquerque east to Santa Rosa, incumbent Melanie Stansbury thus far will campaign against two Republican challengers: Steve Jones, a former accountant who’s run for congressional seats several times; and Ndidiamaka “Didi” Okpareke, a Rio Rancho pharmacist.
Gabe Vasquez represents Congressional District 2, which covers southern New Mexico along the border, up to the western part of the state and a slice of Albuquerque’s South Valley.
Democratic Socialist Tom Wakely, an Air Force veteran and peace activist in Deming who ran an unsuccessful 2024 campaign as a Green Party member for the U.S. Senate, is challenging Vasquez in the Democratic primary.
So far three Republican challengers have thrown in their names for the swing district (Vasquez held on to his seat in 2024 against a challenge from its former representative, Republican Yvette Herrell).
Those Republican candidates are: Eddy Aragon, a conservative talk radio host and former Albuquerque mayoral candidate; Greg Cunningham, marine veteran, former detective and two-time state legislative candidate; and Jose Orozco, a former contractor with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and unsuccessful two-time state representative candidate.
Congressional District 3, which spans the state’s northern half and runs along a stretch of its eastern border, is represented by incumbent Teresa Ledger Fernández. She is so far facing one challenger: Republican Rep. Martin Zamora, who was first elected as a state lawmaker in 2019.
In the U.S. Senate, no one has filed yet to challenge Democratic incumbent Ben Ray Luján, who has more than $3.1 million cash on hand, according to federal campaign documents. A “Toby Smith,” from the “Jewish/Christian National Party” — which has no online presence —  filed to run for the seat in October, but with erroneous information (such as using the address from Walter White’s “Breaking Bad” home). The Federal Election Commission already sent a notice to Smith that the filing did not contain a checking account for any campaign donations, which could open an audit or further enforcement.
Forward Party leaders say they’re moving… forward.
Leaders of the New Mexico arm of the Forward Party told Source NM this week they have gathered enough signatures to qualify as a minor party in the state, and also endorsed two Democratic candidates.

The Forward Party — founded by Democrat Andrew Yang after an unsuccessful bid in the 2020 presidential election and former Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey — posits itself as a centrist party focused on a return to civil politics and improving U.S. democracy.
The party is hosting a Southern New Mexico Town hall from noon to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Hotel Encanto in Las Cruces. The town hall will include two endorsed Democratic candidates: gubernatorial candidate for governor Ken Miyagishima, the former Las Cruces mayor; and Tilli Villalobos, a former federal prosecutor running for House District 37.
Deb Haaland announces education platform

Former U.S. Interior Secretary and U.S. Congresswoman Deb Haaland, who is running in the June 2 Democratic primary, promoted her ideas to bolster outdoor learning for K-12 kids, expanding trade pathways in middle schools, continuing universal pre-k and bilingual education and backed by chairs of the House and Senate Education committees, and Picuris Pueblo leadership.
Haaland said she will announce platform policies on affordability, health care and public safety  in the coming weeks. Other candidates in the race include Miyagishima and Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman.

Carrie Sorensen, a Portsmouth Democrat, speaks before the House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee about her bill seeking to provide diapers to parents on Medicaid. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A group of lawmakers led by state Rep. Carrie Sorensen wants New Hampshire to become the third U.S. state to cover the cost of diapers for infants under its Medicaid program.
House Bill 1798 would provide eligible families on Medicaid with funding for 100 diapers a month for the first 12 months of an infant’s life. If the bill became law, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services would have to submit a request — known as a Section 1115 waiver — to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to begin the program because Medicaid is run jointly by the state and federal governments.
In a fiscal note presented to the Legislature, state staff told lawmakers they anticipate roughly 3,600 infants will be eligible and take advantage of the service and put the cost of diapers at 46 cents each. Thus they estimate the program could cost the state $919,000 per year in addition to roughly $1.07 million that the federal government would provide annually for the program. For reference, New Hampshire’s entire Medicaid program is projected to spend $2.57 billion in the state’s fiscal year 2025 with 56% of that coming from the federal government. HB 1798 appropriates $100,000 a year for the program, but gives the governor the authority to pull more money as needed.
Sorensen, a Portsmouth Democrat and mother, framed the bill as a way to help new mothers with the financial burden of raising an infant. She noted that SNAP — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — doesn’t cover diapers and that new mothers are regularly facing high costs.
“I can personally attest to this,” she said. “You all heard my baby in the House last year.”
Sorensen argued low-income families are forced to ration diapers, which can lead to urinary tract infections and other medical complications from children not being changed often enough.
“Low-income parents have to make more difficult choices of whether they spend their money on diapers or whether they spend money on food or their heat or their rent,” she said. “Or do they ration diapers, risking their skin and their health? Neither choice is acceptable for a child’s well-being.”
Sorensen said she considered having her bill provide reusable diapers, but decided to go with disposable diapers because of the complications for families that use laundromats. 
In 2024, Delaware and Tennessee became the first states in the country to cover diapers under Medicaid after CMS approved their requests.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/diapersbill-1024x534.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Gino Bulso, a Brentwood Republican, is okay with first cousins getting married but not with same sex couples. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)New acquaintances, when finding out that I’m a journalist, often ask what beat I cover. 
My response is that as editor, I rarely write news stories but as the creator of a regular column, I choose to focus on the hypocrisy beat. 
God knows there’s no shortage of hypocritical behavior from Tennessee’s lawmakers and politicians, and I’m pretty sure I could churn out columns about it on a weekly basis. 
It’s still early in 2026, but in the last week, two lawmakers — one at the state level, one at the federal — showed they aren’t wasting any time indulging in hypocritical hijinks. 
Rep. Gino Bulso 
In first place for the Hypocrite of the Month is Rep. Gino Bulso, a Brentwood Republican. 
Two years ago, Bulso made headlines when he became the only member of the Tennessee House of Representatives to vote against a measure prohibiting marriage between first cousins. That Republicans and Democrats could agree on even something that seems like a no-brainer is rare in a chamber so deeply cloven by partisan division that it’s doubtful a proclamation recognizing Santa Claus would earn bipartisan support. 
Bulso gave an impassioned defense of the practice, informing his colleagues that his grandparents, who immigrated from Italy, were first cousins who came to Tennessee from Ohio because it was legal for them to marry in the Volunteer State. 
Stockard on the Stump: Bulso doubles down for first-cousin marriage

I’m not here to shame Bulso for his ancestors’ behavior: none of us can be held accountable for what previous generations did, and I’m certainly not privy to the social mores of small town Italy, from whence his grandparents immigrated, in the early 20th century. 
But Bulso has no shame about litigating and legislating how others should lead their lives, and with the legislative session just kicking off, he’s already filed three bills targeting LGBTQ+ Tennesseans. 
One measure, House Bill 1473, would render Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage the law of the land. Obergefell guaranteed the right through both the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process clauses and required states to perform and recognize same sex marriages. 
At the time in 2024 when Bulso took his stand for first cousin marriage, he made plain his view on same-sex marriage, saying that Obergefell “was a grievously wrong decision.” He also made the bizarre claim that the ruling should also protect marriage between cousins: if the 14th Amendment offers protections to same-sex couples, it should also offer the same protections to cousin couples, he said. 
Now, apparently, he sees no need to follow the Constitution at all and why should he? Failure to abide by the Constitution is all the rage among senior Republicans, chiefly President Donald Trump setting an example. 
Honorable mention: U.S. Rep. David Kustoff
I’ve subscribed to U.S. Rep. David Kustoff’s newsletters for several years, and he’s one of the state’s more reasonable congressmen, rarely making hay out of culture issues and typically focusing on community events and meetings.
But in his Sunday newsletter, he highlighted a recent appearance on Fox News. 
“I joined Rich Edson on Fox News Live to discuss the fraud in Minnesota. Governor Tim Walz has a lot of excuses. When it comes to waste and fraud, taxpayers deserve answers,” Kustoff wrote, referring to allegations of fraud in state social service programs.
First, the fraud is alleged. 
U.S. Rep. David Kustoff touting his appearance on Fox News. (Screenshot from Kustoff’s newsletter.)
But secondly, I feel sure there are already plenty of politicians on top of the Minnesota fraud investigations — clearly, it’s become a raison d’etre for the Trump administration, which has virtually occupied Minneapolis — and Walz, who, while not running for office again, surely does not want his legacy to be one of unchecked fraud. 
Perhaps, instead of devoting his energy to another state’s governor, Kustoff should turn his eyes toward Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. 
Of late, Lee declined to accept $84 million in federal funds for a summer food program for kids. All he had to do was have the state express their intent to take the funds — no application necessary — but for the second year in a row, he did not. And he provided no comment as to why. 
Mind you, Tennesseans are already paying federal taxes for this program, among the other programs our taxes cover. I’d call it fraud of a sort that we can’t reap benefits from the taxes we’ve paid, while other states are getting these federal dollars. 
Yet, I’ve heard not a peep from Kustoff, or other members of Tennessee’s federal delegation. 
Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers are fond of posting verses from the Bible on their social media feeds each Sunday, usually apropos of nothing. 
I know my Bible, too, so let me offer a verse that is apt for Bulso and Kustoff. 
The Book of Matthew, Chapter 7, verses 3-5 says, in the New King James translation: “And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?”
Or, to put in the Tennessee translation, don’t be such a dang hypocrite.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The University of Arkansas’ reversal of its offer to hire Emily Suski as its next law school dean has sparked concerns that the decision chills faculty’s free speech.
The university said it was withdrawing the offer after key Republicans raised concerns about Suski’s background and legal positions on transgender athletes.
The Fayetteville school is the latest to be embroiled in a debate over academic freedom as Republicans nationwide focus on college curricula. 
Here’s what to know about what’s happened at the UA:
 
Who is Emily Suski?
Suski is a professor and associate dean at University of South Carolina’s Joseph F. Rice School of Law. Her areas of expertise include education law, particularly Title IX and civil rights in public schools, according to her USC biography. 
She holds degrees from Georgetown University Law Center and the University of North Carolina. 
She’s spoken regularly in public and been quoted in multiple media outlets about Title IX. When she was hired, the UA praised Suski’s “extensive experience” in legal education and the practice of law.

Why did the university reverse course?
The university announced to law school faculty on Wednesday that it had changed its mind, saying it “decided to go a different direction in filling the vacancy.”
The university said it had heard from “key external stakeholders” before its abrupt decision. Though university officials haven’t identified those stakeholders, top Republicans have said they raised concerns about Suski.
 
What were Republicans’ complaints? 
Republicans who have said they were concerned about Suski include Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester and Attorney General Tim Griffin. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders hasn’t said whether she intervened, but released a statement applauding the university for its decision away from Suski.
Hester has said he objected to Suski signing on to a friend-of-the-court brief along with other law professors. The brief was on behalf of attorneys challenging laws prohibiting transgender athletes in school sports.
Hester also cited a 2022 letter Suski signed with other professors in support of Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden’s pick for the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
What has Suski said?
Suski has said she was disappointed by the university’s decision and the influence outside critics had. 
“I have been informed that the decision was not in any way a reflection of my qualifications to serve as dean, but rather the result of influence from external individuals,” Suski said in a statement released Thursday night. “Questions concerning that feedback are best directed to the University of Arkansas.”
 
What do critics of UA’s decision say?
The decision has prompted criticism from Democratic lawmakers and advocates around the country, who say it sends a dangerous message to professors.
An official with the American Association of University Professors called the university’s decision move “really chilling.” Other groups criticizing the move include the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
 
What happens next?
It’s unclear what the next moves are for the University of Arkansas and its search for a new law school dean. 
UA spokesperson John Thomas said, to his knowledge, nothing like this has happened at the law school previously. 
“Next steps for the search are still being determined. Beyond that, we have nothing further to add at this time,” Thomas said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260115_UALawSchool3_Grajeda-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Los legisladores progresistas y sus aliados en los sectores laboral y de la salud parecen tener la esperanza de que Newsom apoye una idea de financiación diferente y poco viable.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Los activistas de la atención médica de California, los sindicatos y los legisladores progresistas han instado al gobernador y a la Legislatura a encontrar nuevos fondos para financiar la atención médica y otros servicios sociales para millones de californianos de bajos ingresos y discapacitados.
 Su coalición, conocida como “Lucha por nuestra salud”, exigió el miércoles en las escaleras del Capitolio que la Legislatura y el gobernador Gavin Newsom, que pronto dejará el poder, tomen medidas para compensar los recortes de fondos que el presidente Donald Trump y los republicanos aprobaron el año pasado.
 El dilema sobre cómo responder a los miles de millones de dólares en recortes a los servicios sociales —en particular al presupuesto de Medi-Cal, el programa de Medicaid del estado de casi 200 mil millones de dólares— presagia un enfrentamiento que dominará tanto la sesión legislativa de 2026 como las elecciones de mitad de período.
 Mientras un sindicato impulsa una controvertida propuesta de ley sobre el impuesto al patrimonio para compensar los recortes, los demócratas progresistas en la Legislatura están proponiendo un impuesto corporativo independiente, aunque los detalles son escasos. Si esto se materializa en un proyecto de ley, es probable que también divida al partido, sensible a las acusaciones de que los californianos pagan impuestos excesivos y que recientemente ha declarado que sus líderes se centrarán en reducir los costos para los residentes del estado.
En su último año como gobernador, Newsom se enfrenta a un tira y afloja entre dos opciones políticamente costosas: aumentar los impuestos o permitir que caduquen los beneficios de millones de californianos de bajos ingresos y con discapacidad. Aunque su administración solo ha buscado culpar a Trump por los recortes federales, los activistas de la salud dejaron claro que presionarán a Newsom para que ayude a prevenir una pérdida drástica de la cobertura.
 “Quiero dirigirme al gobernador y a la Legislatura estatal”, dijo Judy Mark, presidenta de Disability Voices United, desde la escalinata del Capitolio. “Sabemos que ustedes no son responsables de estos terribles recortes, pero ahora la responsabilidad recae en sus manos. Tienen el poder de protegernos”.
El gobernador enfureció a los activistas de la salud al no incluir fondos para compensar por los recortes en su propuesta de presupuesto estatal , la cual reconoce que decenas de miles de personas perderán cobertura y considera menos servicios entre los ahorros proyectados. Este año, el estado comenzó a congelar las nuevas inscripciones a Medi-Cal para adultos inmigrantes indocumentados debido al aumento de los costos del programa, a pesar de las objeciones de progresistas y activistas.  
 Los analistas de Newsom prevén que unos 522,000 californianos perderán su cobertura de Medi-Cal en el año fiscal 2026-2027, cifra que aumentará a 1.8 millones en el futuro. Su administración ha afirmado que el estado simplemente no tiene los fondos para cubrir la cobertura de quienes sean excluidos del programa debido a las nuevas leyes federales.
Un sindicato, el Sindicato Internacional de Empleados de Servicios-Trabajadores de la Salud Unidos Oeste o  Service Employees International Union–United Healthcare Workers West, ha propuesto una iniciativa de ley que impondría un impuesto al patrimonio a los multimillonarios de California para ayudar a cubrir los aproximadamente 30 mil millones de dólares que el estado perdería anualmente debido a la ley de impuestos y gastos de Trump. Los promotores afirman que el impuesto único del 5% generaría unos 100 mil millones de dólares para el sistema de salud estatal. Aproximadamente el 10% de los fondos recaudados se reservaría para las escuelas públicas.
Pero Newsom se opone a la medida, que aún no ha sido aprobada para ser sometida a votación, pero que ya ha generado inquietud en Sacramento y Silicon Valley.

 Los multimillonarios son cruciales para el presupuesto estatal
La propuesta ha generado una oleada de oposición. Los fundadores de Google, Larry Page y Sergey Brin, supuestamente habrían intentado trasladar algunas entidades comerciales fuera de California, mientras que otras compañías amenazan con irse. Estrategas demócratas cercanos a Newsom están organizando un comité de campaña para derrotar la medida mientras el sindicato recopila las casi 900,000 firmas necesarias para que se presente en las elecciones de noviembre.
Newsom, quien se ha opuesto repetidamente a las propuestas estatales de impuesto al patrimonio, declaró esta semana a Politico que ha estado presionando personalmente a los promotores de la medida para que la abandonen, debido a la preocupación de que pueda llevar a los millonarios a  taxar a salir de California. Además, el gobernador mantiene vínculos personales de larga data con muchos de los gigantes tecnológicos que probablemente estarían sujetos a la propuesta de impuesto al patrimonio, y tiene motivos para mantenerlos cerca: son posibles donantes en caso de que se presente a la previsible candidatura presidencial tras finalizar su mandato como gobernador este año.
 Aunque los progresistas presionan a Newsom para que aumente los ingresos y refuerce Medi-Cal, pocos han apoyado la propuesta del impuesto al patrimonio, y la mayoría se mantiene expectante. Tampoco critican la oposición de Newsom, una posible señal de que los legisladores liberales esperan que esté dispuesto a buscar otros fondos para la atención médica.
El portavoz de Newsom, Izzy Gardon, se negó a comentar si el gobernador consideraría propuestas fiscales alternativas.
 Los defensores de la salud afirmaron que la sustitución de la financiación federal sería una prioridad clave en esta sesión legislativa. Los legisladores progresistas, que lideraron la oposición a la propuesta de Newsom de recortar costos congelando Medi-Cal para inmigrantes indocumentados , han señalado que también se sumarán a la lucha.
 La presidenta del Comité de Salud de la Asamblea, Mia Bonta , demócrata de Oakland, sugirió que el estado considere imponer nuevos impuestos a las corporaciones que emplean a trabajadores a quienes se les paga tan poco que califican para recibir asistencia de atención médica pública.
 “No podemos permitir que estas corporaciones sigan beneficiándose”, dijo. “California tiene la responsabilidad de actuar con decisión, y lo haremos”.
 Pero no ha presentado ningún proyecto de ley y los defensores de la atención sanitaria dicen que todavía esperan tener más opciones sobre la mesa.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01142026_-FightForOurHealthCoalition_RA_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Senate President Thomas Alexander, R-Walhalla, brought bags of the vapes confiscated from students to show senators. (File photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)As the South Carolina General Assembly reconvened this week, lawmakers did so in the wake of a major joint state and federal law enforcement operation that exposed the scale of illicit activity taking place in smoke shops across the state.
“Operation Ganjapreneur” resulted in the seizure of large quantities of illegal THC products and the arrest of multiple individuals on narcotics-related charges. More importantly, it revealed how
openly and routinely illegal products are being sold in communities across South Carolina, often with little consequence for retailers.
The operation underscored a troubling reality: many of the unregulated products sold in smoke shops are tied to broader illicit supply chains that strain law enforcement resources and pose real threats to public safety.
While federal law already prohibits many of these products, gaps in state law have limited the ability of local officers to act.
That enforcement gap has allowed an illicit vape market to flourish in plain sight.
Flavored disposable vapes are mass produced overseas, smuggled into the United States, and sold openly despite clear federal prohibitions. The result is a growing public health and safety crisis that state and local law enforcement currently lack the authority to fully address.
Roughly 90% of disposable vapes sold in the United States are manufactured in China, where they are banned for domestic sale. Many have been explicitly denied authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, a decision upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Yet anyone can walk into smoke shops across South Carolina and find rows of these illegal devices, marketed openly and aggressively to kids. This is not accidental. It is a business model built around exploiting enforcement loopholes.
The consequences are increasingly visible in communities across the state.
Nearly half of South Carolina teenagers now report using disposable vapes. Parents, teachers, and school administrators see the impact every day in classrooms, hallways, and parking lots.
Devices are disguised as pens, USB drives, toys, or school supplies. Flavors like cotton candy, bubblegum, and pink lemonade are designed to hook young users early. These products are sold with no testing, no oversight, and no accountability.
Despite these realities, enforcement remains limited. Federal agencies cannot police every storefront, and current state law does not clearly empower local law enforcement to remove illegal vapes from shelves or hold retailers accountable.
Without explicit authority, officers’ hands are tied, allowing bad actors to continue operating with near impunity.
Congress has recognized the scope of the problem and responded by allocating $200 million in federal funding specifically for illicit vape enforcement. Those resources are intended to support
states that align their laws with federal standards and partner in coordinated enforcement efforts.
For South Carolina to fully access those funds and participate in meaningful enforcement operations, state law must change.
Legislation currently under consideration, Senate Bill 287, would close this gap. The bill aligns state authority with federal law and gives the attorney general, as well as state and local law enforcement, the tools they need to identify illegal products, remove them from store shelves, and hold retailers accountable.
It passed the South Carolina Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support and rests on the floor of the House.
Opposition from some smoke shop operators has focused on claims of unfairness or economic harm. But that argument ignores a basic question: Why should any business be allowed to profit
from selling products that violate federal law and deliberately target children?
Enforcement does not punish lawful retailers. It protects communities, supports legitimate businesses, and restores order to a market that has spiraled out of control.
South Carolina now faces a clear choice. It can continue to allow illegal vapes to flood its communities, putting kids at risk and leaving law enforcement powerless. Or it can act decisively, align state law with federal standards through S.287, and shut down an illicit pipeline that has operated unchecked for far too long.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_8239-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

(Photo by Mike Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A former Senate Majority leader whose opposition to legalizing same sex marriage over a decade ago drew renewed scrutiny last summer is one of four attorneys Gov. Dan McKee nominated Friday to lifetime appointments to Rhode Island’s courts.
The nominees were made to fill vacancies in Superior, District and Family courts. Each will require vetting by the Rhode Island Senate, where chamber President Valarie Lawson said hearings are still being scheduled.
“Today, I am nominating four experienced judges to serve our state’s judicial system,” McKee said in a statement. “Each brings qualifications and perspectives that will contribute to the effective administration of justice in Rhode Island.”
The most high-profile name on the list is Michael McCaffrey, a Warwick Democrat who served as the Senate’s majority leader from 2017 through the end of the 2022 legislative session. A practicing lawyer since 1989, McCaffrey is a partner at his private practice in Warwick.
McCaffrey’s candidacy drew outrage from nearly a dozen speakers who testified against a potential appointment during his July 8 interview before the state’s Judicial Nominating Commission over his opposition to legalizing same-sex marriage in Rhode Island in 2013.
Judicial Nominating Commission forwards five names to McKee for District Court opening

During his July interview with the commission, McCaffrey said his understanding of such social issues “has evolved” and promised his past political influences would not impact any decision if he became a judge.
Lawson, who was first elected to the Senate in 2018, endorsed McCaffrey, saying he has “the highest integrity, a deep knowledge of the law, and a fair-minded demeanor that will serve our state well.”
“I had the honor of working alongside Michael McCaffrey in the Senate for several years,” she said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “He is a dedicated and distinguished public servant who is exceptionally well qualified for the District Court bench.”
If confirmed, McCaffrey would fill the District Court vacancy created by Melissa R. DuBose, who now serves as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The annual base salary for a District Court judge is $199,075.
Picked to fill a Providence County Superior Court opening made following Judge Daniel A. Procaccini’s retirement May 31 is Assistant Attorney General Shannon Signore. A graduate of the Roger Williams School of Law, Signore has worked for the AG’s Office since 2002 where she now works in its Special Victims Unit.
Signore was a 2016 Beau Biden Foundation Fellow and was recognized with the Crime Victim Service Award in 2019.
A Superior Court seat comes with a $205,567 base salary.
McKee is recommending two Family Court appointments to fill  vacancies left by the retirements of judges Debra E. DiSegna and Patricia K. Asquith last year.
Picked to fill DiSegna’s seat is Andrea Iannazzi, a graduate of Suffolk University who has served as a magistrate for the Family Court since 2017. McKee’s office notes Iannazzi previously worked as a staff lawyer and mediator in the Rhode Island Family Court system and served as Gov. Gina Raimondo’s deputy counsel and as counsel to her campaign.
She also served on the Cranston School Committee for a decade.
Magistrate Alberto Aponte Cardona Sr., was picked by McKee to replace Asquith. A U.S. Army veteran and 2004 graduate of the Roger Williams School of Law, Cardona was the first Latino appointed to the Family Court bench in 2019.
He is a former assistant city solicitor in Central Falls who has served on the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights and is an active member of the Blackstone Valley Advocacy Center’s board of directors.
Both Family Court seats come with a base salary of $205,567.

Listening to families, to health care providers and to experts. That principle guided my approach as an elected leader, and it guides my work with Immunize Colorado today.
Colorado recorded 36 measles cases in 2025, far exceeding the total number of cases from the previous decade. Five people have been hospitalized. Cases have appeared in 10 of our 64 counties, from Mesa County in the west to the Front Range. That may not seem like many, but for an infectious disease that can spread quickly, any uptick in numbers is cause for concern. In some of our rural communities, health officials worry the disease may be spreading undetected.

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but now we are at risk of losing that status. While it may feel like a technicality, this is an important indicator of the health of a country and how safe it is for children and families.
This is preventable. Vaccines are safe and effective and one of the best ways parents can protect their children.
Unfortunately, families today are receiving dangerous mixed signals about vaccines. In early January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Housing and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced it would be changing the childhood immunization schedule, reducing the number of diseases the CDC recommends vaccinating against from 17 to 11. This change was not because of new scientific evidence or eradication of diseases. It was against the recommendation of the health care community, and it will have serious impacts on generations of American children.
Families deserve better than this. Parents deserve accurate information from trusted sources, which should include our nation’s health agencies. Here’s what the evidence actually shows: Routine childhood vaccinations have prevented an estimated 508 million illnesses and over 1.1 million deaths among American children born between 1994 and 2023.
I talk with Colorado parents regularly, and I know what they want: real information to make the best decisions for their children. They trust their doctors and nurses to give them recommendations backed by science.
Elected leaders should be reinforcing that trust, not undermining it. They should be supporting the health care providers and local public health departments doing the hard work in communities across Colorado, and the country, not creating confusion that makes that work harder.
Colorado families are counting on our elected officials to put children over politics. That means following the science, listening to the experts, and speaking up for vaccine access.
We owe it to our children to keep them safe and healthy, and leaders, like our members of Congress, must do the same. Not staying silent while RFK Jr. creates confusion for Coloradans and our children pay the price.

Ilhan Omar helped organize a hearing including dozens of Democratic members of Congress on Friday, Jan. 16, in St. Paul to discuss the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Immigrants, activists and local politicians on Friday implored members of Congress to use their influence to stop the violent arrests conducted by federal immigration officers who have flooded Minnesota under President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda.
Dozens of members of Congress gathered in Minnesota to hear on-the-ground testimony and bear witness to how federal agents have menaced Minnesotans in recent weeks, especially Somalis and Latinos. But they also learned of how immigration agents’ actions have hardened Minnesotans’ resolve to fight for their constitutional rights.
Immigration raids are resulting in injuries, idling vehicles left in the streets, abandoned dogs wandering through neighborhoods and destruction of property, testifiers said. Agents are also scanning the streets for Minnesotans of color and asking for their papers.
“People are walking around on the street with their passports. That’s not American. That’s the furthest thing from it,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told the federal lawmakers. “Please take back to your respective constituencies and your colleagues the message of, if you love your own community, do not let this happen in ours.”
Friday’s hearing was not a formal hearing, but the sixth in a series conducted by U.S. House Democrats to highlight the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. The committee also invited both Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. No Republicans attended.
Newly elected St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Laos, told the committee that advisors recommended she carry her passport in case she gets stopped by federal agents. Her’s parents, who are U.S. citizens, are afraid to leave their homes for fear that their “neighbors would tell (federal agents) that that house was an Asian house.”
Trump has used fraud in Minnesota’s public programs to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community and justify sending 3,000 immigration agents to the state.
Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Minnesota, said many Somali Minnesotans are afraid to send their children to school, and elders are carrying immigration documents to their mosque.
“Do your job. Stand up for the Constitution of the American people. Our lives depend on it,” Hussein said.
Emilia Gonzalez Avalos, executive director of Unidos Minnesota, said the immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota have caused many to distrust the federal government.
“People should not have to worry that an encounter with a masked, armed federal agent could cost them their lives. This is not about whether immigration law exists. This is about how power is exercised,” Gonzalez Avalos said.
A lawsuit filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union alleges immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens. Minnesota and the Twin Cities are also suing the Trump administration to stop the immigration surge.
U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu of California encouraged Minnesotans to keep documenting the unlawful actions of federal agents and noted that the statute of limitations for violations of federal law is five years.
“While this administration may not hold anyone accountable, I guarantee you a future administration will,” Lieu said. “All of us are here today to let the people in Minnesota know that you are not alone, that the Constitution protects you and you are on the right side of history.”
In D.C., Congress is rushing to pass annual appropriations by the end of January to avoid another government shutdown.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan hinted that House Democrats may use the actions of federal agents in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, as leverage in the upcoming budget battle.
“We have passed policies to tell them not to do ICE actions in front of schools, health centers, funerals … but we still have violations,” Tlaib said. “When Speaker (Mike) Johnson says ICE is doing what it was created to do, remember this when the funding comes up next week.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ilhan--scaled-e1768590794467-1024x666.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Sheehan’s nomination is pending confirmation by the Delaware State Senate, and once approved, he would assume leadership of the State Board for the Redding Consortium decision.
DOVER, Del. Gov. Matt Meyer has nominated longtime education policy adviser Jon Sheehan to serve as president of the Delaware State Board of Education, positioning a veteran public servant to lead the board as it prepares to weigh a major school governance decision in northern New Castle County.
Sheehan’s nomination, announced Thursday, comes as the State Board of Education is expected in the coming months to review a pending redistricting proposal from the Redding Consortium, a multi-district body established under state law to recommend changes to school attendance boundaries.
The nomination requires confirmation by the Delaware State Senate.
“Jon Sheehan understands that strong public education is the foundation of a strong Delaware,” Meyer said in a statement. “He brings the rare combination of classroom experience, policy expertise and steady leadership that this role demands.”
Extensive education and policy background
Sheehan recently joined the University of Delaware’s Biden Institute as interim executive director. Before that, he served as senior adviser and deputy chief of staff for strategic operations in Meyer’s administration, working closely with cabinet agencies on education, workforce development and children’s policy.
He also served in a series of senior roles under former Gov. John Carney from 2017 to 2025, including education policy adviser, chief of policy and deputy chief of staff. During that time, Sheehan helped oversee implementation of Delaware’s Every Student Succeeds Act plan, coordinated education and childcare policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and advanced initiatives such as Pathways 2.0 and the Wilmington Learning Collaborative.
Earlier in his career, Sheehan worked for the New York City Department of Education in family and community engagement and began his professional career as a fifth-grade teacher.
Why the timing matters
The president of the State Board of Education is one of seven voting members but holds additional leadership responsibilities, including setting meeting agendas, presiding over hearings and guiding the board’s regulatory and appeals processes.
Those duties take on added significance as the board prepares to consider the Redding Consortium’s pending school boundary proposal. Under state law, once a consortium submits a plan, the State Board must vote to approve or reject it within a defined timeframe.
The issue has taken on heightened visibility after Meyer publicly called for acceptance of the Redding Consortium’s recommendation during remarks Monday at the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce’s annual dinner, signaling the administration’s position ahead of the board’s formal review.
If approved by the State Board, the proposal would advance to the General Assembly for consideration through a joint resolution and then to the governor for final action. If rejected, the board must issue written findings, and the consortium would have an opportunity to revise and resubmit its proposal.
As board president, Sheehan would oversee the review process, preside over the board’s vote and serve as the primary public spokesperson as the decision moves through the state approval process.
Reaction from education leaders
Monica Moriak, president of the Christina School District Board of Education, said Sheehan brings both experience and a collaborative approach to the role.
“Jon is an experienced policymaker who understands education and knows we must improve our education system,” Moriak said. “He’s open to ideas and input from others, and he’s a good leader.”
What’s next
Sheehan’s nomination is pending confirmation by the Delaware State Senate. If approved, he would assume leadership of the State Board during a period of heightened public attention to education policy, school funding and district governance across the state.
Sheehan holds a master’s degree in teaching from Fordham University and a bachelor’s degree in government from Wesleyan University. He has served on numerous state boards and commissions related to education, workforce development and technology.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1756045348080.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

It happened in Illinois in 2008, after then-governor Rod Blagojevich slashed $55 million from the state budget that was intended to fund substance abuse prevention programs and treatment centers. 
At the time, Howe was employed by the Illinois Association for Behavioral Health, a statewide organization that represents agencies that focus on prevention, treatment and recovery for addiction.

“I know of people who were thrown out of treatment who did not survive,” Howe said. “I saw it firsthand. I lived it and it was devastating.” 
Howe is currently chief executive officer of Addiction Professionals of North Carolina, a trade association for substance use professionals and providers. She spoke to NC Newsline just as the Trump administration reversed its sudden decision to terminate $2 billion in funding for drug addiction treatment and prevention programs.
The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) sent letters to service providers late Tuesday night, announcing that several critical federal grants supporting mental health and substance abuse prevention services were being terminated effective immediately “due to a shift in federal priorities.”
In North Carolina, the loss of the federal grants would have affected several programs funded by that money through the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS).
“It was eerily similar to what I saw and what I lived in Illinois,” Howe said. 
Howe’s organization receives funding through NCDHHS from one of the substance abuse prevention grants that was targeted for termination. She said it would have been “devastating” for service providers and patients. 
“It was really a wholesale decimation of the system, and I don’t say that lightly or hyperbolically,” Howe said. “When we started talking to our members, these grant terminations cut across every part of the system.”
Just as suddenly, SAMSHA sent a second letter Wednesday night reinstating the grants, but didn’t provide an explanation for the abrupt reversal. 
 “Your award will remain active under its original terms and conditions,” SAMHSA told service providers. “Please disregard the prior termination notice and continue program activities as outlined in your award agreement.”
The reversal came as a huge relief to Howe and other providers. But the chaos created by the federal move left many of them shaken and worried about the Trump administration’s commitment to their mission. 
“That’s a concern because the work we do directly saves lives,” she said. 
Howe said it forced service providers to consider tough decisions. “Providers in Illinois had to consider the same types of decisions that our providers were making yesterday,” she said. “Who do we lay off? What services do we close down? Who do we get rid of?” 
Cutting funding for drug treatment would impede the administration’s goal of stopping the flow of drugs into America, Howe said. 
“You can stop the supply all you want, but if you do not address demand, you’re not going to fix it,” Howe said. “Where there is demand, there is a supply. It’s street economic principles. I think we have to work hand in hand and recognize that we need both.”
Amy Brundle (Photo: NAMI NC)
Amy Brundle, director of marketing and communications for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) NC, said the decision to restore the $2 billion in grants was a welcome surprise. “But we really shouldn’t need to be having this conversation at all because these grants have already been approved by Congress,” Brundle said.
NAMI NC provides education and support programming to people with mental health disorders and their families. It also works to raise public awareness around mental health-related issues and how they impact people in North Carolina. 
Brundle said that “boots on the ground organizations” providing community support and direct service are meeting a need by helping to make sure that people are “alive and safe and able to function and thrive in society.”
The federal grant NAMI NC received was not targeted for termination, Brundle said, but many of the organizations the group works with would have been affected.
“Without them, I don’t really want to think too deeply about what the impacts would have been,” Brundle said. “We’re talking about catastrophic impacts over time.” 
NCDHHS grants that would have been impacted include: 

NC Healthy Transitions for Youth and Young Adults with Serious Mental Disorders
FY2023 Strategic Prevention Framework – Partnerships for Success for States (North Carolina)
North Carolina Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose-Related Deaths (PDO)
North Carolina Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs (SPF-Rx)  
NC System of Care Expansion: Focus on Governance Development and High-Fidelity Wraparound Program 

Brundle said the loss of federal funding for those programs would have created severe hardships for people with mental illnesses who rely on grant-funded health care providers for treatment.   
“Without these organizations being fully funded to do their work, there would be no community support for mental health, and not everything can be thrown back on the healthcare system,” Brundle said. “Organizations like ours exist for a reason.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/drugs_gettyimages-1004637310-1024x6271768496806-darwin_brandis__istock_getty_images_plus_720-1.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

(Photo by Ted Alcorn/NM In Depth).When the legislative session begins next week, Democratic lawmakers intend to revive a long-running effort to raise alcohol taxes as a means of reducing excessive drinking, which killed 1,755 New Mexicans in 2024, according to new Health Department estimates.
The latest proposal would create a new 3% sales tax on alcoholic beverages, according to one of the bill’s architects, Rep. Cristina Parajón, D-Albuquerque, while preserving the existing excise taxes that alcohol distributors are assessed based on the volume of alcohol they sell.
That is half the 6% levy Parajón and co-sponsors sought last session. “We think the proposal that we have this year is of the most reasonable,” she told the audience of a recent town hall meeting in Albuquerque.

For decades, excess drinking has been a top killer of working-age New Mexicans. In the latest estimates, a third of the deaths are attributable to acute causes like alcohol-fueled violence or vehicle crashes, and two-thirds are due to chronic causes such as liver disease and cancer.
New Mexico’s death rate declined 20% from a peak in 2021, according to the health department, but remains above pre-pandemic levels, underscoring an emergency which the state’s leaders have paid lip-service to but taken few steps to address.


Among the most effective ways of reducing demand for alcohol is increasing its price, according to public health experts, and raising alcohol taxes are the typical means of doing so. New Mexico’s existing alcohol taxes, which do not adjust for inflation, are at a 30-year low — between 4¢ and 7¢ per drink, depending on the type of beverage.In each legislative session since 2022, lawmakers have introduced bills to lift those rates. Each time, even as they have broadened their coalition and moderated their request, they have fallen short. Time and again, a wide spectrum of businesses that sell alcohol — from brewers to wholesalers to restaurants and even gas stations — has fought off the measures.In 2025, Parajón worked closely with Micaela Lara Cadena, D-Mesilla, vice chair of the House tax committee, but that is still where the bill died, after two Democrats voted against it.
The pair — Patricia Lundstrom, D-Gallup, and Doreen Gallegos, D-Las Cruces — both had ties to the alcohol industry and afterwards, Cadena took the unusual step of speaking out against what she perceived as her colleagues’ conflicts of interest.
During an interim committee hearing in October, Cadena seemed more determined, and said her duty as a lawmaker “is to our people, not to the alcohol lobbyist or industry or what they determine or decide.”
Lundstrom, on the other hand, remained unconvinced. McKinley County, which she represents and which has long struggled with high rates of alcohol dependency, is allowed to tax alcohol 5%, which she said was “a good thing.” But she was skeptical of imposing such measures statewide. “I’m not going to add more taxes on to McKinley County if I don’t see a clear path,” she said.
At last weekend’s town hall, when Parajón was asked whether the new bill had a better chance of passing the committee, she hedged. “I can’t really speak to how representatives are going to vote, especially when a new bill is brought forward.”
There is a precedent for adding a 3% sales tax: Maryland did exactly that 2011. In the years that followed, multiple studies found the change reduced alcohol–related harms.
At the town hall, another bill sponsor Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, D-Albuquerque, acknowledged the lawmakers had lowered their ambitions as they sought a bill they could pass. On a $2 beer at a convenience store, for example a 3% tax comes to little more than a nickel.
“How many of you would support paying five cents for a drink?” she asked the audience, who responded with a round of applause.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention long ranked New Mexico’s alcohol-related death rate the highest in the nation but it no longer does — because last year the Trump administration dissolved the agency’s alcohol unit, and disbanded its staff.
New Mexico Health Department communications coordinator David Barre said states were sharing data with each other to make such comparisons, “but it’s a work in progress.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/parajon-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Though some previous concerns have been raised about the number of attorneys that have cycled through the office since the former longtime Republican lawmaker took over the Attorney General’s Office in 2021, the finance compliance audit of Fiscal Years 2023 and 2024 raised concerns turnover was also high among the financial services staff, which oversees $184 million of revenue in motor vehicle license and permit revenue.
That turnover has led to errors and auditors found those years’ financial statements “continue to contain errors” and they said those “continue as a result of staff turnover in key positions.”
In fact, the report notes that while the Attorney General’s Office has undergone a number of reorganizations under Knudsen, the Centralized Services Division eliminated the Chief Financial Officer position. In addition to that, five of the eight positions in that division turned over in 2024, with the effects still reverberating in 2025, according to the audit report.
“Control deficiencies described in (four of the) recommendations are partially due to experience levels of current staff and a lack of use or documentation of internal controls,” the audit said.
The audit outlined how cash was misstated in various state accounts “due to inappropriate transfers and accrual errors. Those misstated totals varied from $4.5 million to $200,000 in three different funds during the course of three years. The audit report also noted that Knudsen’s office struggled with the same issues during the last audit period two years ago, and again four years ago.
The total amount of errors across all accounts was $21.9 million in accounting and transfer errors during the course of three years. The net result was an understated amount of cash in the general fund of $12.9 million during the course of that time, while cash in the state special revenue fund and the agency fund was overstated by $6.9 million and $1.3 million respectively.
While the Department of Justice agreed with the substance of the findings and vowed to improve internal controls, a Dec. 1 letter signed by Knudsen disputed the conclusions.
“We disagree that we did not have or do not have well-trained staff with strong institutional knowledge,” Knudsen wrote.
At a hearing before the Legislative Audit Committee, Chris Darragh, the lead auditor from the Legislative Audit Division, noted that the concerns about the financial audit came with an “umbrella” recommendation. Darragh told lawmakers that the problems with the financial audits all seemed to stem from the same two problems — inexperience of the staff and lack of properly written procedures.
“We’d suggest having a job map of what the responsibilities are,” Darragh said, as well as implementing more training.

Laura Kelly in a dispute about what state official had authority to initiate or intervene in court cases on the state's behalf. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The extraordinary power struggle between Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach and Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly about control of Kansas’ participation in lawsuits landed Friday in the lap of a short-handed Kansas Supreme Court.
The drama began in September, when Kobach sued Kelly over her refusal to disclose personal information to the U.S. government on 700,000 Kansas recipients of emergency food aid. Kobach’s case was tossed by a district court judge. In October, however, Kelly sued Kobach to reinforce her belief Kansas governors had authority to play a role in determining what lawsuits the state’s chief executive was attached to in court.
Kobach asserted he held near-exclusive control of the state’s interaction with the courts. Kelly took a contrary position, arguing the Kansas Constitution and state statute granted her a voice in those legal issues.
“The attorney general has a pretty good-sized sandbox. The governor has a sandbox too, but it’s not as big. He’s not content with just playing in his sandbox. He wants to play in her sandbox as well,” said Stephen McAllister, who argued before the Supreme Court on behalf of the governor.
McAllister, who is a former U.S. attorney for Kansas, urged the Supreme Court to issue a decision that directed the attorney general to stop interfering with the governor’s participation in litigation entwined in her official duties.
Kobach, who personally argued the case before the Supreme Court, said justices should recognize the Kansas Constitution, state law and court precedent made clear the state’s attorney general was in charge of representing the state’s interests.
“That’s what I was elected to do,” Kobach said. “We are maintaining that the governor has not been elected by the people to be our representative in court. She is the supreme executive, so she is in charge of all the executive departments under the governor, but she is not the state’s legal representative.”
Kobach said argument put forth by McAllister in defense of Kelly didn’t capture the reality of how a state government approached litigation.
“It’s like angels dancing on the head of a pin,” Kobach said. “They are trying to say, ‘Oh, but there’s a difference between representing the interests of my agency and representing the state of Kansas.’ Ninety-nine percent of the time, there is no difference.”
The Supreme Court agreed in November to expedite consideration of questions raised by Kelly v. Kobach. That opened the door to a resolution that avoided waiting for lower state courts to slog through the controversy.
Oral arguments in the case Friday were conducted with six justices rather than the normal seven, as retiring Justice Marla Luckert recused herself and wasn’t replaced temporarily. Chief Justice Eric Rosen, newly sworn in to that position, didn’t reveal when the state’s highest court would issue a decision.
In advance of oral arguments at the Judicial Center in Topeka, written briefs were filed by attorneys with Kobach and Kelly. Three other GOP statewide officeholders submitted their own brief to the justices, as did the Legislative Coordinating Council, which is dominated by House and Senate Republicans.
Justin Whitten, chief counsel for Kelly, said in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court that Kansas governors possessed authority within state law and constitutional authority to serve as the “supreme executive” of Kansas. Those duties, Whitten said, included determining the interests of Kansas agencies under her jurisdiction as governor. The attorney general lacked power to block a governor from participating in litigation that he or she believed had merit, Whitten said.
He said Kobach undermined his claim as the rightful arbitrator of the state’s role in lawsuits after repeatedly refusing Kelly’s request to bring or join cases in court.
“The governor’s limited goals in initiating this litigation are clear and simple. She is seeking this court’s confirmation of the powers the Kansas Constitution explicitly granted to her,” Whitten’s brief said.
In that document, Kelly said the attorney general misread state law “by conflating his legal duties with the governor and the Legislature’s power to determine the interests of the state.” It was folly for Kobach to claim it was important for the state to speak with one voice in appellate and federal courts, the governor’s lawyers said, because federal law recognized states could speak with more than one voice in federal court.
Kansas solicitor general Anthony Powell, in collaboration with Kobach, argued in a rebuttal brief that longstanding Kansas law “tethered to the Kansas Constitution, vest the attorney general with sole authority to represent the state in federal court.” In no way, Powell said, did executive power possessed by a Kansas governor allow Kelly to control or supplant Kobach.
Powell argued the attorney general’s position didn’t violate the Constitution, because that document established the attorney general as a “separately elected and independent officer,” whose powers were as broad as common law, except when modified by the Legislature.
“Governor Kelly’s argument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of our system of government,” Powell said. “But, despite her arguments in this matter, Governor Kelly is not the king.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kobach-at-supreme-court-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 13:57:25.467611
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 18:50:48+00:00,CT Mirror,"Many CT renters, homeowners spend too much on housing, report says",Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/ct-report-affordable-housing-partnership-strong-communities/,"The report says CT lacks enough affordable housing, with many people spending too much on rent or a mortgage and limited to living in cities.","Connecticut families are often spending too much on housing, don’t have sufficient choice in where they live and are often overcrowded into apartments, according to a housing data report released Friday.
The report from the Partnership for Strong Communities, a housing research and advocacy organization, says that although Connecticut is building more housing, particularly multifamily housing, than in past years, it would still take decades to meet the need if construction continued at the current rate. 
The report examines data on housing to paint a picture of the state of housing in 2025 across several factors including housing stability, affordability and choice.
“Connecticut needs to build more homes. We need to remove barriers that make housing feasible. We need to protect renters and homeowners from displacement,” said Chelsea Ross, executive director at the partnership.
A lack of housing — particularly housing that’s affordable to people with low incomes — has long been a problem in Connecticut, and the pandemic exacerbated those existing problems.
Half of Connecticut’s renters are paying more than a third of their income to housing costs, and about 1 in 4 rental households pay more than half their income to housing costs. The problem also exists for homeowners.
About a quarter of homeowners pay more than a third of their income to housing costs, and just over 10% pay more than half their income to housing costs. This means that Connecticut residents may struggle to pay other expenses such as electricity, health care or transportation costs.
“It’s always going to be one of the big topics constituents bring up, as long as it’s such a huge part of their budget,” said Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport. “It’s not at the 30% that people recommend. People have to choose between paying the rent or their electric bill or buying an adequate amount of groceries.”
People of color are disproportionately likely to be burdened by their housing costs, the report says.
The report notes that although state spending on housing has been high, particularly through bonding funds, construction isn’t keeping up with need. In 2024, developers built nearly 6,000 units of housing across the state.
But, the report says, estimates show that the state needs between 120,000 and 380,000 units of housing to meet the need. Thousands of units need to be designated affordable, according to the report. The idea is that building more housing will increase supply, reducing price increases because of heightened demand.
Connecticut residents also don’t have sufficient choice in where they live, according to the report. Most of the state’s rental housing is concentrated in urban areas while suburbs and rural areas typically have single-family housing. This means that for people who can’t afford a down payment on a home, they often have few housing options outside the cities.
It’s particularly hard for families to find housing because about 70% of all the state’s rental housing has two or fewer bedrooms, according to the report. The state also lacks “starter homes,” or smaller, cheaper homes for sale that have historically been a first real estate purchase.
The lack of housing also means that many families are overcrowded in small apartments, the report says.
“Where you can live in Connecticut is really constrained by zoning, our historical zoning policies, and it pushes up costs for everybody,” Ross said.
Experts have long tied the lack of multifamily housing to zoning practices that only allow single-family homes on the vast majority of Connecticut’s residential land.
Housing stability has also worsened for many families, according to the report. Homelessness has increased over the past few years. The report also found that about 35% of the people who called the state’s 211 system for help from November 2024 to November 2025 were looking for information about housing or shelter.
Ross said the number of affordable units needed — about 92,000 — doesn’t necessarily mean building that number of units, but that some existing units could be designated affordable. The state could also increase support for rental aid programs to help meet the need, she said.
The bottom line is that the state needs more housing, she said.
“Data is important, but what’s more important is that we do something,” she said. “A really great data report doesn’t alleviate someone’s housing instability. It doesn’t create stability for a family who needs to be in a community where their kids can access education, and they can be near their jobs.”
During the last legislative session, lawmakers passed a wide-ranging bill that addressed zoning, parking regulations and homelessness, among other topics. Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed that bill, then worked with municipal leaders to create a new bill that requires towns to create plans for how they’ll grow their housing stock.
That bill passed during a special session, and Lamont signed it into law in November.
Felipe said during the next session, which starts in February, he wants to expand on that work by focusing on housing stability for families. He wants to push a measure that would require landlords to provide a reason when they file for eviction. He also wants to find other ways to prevent homelessness, he said.
“We need to figure out how to mitigate the homelessness issue, do some prevention around it, and also make sure that renters aren’t taken out of their homes for small reasons,” Felipe said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hartford-Housing-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 13:57:25.467611

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Senate Democrats on Friday approved a controversial constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly to redraw the state’s congressional districts mid-decade, advancing a long-simmering proposal they say is necessary to protect Virginia voters from partisan map changes unfolding elsewhere in the country.
The Senate voted 21-18 along party lines, just three days after lawmakers convened for the 2026 session, to pass the redistricting amendment alongside three others dealing with  reproductive health rights, voting rights and marriage equality. 
All four measures had already cleared the House earlier this week, putting them on track for a statewide referendum this spring.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said Democrats brought the redistricting amendment reluctantly, but argued that developments outside Virginia left them little choice.
“What you have before you today is a constitutional amendment that none of us wanted to bring to the floor, but circumstances beyond our borders have made it necessary,” Surovell said. 
He framed the proposal as a response to “unprecedented mid-decade redistricting” in Republican-controlled states, warning that Virginia’s current system could amount to “unilateral disarmament” if left unchanged.
“We worked hard. We worked diligently to establish a fair bipartisan redistricting process,” Surovell said, referring to the 2020 constitutional amendment that created the Virginia Redistricting Commission. “But we don’t operate in a vacuum today.”
 Democrats cite temporary authority; Republicans warn of a return to gerrymandering

Under the resolution that passed Friday, the General Assembly would be granted limited authority to redraw congressional lines between Jan. 1, 2025, and Oct. 31, 2030, but only if another state conducts mid-decade redistricting for reasons other than the decennial census or a court order. 
Democrats emphasized that the authority would be temporary and narrowly tailored.
Republicans sharply disagreed, warning the amendment would unravel voter-approved protections against gerrymandering and open the door to broader map manipulation.
Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, argued that Democrats would not stop with congressional districts. 
“You’re going to redo the House of Congress. You’re going to redo the House of Delegates, and you’re gonna redo the state Senate,” Peake said. “We all know that is what is going to happen.”
Before the final vote, Democrats rejected an amendment offered by Sen. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, that would have required any new maps to be drawn by the bipartisan Redistricting Commission rather than the legislature itself.
Head urged lawmakers to remember the overwhelming support Virginians gave the commission just a few years ago. 
“Sixty-six percent of the voters of Virginia voted in favor of the constitutional amendment,” he said, calling the current proposal a reversal of a hard-won consensus against political gerrymandering.
Surovell dismissed Head’s proposal as a procedural “poison pill,” saying even minor changes would doom the amendment. “Virginia voters will decide whether they want to give us the power to take action or not,” he said.
Next, lawmakers plan to draw new congressional maps during a special session, with Democrats pledging to release the proposed districts publicly before they go before voters. The amendment would appear on the ballot in a referendum expected in April, rather than during November’s midterm elections.
Before either step can move forward, incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger must approve both the new maps and the decision to shift the referendum to April. A spokeswoman for Spanberger did not respond Friday to a request for comment.
 How the redistricting amendment took shape

The path to Virginia’s mid-decade redistricting amendment  began abruptly in late October, amid a rare fall special session and growing national anxiety among Democrats over congressional map changes in Republican-controlled states.
On Oct. 27 — just days before the Nov. 4 statewide elections — Democratic lawmakers signaled plans to pursue a constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly to redraw Virginia’s congressional districts outside the traditional post-census cycle. 
The proposal emerged during a special legislative session initially called to address budget matters but quickly became a flashpoint as Democrats framed the move as a defensive response to Republican-led redistricting efforts elsewhere in the country.
At the time, Democrats argued that Virginia’s existing constitutional framework — which limits redistricting to once every 10 years following the census — left the state vulnerable if other legislatures manipulated maps mid-decade. Republicans countered that the proposal was a transparent attempt to gain a political advantage ahead of closely contested federal elections.
Those tensions spilled onto the Senate floor the next day, as lawmakers clashed over both the timing and intent of the amendment. 
Republicans accused Democrats of exploiting a special session to fast-track a politically charged proposal with little public input, while Democrats maintained that the national landscape had changed rapidly enough to justify swift action. 
The debate underscored sharp disagreements over whether Virginia should proactively arm itself against potential federal court rulings or partisan map changes in other states.
Also on Oct. 28, House and Senate Democrats formally rolled out the language of the amendment, casting it as a counterweight to what they described as increasingly aggressive redistricting maneuvers by several Republican legislatures nationwide. 
The proposal would grant the General Assembly limited authority to redraw congressional districts mid-cycle, subject to voter approval, while preserving existing guardrails intended to prevent extreme gerrymandering.
The fight intensified the following day when the House of Delegates advanced the amendment in a last-minute push that drew fierce Republican criticism. 
GOP lawmakers argued the move violated norms around constitutional changes and accused Democrats of rushing the process to avoid scrutiny. 
Democrats, however, said urgency was warranted, citing looming federal elections and uncertainty over how redistricting battles in other states might reshape the national political map.
Despite the controversy, the amendment cleared another major hurdle on Oct. 31, when the Senate approved it in a party-line vote for the first time. 
Because constitutional amendments in Virginia must be approved in two separate legislative sessions with an intervening election, the proposal returned to the General Assembly when lawmakers convened for the 2026 regular session earlier this week.

Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota.
Congress is working through appropriations bills ahead of a Jan. 30 deadline to avoid a government shutdown. 
Rounds issued a statement Thursday lauding passage of bills to fund departments including Interior, which includes the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as Commerce, Energy and Justice.
Maybe, just maybe, there’s not another shutdown looming at the end of January

“Our ‘minibus’ appropriations package includes several wins for programs in South Dakota,” the Rounds statement said.
The Rounds press release laid out a series of earmarks in the three bills. Earmarks, also called congressionally direct spending, are one-time funding requests from members of Congress for projects in their districts.
Rounds listed $41.5 million worth of earmarks he secured for South Dakota:

$8.9 million for Oglala Sioux Tribe sanitation facilities.
$6.6 million for Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe sanitation facilities.
$20.3 million for Water Investment in Northern South Dakota (WINS).
$50,000 for the United States Army Corps of Engineers’ BIA Route 6 at Cherry Creek project.
$50,000 for the Corps’ Big Sioux Ecosystem Restoration and Cultural Resources project.
$50,000 for the Corps’ Little Bend and Counselor Creek Restoration and Resiliency project.
$50,000 for the Corps’ West Bend and Vicinity Restoration and Resiliency project.
$500,000 for the Corps’ Lower Big Sioux Watershed Comprehensive Study.
$3.9 million for upgrades to security equipment and technology at the existing jail and jail expansion for the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office.
$675,000 for technology upgrades and training for the Attorney General’s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
$343,000 for a project to monitor and forecast South Dakota air quality impacts from wildland fires at South Dakota State University.

Rounds said the legislation also includes “robust” funding for ongoing projects in South Dakota, and other South Dakota provisions. Among those are $418 million in total funding for infrastructure upgrades and scientific research projects at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, $17.5 million for the Mni Wiconi water project, a provision requiring a report on law enforcement staffing at Mount Rushmore National Memorial and a required briefing on timber harvest levels in the Black Hills.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 18:40:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The Trump administration favors natural gas. What does that mean for CT?,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/the-trump-administration-favors-natural-gas-what-does-that-mean-for-ct/,In some circles natural gas is viewed as the holy grail. In others it's a climate change nightmare. And then there’s everything in between.,"Doug Burgum, the U.S. Department of Interior secretary, said the quiet part out loud. 
It was a few days before Christmas, an hour or two after he had announced that five offshore wind projects under construction — including Connecticut’s Revolution Wind — was being halted “due to national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports.” 
Burgum told Fox News another story: “We have a solution in New England right there, which is natural gas from Pennsylvania, which would generate power five to 10 times more than all these … five projects put together.”
Natural gas.
In some circles it’s viewed as the holy grail of power supply. In others it is one of the worst climate change nightmares imaginable. And then there’s pretty much everything in between.
The U.S. produces more natural gas than any other nation. It also exports more. The Trump administration has clearly said it wants to do more of both. That was a pillar of President Donald Trump’s day one executive order, Unleashing American Energy, which put renewables like wind and solar on notice while creating a glide path for extracting and marketing more fossil fuels.
The general public has many mistaken notions about natural gas. That it is clean. That it will lower energy prices. Even that it occurs as a liquid like oil. And for sure that it is a panacea.
The misconceptions about natural gas extend to its economics and its politics. But they start with what it actually is, beginning with its name.
What’s in a name
Natural gas was given that name more than a century ago to differentiate it from the prevalent form of gas at the time, which was manufactured from coal. That gas was known as coal gas, town gas, coke gas, manufactured gas — among other names.
Natural gas, most often found alongside oil, came out of the ground as gas — so it was called “natural.” It came into wide use after World War II.
These days, some environmental advocates want to change the name to highlight its main component — methane.
“Typically I don’t call it natural gas,” said Deborah Gordon a senior principal at the energy think tank RMI, where she leads the oil and gas solutions initiative within the Climate Intelligence Program. She is an engineer with a deep background in energy and has written specifically on the myths and realities of natural gas.  
Underground, Gordon said, natural gas is anywhere from 60% to 90% methane. After it’s processed, the natural gas delivered via pipeline to New England is closer to 90% or more methane, she said.
Gordon is among many who point out that methane is a potent greenhouse gas. And the problems start well before it is burned as a fuel. The biggest of the problems is methane leaks into the atmosphere, Gordon and others say.
In the first 20 years after it is released, methane has more than 80 times the heat-trapping capacity of carbon dioxide, CO2, which is the most abundant greenhouse gas. After that, methane turns into carbon dioxide, at which point it adds to the long-term heat trapping and greenhouse gas buildup CO2 creates — some of which can last thousands of years.
The 2025 Global Methane Tracker report released in May by the International Energy Agency, IEA, stated: “Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term global warming and improving air quality.”
“The way we often talk about it is, CO2 building up in the atmosphere tells you how much warming the planet is ultimately going to experience over generations,” said Mark Brownstein, senior vice president of energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund, EDF. 
He previously worked for the electric and gas utility PSEG, which at one time owned the Bridgeport Harbor power plant.
“Methane in the atmosphere tells you something important about how fast the rate of increase is going to be,” he said. “Reducing methane from the oil and gas industry is the most immediate, impactful and cost-effective thing that we can do to slow the rate of climate change.”
Methane leaks when the gas is extracted, when it moves through pipelines and at many other points as it’s distributed to heat homes, pumped into power plants to generate electricity or super-cooled to convert it to liquefied natural gas for transport overseas by tanker.
Peter Raymond, a professor at the Yale School of the Environment who studies and measures global methane, said the biggest source of leaks is from waste — landfills and wastewater treatment facilities. Close behind are the natural gas leaks. Much farther behind is agricultural methane — mainly produced by ruminants, mostly cows.
“The biggest leak is in exploration,” Raymond said of natural gas leakage. “There’s considerable leaks in the distribution system that you can map and find. There’s efficiency to gain along the whole supply chain,” he said.
“Basically you don’t want it in the atmosphere at all because it has this very high potency over its short lifetime. Stopping it from leaking immediately stops that warming immediately,” said RMI’s Gordon. “CO2 builds up very slowly over time, and so stopping CO2 today, which we want to do, won’t remove all that has been built up over the last 100 years in the planet.”
Natural gas also contains standard pollutants — and those can leak, too. Gordon said they’re a mixture of everything the gas touched while it was underground, plus the volatile organic compounds methane, ethane, propane and butane. All of it can also contribute to smog.
“The whole thing is a combination of air pollution and greenhouse gas,” she said. “If the air pollution was your only issue, [gas] in fact would be a better choice than coal or oil, and it is less carbon intensive than coal or oil. So over the long term, it does have some marginal benefits relative to either one of those fuels. But when there are leaks, it does have this profound impact in the near term.” 
The extent of methane leaks from natural gas and its other sources also reflects local regulatory controls, including containment systems to minimize leaks and protocols to find and fix them. Brownstein at EDF said extraction around the Marcellus Shale — the area in the Appalachian Basin that extends through Pennsylvania into New York — has better controls than the Permian Basin, which is largely in west Texas.
He said a recent EDF report showed that emissions on the New Mexico side of the Permian Basin are half of what they are in Texas. “And why is that?” he said. “Because New Mexico has a regulatory framework in place that requires companies to manage their methane emissions, whereas in Texas, they don’t.
“The first question that I would have for anybody championing natural gas coming into Connecticut is, what has the state of Connecticut done to make sure that the methane emissions are managed well within the border?” he said. “And two, what is it that suppliers bringing gas into Connecticut should be doing to manage the methane footprint of the gas that they’re selling into the region?”
The American Gas Association, which says it represents more than 200 local energy delivery companies, claims on its website that “emissions from natural gas distribution systems have dropped 70% since 1990,” though it does not specify which emissions.
The site also lists among its commitments to “further reduce methane emissions from natural gas utility systems,” and it notes that AGA has put in place a reporting system for companies to document methane reduction actions. It also states that natural gas is “clean.”
AGA did not respond to questions about its actions or whether it supported the Trump administration delay of stricter methane emission standards.
Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, DEEP, has a pipeline safety group that monitors and manages leaks. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority regulates the gas distribution system within the state.
But all Connecticut’s gas comes from outside its borders, and that interstate movement is overseen by federal entities. 
“We don’t have jurisdiction to regulate those activities,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. Producers, she said, have been better about stemming leaks at the wellheads and production facilities. Lost gas is also lost money for them.
DEEP tracks methane emissions in its annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, which monitors the state’s progress towards its emissions goal. “While Connecticut has reduced fugitive emissions from older gas infrastructure by replacing older cast iron gas lines with newer PVC distribution lines, fugitive emissions have risen imperceptibly since the previous year,” its most recent report, released in September, stated.
Connecticut does not include the emissions that occur in the production of gas that eventually comes into the state. “This inventory does not capture the full effect of methane leaks into the atmosphere from the natural gas distribution system because natural gas consumed in Connecticut is produced and stored out of state,” the report also stated. New York, California and Washington do include that in their inventories.
“I think what keeps us up the most [at night] is that policymakers seem to be still reaching for gas as a solution for affordability, despite how much has changed to the contrary about the affordability of gas in the last 10 years,” said Jamie Dickerson, senior director of clean energy and climate programs at Acadia Center, a regional advocacy group for clean energy and climate change solutions.
He said even though the climate concern is still there, “we still are very concerned that natural gas would actually have an upward impact on energy prices and exacerbate the current affordability dynamics in the region.”
The counter-intuitive economics of natural gas
In certain policy circles, there has been no shortage of discussion, news stories and market analysis about the economics of Trump’s push for more U.S.-produced natural gas. And they all get at a similar idea — as gas production increases, so will the price for U.S. consumers. That may sound counterintuitive.
There are good reasons for it, though.
One is that even if all the gas was destined to be used in the U.S., producers would still need to drill, produce and transport it. Who would pay for that, including new pipelines and all the other construction components? U.S. consumers.
But a lot of the gas is not destined for use here. Much of the Trump administration’s motive for boosting production is to sell it to other countries — especially European countries trying to stop using Russian gas. They’ve been willing to pay relatively high prices, which gas producers certainly like.
If U.S. buyers want some of that gas, in order to be competitive they would to have to match those European prices. Even if you strip out the costs of liquefying it and transporting it to Europe, U.S. buyers would still face higher prices for natural gas, which seems to leave them stuck between a rock and a hard place.
The most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, EIA, shows how stark that price increase was in 2025 alone, despite an increase in gas production. Last year, the average wholesale spot price for the benchmark Henry Hub in Louisiana increased by 56% compared to 2024, when prices hit the lowest on record when adjusted for inflation. (Prices tend to be higher in winter than summer when gas is used for both electricity and heat.)
The average prices for the two hubs used by the Northeast — one in Boston and one in New York — doubled over that same period.
According to an analysis of EIA data done by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, there were record exports of natural gas — mainly as LNG — over the course of the first nine months of the Trump administration. They went up 22%. Costs for natural gas consumers also went up 22%.
January data from EIA predicts the benchmark natural gas price will decline in the beginning of this year, before rising sharply into 2027.
Michael Oristaglio, senior research scientist and lecturer in earth and planetary sciences at Yale University, and former director of the university’s energy studies program, said that could leave the oil industry in a bind. Since oil and gas often are a two-for-one drilling proposition — with oil prices too low for companies to want to invest and oil demand declining as well — drilling for more gas could go down with the oil ship.
“That is the issue in the Permian Basin,” he said. “The Marcellus is a little different. It’s one of the only shale formations that just produces natural gas.”
Compromising the ability to build new gas infrastructure is a shortage of natural gas turbines that is predicted to last until 2030. And even if the infrastructure could get built, tariffs might raise the cost — again, something that consumers would likely have to bear.
Even so, Connecticut is not ruling out a tilt back to natural gas use, despite years-long efforts to pivot away. 
Dykes said DEEP is researching the many factors around fossil fuel use, including the critical cost-benefit analysis, as it develops its next Integrated Resource Plan, IRP, which assesses future electric needs. While she noted that the cost of electricity is highly sensitive to the delivered price of natural gas in New England, she also referenced the marching orders from her boss.
“Gov. Lamont has been speaking for more than a year now about the importance of considering all energy options as a part of an all-of-the-above approach. And he’s been very interested in understanding what the potential benefits might be of expanding gas access, particularly to help make energy costs more affordable and make the grid more reliable,” she said.
At the opposite end, Dykes has to factor in how to meet the state’s decarbonization goals and mandates. She pointed to additional gas as a potential counter-balance to renewable power that may not be available 100% of the time. But she admitted that trying to weigh the many sudden moves by the Trump administration — such as the second shutdown and now court-ordered restart of construction on Revolution Wind — can make that process daunting.
“I think the only thing that anyone really can say with certainty is that the list of uncertainties continues to grow,” Dykes said. “Unfortunately, that doesn’t relieve us of the necessity of making some decisions and making some investments, with the best information we can, to help ensure that we have a reliable and affordable grid that can meet the long term policy goals that the legislature has set here in Connecticut.”
Brad Campbell, president of the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, CLF, and a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator, said that the conventional wisdom for many years was that if you wanted to lower electricity prices in New England, all you had to do was build more infrastructure to get more gas in. But he said that’s a misconception.
“Building more pipes isn’t going to reduce prices for New Englanders when the price of the commodity going into the pipe is going higher and higher,” he said. “Running another pipe — the gas industry expects that to be borne on the backs of ratepayers.”
Brownstein of EDF also pointed out that gas, unlike renewables such as wind and solar, comes with the ongoing cost of having to pay for every unit that’s consumed.
“When you say that a new gas pipeline will be run into New England, or you say that New England will build a whole bunch of new gas plants, ultimately you will pay for that every time you turn on your lights, and every time you turn on your stove,” he said. “It’s very nice for the Trump administration to say that you need all this and you should want it. It’s another thing to say to a homeowner in Connecticut, ‘Guess what you’re going to have to pay for.”’
Brownstein said in recent travels to Europe, he heard worries about the continent becoming too dependent on U.S. gas — namely, if energy prices begin to rise in the U.S., would the Trump administration restrict exports in order to keep energy prices in the U.S. low?
“They see that simply replacing their dependence on Russian gas for dependence on American gas may not be a smart bet either, particularly as the United States has become a less predictable ally,” Brownstein said.
Add to that the current dispute the U.S has with new E.U. regulations for monitoring and tightening methane emissions on oil and gas coming into the E.U. beginning next year. The U.S. has asked for an exemption. It’s unclear how that could play out — but it could push prices higher.
And there are also questions about how to move forward with existing gas infrastructure. Spend the money to repair it when needed? Replace it if necessary? Even expand it?
“We’re not doing the right cost-benefit analysis to determine where the public should be putting its money,” said Noah Berman, senior policy advocate and utility innovation program manager at Acadia Center.
That’s where politics comes in.
The politics of natural gas in the age of Trump
Connecticut has had its own love-hate political relationship with gas over the last 15 or so years. In 2013, in the state’s first Comprehensive Energy Strategy — developed by the then-new Department of Energy and Environmental Protection — converting to natural gas was a go-to strategy.
Its key goal was to take advantage of cheap prices from the fracking boom to convert more than 300,000 homes and businesses from oil to natural gas heat. Gas was touted as cleaner and a bridge fuel from oil to renewables. 
Climate advocates were incensed, predicting it would entrench gas for a generation or more. There were also concerns about the lack of pipeline capacity and the cost of building out infrastructure to distribute gas to homes.
While the policy stayed in place for years, the goals were never reached and it quietly vanished as the focus turned to electrification through heat pumps, rooftop solar and storage.
But much of the region did not look kindly on more gas lines or plants. A study done in Massachusetts 10 years ago found that more gas lines weren’t needed until at least 2030. While some gas generation was built, and oil-burning plants converted to gas, local opposition contributed to stopping others — including a plant planned in Killingly.

New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine are, to varying degrees, exploring what are referred to as “future of gas” policies — ways to wean states off using natural gas, from very gentle pushes towards heat pumps to strict rules barring new gas hookups for homes and businesses.
But with Trump’s pro-fossil fuel and anti-renewables policies in place, New York has delayed implementation of its gas bans that would have started on Jan. 1. The state’s governor, Kathy Hochul, is now considering allowing a gas pipeline to be built after years of opposing it. The concession is said to have been the price for restarting Empire Wind construction after the first time Trump ordered it stopped earlier in 2025, though Hochul claims that is not the case. (The project was one of those recently stopped again.)
Massachusetts has recently made moves towards backing off some its climate goals — though a longstanding ruling, which keeps utilities from charging customers for new gas lines, remains in place.
Connecticut has been on the sidelines for much of this — especially cutting back on gas use. Legislation that has promoted future of gas evaluations has failed more than once in recent years, and EIA data shows that gas consumption in the state is rising.
“Connecticut is an outlier on gas consumption rates among the rest of the region,” said Acadia’s Dickerson. “If you isolate just Connecticut, the rest of New England is actually flat or declining gas consumption over the past five to 10 years.” 
Acadia supports consideration of non-pipeline solutions — like promoting heat pumps, solar or geothermal energy — to avoid recommitting to natural gas when existing infrastructure has reached the end of its useful life or has safety issues.
The Trump administration has been steadily endeavoring to peel away safeguards against greenhouse gases as well as standard emissions of all sorts. It’s keeping coal plants open past their planned shutdowns. And the administration is close to rolling back more restrictive Biden administration standards for mercury and carbon emissions. 
For methane specifically, it has delayed until 2034 stricter emission standards also put in place by the Biden administration. A number of groups, including EDF, are challenging that in court.
“There’s no question that the Trump administration is working to put a thumb on the scale of oil and gas,” said Brownstein of EDF. “Doubling down on natural gas exacerbates a methane problem that they’re taking no action to solve, and, in fact, undoing work that the previous administration did that actually would have made a material difference.”
An open question is whether the Trump administration — through its energy emergency executive order, or any other energy actions including quid pro quos to restart offshore wind and other projects — will be able to force natural gas into or through a state that doesn’t want it.
On Jan. 13, the EPA announced a proposed rule to limit states’ ability under the Clean Water Act to deny federal permits for infrastructure like gas pipelines if the state feels they pose a hazard to water bodies. It follows a proposed rule issued in November that would remove federal pollution protections from many inland waters and most wetlands.
“They are absolutely trying to override state authority. And their theory is that anything states do that burdens the oil and gas industry — anything that burdens big oil and big gas — should be overridden because it interferes with the President’s authority in declaring the energy emergency,” Campbell at CLF said. 
“I think at the end of the day, the political pressure on governors to deliver on an affordability agenda is going to drive the same changes in policy, the same changes in the utility model and utility practice that we need to decarbonize the grid,” Campbell said. “But the one thing that seems certain is that deepening our addiction to natural gas for heat and electricity is going to only going to take us in a less affordable direction.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AIM-image1-Cromwell-CT.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

(Photo by Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bipartisan Kansas bill that aims to implement a bell-to-bell cellphone ban beginning next school year would override local rules and establish one of the nation’s most restrictive policies. 
The bill already has garnered a two-thirds supermajority of support from the Kansas Senate, as well as the support of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. 
Supporters of the bill say students would be mentally and physically safer, while opponents argue it’s an overreach of power that asks too much of students and schools. 
More than 20 people testified on Senate Bill 302 on Thursday before the Senate Education Committee, including Timothy Graham from the Kansas National Education Association, which represents 22,000 educators. 
“Our members are all over the place on this issue,” Graham said. “Understandably so.”
 
‘Problematic outcomes’
Ngoc Vuong, a school board member for Wichita Public Schools and a community psychology PhD candidate, told the committee he researches the academic effects of cellphones in schools.
“While multiple factors are responsible for causing and exacerbating the ongoing youth mental health, literacy, and numeracy crises, the evidence increasingly points to the advent and proliferation of a screen-based childhood, the immense power and influence of Big Tech companies over our society, culture, and education system, and the unhealthy relationships many children and adolescents have with smartphones and social media as central drivers of these problematic outcomes,” Vuong said. 
In his written testimony, Vuong linked cellphone use to poor academic performance, attention, executive functioning, sleep, and physical and mental health. 
Gretchen Shanahan, a parent from Overland Park, referenced a National Association of School Resource Officers statement supporting a bell-to-bell cellphone ban. 
“Access to phones during the school day reduces student safety in normal and especially emergency situations,” Shanahan said. “During an emergency such as a school shooting, students must be completely focused on lifesaving instructions. Phones can easily distract students from hearing, understanding and reacting appropriately — even when students use the phones to communicate with their parents.”
Kevin Cronister, a retired detective with the Internet Crimes against Children Task Force, said that based on his experience, a cellphone ban would mitigate the risk of predators contacting students. Cronister said predators often target students during the school day, when they are away from their parents, and may ask students to introduce them to classmates. 
Several proponents criticized the Kansas State Board of Education’s directive allowing each school district to craft its own policies around cellphone use, urging lawmakers to instead adopt a statewide ban.
 
District level decision
Cathy Hopkins and Beryl New, legislative liaisons for the Kansas State Board of Education, testified neutrally on the bill. They pointed to the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Screen Time in 2024 that led to the state board’s directive, and said districts that developed policies in collaboration with their community have seen the strongest results. 
Topeka Democrat Ann Mah, a former state representative, served on the board of education when it sent out the directive allowing for local control. 
“It should be clear that these discussions belong at (the district) level,” Mah said. “It should also be clear the Legislature has no role here. When you have school districts that range from fewer than one hundred students to more than 45,000 students, there is no way the Legislature can create a one-size-fits-all solution. 
“Besides that, I’m fairly certain that the 2,000 or so locally elected school board members are in a better position than you to make that call. What message are you sending your local board members? They likely already have a policy, but you think you know better? Seriously?” 
Kailey Howell, a senior at Spring Hill High School, said her cellphone has never distracted her from schoolwork. 
“While I understand that this is not the case for all students, I am confused as to why I am now having to bear the weight of consequences that were never meant for me,” Howell said. “Education has always been what students choose to make of it. Students with positive attitudes and a desire to learn will do so. Students who purposely avoid learning at every cost will not learn. Removing phones doesn’t change a student’s attitude. It only gives them another avenue to find another distraction.”
In his neutral testimony, Graham from the Kansas National Education Association — who also mentioned that teachers are divided on this bill — brought up the lack of funding. 
Multiple proponents acknowledged that schools would need dedicated storage for cellphones. Along with the storage, Graham said, districts would need to train staff, enforce compliance, and report to the state — all without additional funding. 
 
The big picture 
Eighteen states — including Washington, D.C., and the Virgin Islands — have banned cellphones and other wireless communication devices for the entire instructional day, the bell-to-bell policy. 
Neighboring Nebraska, Missouri and Oklahoma are part of that mix, and pushed similar bills forward last year. 
Preliminary data shows that strict school cellphone bans, like what’s being proposed in Kansas, have led to more more focused students, according to a University of Pennsylvania survey of 20,000 teachers. 
Florida was the first state to entirely ban cellphones in schools in 2023. A National Bureau of Economic Research paper found there was an adjustment period in 2024, the first year the ban took effect, with an increase in suspensions in the short-term — especially among Black students.

Free.,One year of Donald Trump: Alarms sound over relentless expansion of presidential powers,"Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/one-year-donald-trump-alarms-sound-over-relentless-expansion-presidential-powers,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump promised during his bid for another White House term that he would be a dictator only on “day one.”Before a town hall audience in Iowa in December 2023, Fox News host Sean Hannity asked Trump, “Under no circumstances, you are promising America tonight, you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody?”“Except for day one,” Trump responded, seconds later adding, “I want to close the border and I want to drill, drill, drill.”But a year since his inauguration, Trump has acted on some of his most extreme campaign hyperbole, and then some. A limited history of Trump’s expansion of presidential powers includes:The unilateral capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Máduro and deadly U.S. military strikes on suspected drug-running boats off that nation’s coast, as well as a threat to acquire Greenland.The targeting of Democratic-led cities with federal immigration agents — most recently Minneapolis — and National Guard troops.The threat to cut congressionally approved funding from institutions, including universities, that do not align with the administration’s ideology.The prosecution of political opponents and attacks on the free press.Those actions and others, coupled with a cooperative GOP Congress, have created an unprecedented shift away from the United States’ democratic tradition and founding principles that establish a system of checks and balances, States Newsroom was told in extensive interviews over recent months.Many congressional Democrats — and nearly half of Americans, in a recent poll — believe Trump has gone too far in his expansion of presidential power. Historians, political scientists and legal experts have sounded the alarm, with some saying the United States has reached authoritarianism, even as Trump has shown no signs of slowing down. Experts interviewed agreed that the United States finds itself in a “troubled moment,” as William Howell, dean of the School of Government and Policy at Johns Hopkins University, put it. “We've never seen a presidency that represents such an enduring threat to the health and well-being of our democracy as we do today,” said Howell, who recently co-authored the book “Trajectory of Power: The Rise of the Strongman Presidency.”Experts wary Ilya Somin, professor of law at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School and constitutional studies expert with the libertarian Cato Institute, said “I don't know that it is likely that we're going to slide into authoritarianism, but the very fact that the issue has to be raised is itself already bad.”“My hope, and to some extent my expectation, is that a combination of legal and political action will stop these abuses, or at least curb them, and to some extent, it has already. But, you know, how well the system withstands it remains to be seen,” Somin told States Newsroom.Others painted a more dire picture by pointing to the lack of such checks from the other branches of government.

Retired Army Col. David Graham, a senior fellow at the Georgetown Law Center’s Center on National Security, said Congress’ inability to block Trump’s military action in Venezuela shows that the president is operating with “unbridled” power.“This unbridled presidential authority represents what I consider to be a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States and to the global security of the international community,” Graham said.The Cato Institute’s Patrick Eddington offered: “It is absolutely noteworthy the speed and systematic nature (with) which Trump has been successful in literally gutting and reshaping to his will the domestic instruments of coercive power.” “I speak here about the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, in particular, but also successful in reshaping the military, the military leadership and the entire institution, to make it essentially as subservient as possible,” Eddington, the think tank’s senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties, and former senior policy adviser for Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., told States Newsroom.Doubts growing among AmericansPollsters also find voters are increasingly wary of Trump’s governing style.A recent Quinnipiac University poll found 70% believed the president needed authorization from Congress to go to war. The same day the poll was released, Jan. 14, the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate rejected a measure to require Trump to obtain permission before further operations in Venezuela.Bright Line Watch, a quarterly survey of the health of American democracy, has shown a decline in both expert and public opinion of how U.S. democracy has fared since Trump’s inauguration. The poll, conducted since 2017, surveys roughly 700 political science faculty at U.S. universities and 2,750 members of the general public.A Pew Research Center survey of 3,455 adults released in late September found 7 in 10 Americans believe Trump is trying to exert more presidential power than previous administrations. And overall, 49% of those surveyed said that Trump’s use of power compared to presidents past is bad for the country — though responses notably split along partisan lines.In response to an interview request for this story, White House spokesperson Liz Huston provided a one-sentence on-the-record written statement.“President Trump is making America greater than ever before for all Americans,” she wrote.Throughout its first year, the Trump White House has trumpeted its many policy victories, including conducting mass deportations, raising money through tariffs, extending tax cuts, cutting some federal spending and exerting influence over elite universities.Deploying the National Guard Throughout 2025, until the Supreme Court disallowed the practice days before New Year’s, Trump sent National Guard troops to a handful of cities led by elected Democrats. Depending on the city — Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Portland, Oregon; Memphis, Tennessee; and New Orleans  —  he rationalized the deployments as either to control crime or protect immigration operations and federal property.His critics, though, say those were pretexts meant to get Americans used to seeing military forces in U.S. cities, potentially to be deployed during the next federal elections.“It's really designed to lay the groundwork to normalize a militarization, essentially, of American civic life, as a prelude to using federal troops and National Guard troops, probably specifically for so-called election integrity operations,” Eddington said.  The deployments themselves, especially in California, Illinois and Oregon, where Democratic governors who usually control the state national guards vociferously objected to federal troops patrolling their cities, seemed to violate a founding U.S. principle against the military acting as a police force. The Supreme Court eventually ruled that the Chicago deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th-century law forbidding military forces from civilian law enforcement.

Trump’s use of military forces domestically is out of step with precedent, at least of the last 50 years, Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said.“The last nine presidents, not counting Trump I, we saw exactly two deployments to quell civil unrest or enforce the law,” she said. “Nine presidencies. Under President Trump, it's happened five times in the last four months. So this is not normal,"" said Goitein, who previously worked as counsel to former Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.Oregon Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley told States Newsroom the deployments marked one of the criteria of authoritarianism.“In order to anchor a strong-man state, you have to have the ability to put troops in the street,” he said.All night on the Senate floor Congressional Democrats, and in a few cases Republicans, have also protested Trump’s reach.Days after nationwide “No Kings"" day protests filled the streets on Oct. 18, Merkley led fellow Senate Democrats in an all-nighter on the Senate floor, speaking against what they described as Trump’s slide into authoritarianism. In mid-December, Merkley introduced a resolution “denouncing the horrors of authoritarianism.”Merkley has emerged as perhaps the leading Democrat focusing on Trump’s authoritarian tendencies. He’s made several closed-door presentations to his colleagues on the subject that includes urging them to look beyond the daily drumbeat of Trump news, he said.

“It’s one issue after another in this flood-the-zone undertaking, and it's easy to see the issue of the day and miss the big picture,” Merkley said in a Jan. 8 interview with States Newsroom. “And the big picture is a systematic implementation of an authoritarian strategy to create a strong-man state.” Merkley has branded Trump’s actions as authoritarianism, but said that is actually “weaker” language to describe it.“The stronger language is fascism,” he said. Speaking the day after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, Merkley said the agency’s mode of operating under Trump, as well as the deportation of hundreds to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, were fascism in action.“And when you see people with their faces covered, with no identifier of what military unit or police unit they belong to, it just says like, ‘Police.’ That's fascism. Grabbing people off the street without due process, preventing them from talking to a lawyer, shipping them overseas. That's fascism,” he said.Congressional Republicans who control the Senate and the House have paved a smooth path for Trump’s agenda.Despite a notable rebuke of Trump, in which a handful of Senate Republicans joined Democrats to advance legislation to curtail Trump’s unilateral military actions in Venezuela, the chamber eventually opted not to rein in the executive.Republican Sens. Todd Young of Indiana, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska split with their party in the Jan. 8 procedural vote to act as a check on the administration’s use of military forces — as did Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the measure’s co-sponsor with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. Trump swiftly responded on Truth Social that the five “should never be elected to office again.”The pressure campaign worked. In a followup vote less than a week later, Young and Hawley flipped and voted to block the measure.Five days prior to the procedural vote, U.S. special forces apprehended Maduro and his wife from their bedroom in the Venezuela capital of Caracas.Extra-judicial Caribbean killingsIn the months leading up to the operation, the Trump administration amassed roughly 15,000 troops and personnel, according to a figure cited in a U.S. Southern Command press article, and nearly a dozen warships in the region, including the largest U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, according to numerous media reports on the buildup. U.S. Southern Command declined to confirm specifics on “force posture.” Since September, U.S. warplanes have targeted numerous small boats off the coast of the South American country, killing more than 115 alleged “narco-terrorists” by the end of 2025, according to the U.S. Southern Command.By using the military, instead of police, to kill, instead of capture, suspected drug traffickers, Trump was subverting the rule of law, critics across the political spectrum said.Rep. Adam Smith, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, said, “Basically what the president has decided is that we are now going to have the death penalty for drug traffickers.” “But further, not only are we gonna have the death penalty, but Trump is going to be judge, jury and executioner. … That, again, is a massive expansion of presidential power,” Smith, a Washington state Democrat, told C-SPAN’s Washington Journal Dec. 19.Graham, a former staff judge advocate for U.S. Southern Command, said the alleged drug-running boats should have been treated as suspected criminals, not as enemy combatants akin to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. The alleged drug organizations involved did not constitute an “armed attack on the U.S. government,” he said.But the Trump administration wrongly expanded the definition of enemy combatants to include alleged drug organizations, rather than as alleged criminals, to circumvent laws governing police powers, he said. “If there exists no non-international armed conflict, and thus no applicable law of armed conflict, no unlawful combatants, no lawful targets, the U.S. personnel conducting these strikes. …  are simply engaged in extrajudicial killings,” he said.

Perhaps most troubling, Graham said, Trump told New York Times reporters in a Jan. 7 interview he did not “need” international law, and that the only restraint on his use of the U.S. military was his “own morality.”Venezuela is not the only country on Trump’s radar. The president told reporters as recently as Jan. 11 that the U.S. is going to take over Greenland “one way or the other.” Trump first mentioned buying Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark, during his first term. Now, in his second, the president has not ruled out the idea of taking the massive Arctic island by force. Quashing dissent Soon after Trump took the oath of office for the second time, he trained his focus on any dissent. Universities, media outlets and law firms were quickly in his crosshairs. The president demanded that in return for federal funding, access to government buildings and contracts, the institutions adhere to principles in line with the administration’s vision for America. The administration froze billions of federal research and grant dollars for Harvard University unless it changed its admissions and hiring policies, among other demands. The university won a First Amendment lawsuit against the administration in Massachusetts federal district court Sept. 3. Much of the funding was restored, according to Harvard Magazine, but the Trump administration appealed the decision in mid-December, again putting the nearly $2.2 billion in jeopardy. Other higher education institutions settled with Trump’s White House, including Columbia, which agreed to pay $200 million over three years to get its federal funding reinstated. “Universities that Trump considers to be liberal in their views are being punished. Journalists and media companies that don't toe the line (and) that are critical of Trump are being punished, directly or indirectly,” Goitein said. “Everywhere you look, you are seeing the targeting of people and institutions based on perceptions that they are politically opposed to the president,” Goitein said.In late September, Trump signed a memo directing law enforcement to prepare a national strategy to investigate “domestic terrorists” who are animated by “anti-fascism” as well as “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity.”Attacks on the free pressThe president has also homed in on news and entertainment media that don’t align with his vision.The Associated Press and the White House remain tangled up in court over press access after the wire service refused to use “Gulf of America” in its reports without noting that Trump had ordered a renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. The AP, a leader in editorial style, issued the same guidance for other news outlets. In response, the administration curtailed the AP’s access to press events in the Oval Office and on Air Force One. The Pentagon has also placed stipulations on press access. In October, dozens of reporters walked out of the building after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth gave journalists an ultimatum: either sign a pledge to only publish approved material or lose their press badges.Trump also requested Congress yank previously appropriated funds for public broadcasting stations around the country, including affiliates of National Public Radio and Public Broadcasting Service, which the administration said “fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda.” House and Senate lawmakers voted mostly along party lines to nix the funding in July.

Trump has also been exerting influence over network television, both news and entertainment operations.In September, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr threatened to revoke Disney-owned ABC’s affiliate licenses unless they pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from the air after the late-night host made comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Disney and ABC adhered to Carr’s demand but reinstated Kimmel a week later following public outcry.ABC News settled with the then president-elect in December 2024 for a $15 million charitable contribution to his future presidential library, and $1 million for legal fees. Trump had sued the network for defamation following a misstatement by “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos regarding a civil suit finding.In July, CBS’ parent company, Paramount, paid Trump $16 million after he sued over an edit in a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.Trump and his enemies Trump’s latest target among his political foes is Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The president has publicly pummeled Powell with threats to fire him if he did not rapidly lower interest rates.Powell learned Jan. 9 upon receiving a federal grand jury summons that the Department of Justice is probing whether he lied to Congress in June about renovation costs to the agency’s District of Columbia headquarters. Trump’s investigation of the Fed chair drew swift criticism as an overreach into independent monetary policy decisions meant to stabilize the economy.

Numerous former Fed chairs and White House economic officials who served under both parties issued a statement calling the investigation  “an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence.”The investigation revelation even roused Senate Republicans to question Trump’s actions. Retiring Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said in a statement he will oppose Trump’s forthcoming nominations to the Federal Reserve board of governors, including the Fed chair vacancy when Powell’s term expires.“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,” wrote Tillis, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee. Murkowski chalked up the investigation as “nothing more than an attempt at coercion.” Even Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told numerous reporters on Capitol Hill Jan. 12 that the allegations against Powell “better be real and they better be serious.”Trump had already exerted his influence over the central bank when he fired Board Governor Lisa Cook, appointed to the panel by President Joe Biden in 2023.

Trump hit setbacks in lower federal courts after Cook sued and retained her position. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on Jan. 21 on the question of the president’s power to fire independent agency appointees without cause. The justices heard a similar argument Dec. 8 over Trump’s firing of Federal Trade Commission appointee Rebecca Slaughter. The president has so far hit roadblocks in his other attempts to prosecute political opponents, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.A federal judge in Virginia dismissed Trump’s cases against Comey and James after finding U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi illegally appointed former special assistant and personal lawyer to the president, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Halligan secured a two-count indictment against the former FBI chief for allegedly lying to Congress over a leak to the press about the bureau’s investigation into whether Russia played a role in Trump’s first presidential campaign. Comey pleaded not guilty.The indictment followed the departure of Halligan’s predecessor, Erik Seibert, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who declined to seek charges against Comey.Halligan also secured an indictment against James, alleging bank fraud and that she lied to a financial institution to receive better loan terms. James also pleaded not guilty.James successfully prosecuted a massive fraud case in 2024 against Trump, his family and the Trump Organization, for falsely inflating asset values.In one particularly high-profile post on his own social media platform, Trump directly appealed to Bondi to prosecute Comey and James.“Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.He continued further down in the post: “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”Eddington described Trump’s actions as a “revenge tour” and said the president is “utilizing the coercive power of government, and in this particular case the Department of Justice, to go after his political enemies.”Then, the administration on Jan. 5  attempted to downgrade the military retirement rank and pay of Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat and retired Navy captain. Trump and Hegseth singled out Kelly after he and five fellow Democratic lawmakers, all veterans, published a video encouraging U.S. troops to refuse “illegal orders.”

In a barrage of Truth Social posts on the morning of Nov. 20, Trump wrote, “Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP??? President DJT” “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!,” he added a couple of hours later.The president reposted several messages from Truth Social users, including one with the handle @P78 who wrote, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!” The lawmakers published the video as the U.S. was nearly three months into its campaign of striking small boats off the coast of Venezuela.Alien Enemies ActThe president has also reached back as far as the late 18th century to invoke laws meant for extraordinary circumstances.In March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to bolster his mass deportation campaign and deport more than 100 Venezuelans, without due process, to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador. The wartime law, which had only been invoked during the War of 1812 and both world wars, gives the president power to deport people from nations with which the U.S. is at war.

Even when a federal judge issued an emergency order that the flights carrying men deported under the law turn back to the U.S., the Trump administration did not comply. As of Jan. 13, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was unlikely the men could be retrieved due to the chaotic situation in Venezuela, which the Trump administration caused.The Venezuelan nationals, ages 14 and up, many of whom the administration accused without evidence of being gang members, were incarcerated for months before being released to their home country in a prisoner exchange.   A federal appeals court has blocked Trump, for now, from using the law to quickly expel Venezuelan nationals. A full hearing is pending.Trump renamingTrump is also facing headwinds from Democrats and advocates for affixing his name to federal buildings and his face to this year’s national parks annual pass.Senate Democrats Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland joined independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont Jan. 13 to introduce what they’re calling the “SERVE Act,” short for “Stop Executive Renaming for Vanity and Ego Act.”

The lawmakers unveiled the bill less than a month after Trump announced his name would now appear on the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Trump was elected chair of the cultural center after he installed new board members early in his second term.Sanders said in a statement that Trump aimed “to create the myth of the ‘Great Leader’ by naming public buildings after himself — something that dictators have done throughout history.”Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, sued Trump in federal court on Dec. 22, alleging only Congress has the power to rename federal buildings.A public lands group has also challenged Trump in federal court, alleging he broke the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act when he replaced a national contest-winning photo of Glacier National Park with his image next to George Washington on the U.S. residents’ annual National Parks and Federal Recreation Lands Pass.‘The best job ever’Nearly a year after he took office, Trump again sat down with Hannity. In the Jan. 8 interview — the same day the administration sent more federal agents to Minneapolis in the face of intense protests and a day after the president said his own morality was the only restraint on his power — the Fox News host asked whether Republicans will win the upcoming midterm elections.“I think we've done a great job,” Trump said. “Maybe the best job ever in the first year.”Timeline graphic by Ashley Murray.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2026-01-16 13:57:25.467611

Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando made the remarks following a budget presentation by FDC Secretary Ricky Di[...]","Florida Channel screenshot of FDC Sec. Ricky Dixon on Oct. 15, 2025.Gov. Ron DeSantis is requesting the Legislature provide hundreds of millions of dollars for the Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) in his proposed fiscal year 2026-2027 budget, but a Democratic state senator says that is woefully inadequate.
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando made the remarks following a budget presentation by FDC Secretary Ricky Dixon before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice on Wednesday.
Specifically, FDC is asking for $374 million to raise base pay for corrections officers, probation officers, inspectors, and non-uniformed staff from $22 an hour to $28 an hour.
Dixon told the committee that it’s “the most significant pay increase I’ve seen in three decades in this business,” adding that it will “make a major impact” on retaining corrections officers, who often leave the department to work for other law enforcement agencies that pay higher wages.
But, citing a 2023 report that found that the state’s prison agency path was “unsustainable,” Smith acknowledged that Dixon can’t ask for more than what the governor is asking for, but that his agency needs more funding to survive.
“He needs much more … and he’s not able to ask for that,” he said, referencing the detailed blueprint by global consulting firm KPMG, which estimated the department needs between $6 billion and nearly $12 billion to repair buildings and construct new facilities, with hundreds of millions more needed to pay for staffing.
“That doesn’t  even include the cost of new dorms that are existing prison locations. It doesn’t include new construction for facilities to accommodate the growing prison population,” Smith said. 
“We have to remember as we are looking at this large request, rightfully so, that there are young 20-something year-olds with no experience who are watching over hundreds of men by themselves. Because they have no staff. We have a whole fleet of vehicles at the Department of Corrections that is way below the DMS [Department of Management Services] standard. They’re breaking down full of incarcerated people. That’s dangerous.”
Dixon told the same committee in November that Florida houses more than 89,000 inmates, a population that has increased by more than 10,000 since 2021. He added that the number is expected to rise by another 4,100 over the next three years.
“If we’re going to be a ‘tough on a crime state’, we have to understand what that means dollars and cents on the back end of being tough on crime, with an aging and overflowing prison population,” Smith added.
The governor’s proposed budget for the corrections system includes:

$56.7 million for an additional 500 full-time security positions.
$56 million to fund construction of new housing units.
$48 million for ongoing modernization of FDC’s data systems.
$18.8 million for critical security equipment such as body scanners and body-worn cameras.
$5.5 million to upgrade and replace aging state vehicles.
$3.5 million for expanding FDC’s intelligence capabilities using modern technologies that help officers and staff identify and eliminate contraband from the state prison system.
$3.3 million to replace radios, radio towers, and associated systems at multiple institutions.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-1-1024x570.png,,,2026-01-16 13:57:25.467611

The event, held at Thalia Mara Hall, allotted time for prayers and special remarks for Beth Israel. Jackson’s only Jewish congregation was a primary focus of the service after the early Saturday fire that destroyed part of the synagogue, which is the state’s largest.
Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, of Madison is facing federal and state arson charges in the attack.
“I wish I could say that this moment of our coming together in mourning and solidarity and hope and in friendship was unique, but unfortunately we have been here before,” Shemper said. 
“For us Jews, we have been here for literally thousands of years – between dark and light, hate and love, between being feared and accepted, between going and coming, between birth and destruction and rebuilding,” he said. “And we will always rebuild.”
Shemper told the story of a similar attack on Beth Israel in 1967, when the Klu Klux Klan bombed the building in retaliation for Rabbi Perry Nussbaum’s civil rights activism. In the aftermath, many non-Jewish people in the local community supported the synagogue and denounced the attack.

“Beth Israel is not brick and mortar,” said Russell, who spoke after Shemper. “Beth Israel is the people who gather, who pray, who learn, who argue, who care for one another. Wherever we gather, that is Beth Israel.”
Russell said the attack was meant to make members of Beth Israel feel like they didn’t belong, but the community has embraced them with love and solidarity.
“We are rebuilding trust. We are rebuilding connection. We are rebuilding with the knowledge that we do not do this work by ourselves,” he said.
To close, the rabbi offered a blessing to the crowd, who gave him a standing ovation.

After their remarks, the crowd huddled into small groups to pray for Beth Israel. 
The mayor and Derrick Johnson, national president and CEO of the NAACP, spoke before Shemper and Russell.
“It’s an indictment on our country, on our community, that there wasn’t a way for someone to stand in the gap, to turn him around, to make him inspired not to make that journey,” Horhn said of Pittman.
Horhn led the crowd in a prayer for a better Jackson, for healing and for the entire Jewish community.
“Help us build a Jackson that’s safer, that’s more respectful and more hopeful for everyone,” he said.

Johnson, who lives in Jackson, compared the fire at Beth Israel to similar hate-based attacks in El Paso, Texas; Louisville, Kentucky; and Pittsburgh. He said the common denominator between the attackers is that they were radicalized on social media platforms. 
Johnson also said people need to push back against the current political climate. He said this climate was “germinating directly from the White House,” to which one unknown attendee called out, “It’s not coming from the White House.” Johnson did not acknowledge the response.
“Under no circumstance should we allow political platforms to divide us for an agenda that has nothing to do with who we are and who we should be,” Johnson said. “We must learn from our history, not repeat it.”
The night began with worship songs and ended more prayers for the mayor, city and state officials, and for the state and city itself. At the end, faith groups were invited to adopt an area around their place of worship to do projects that would improve the community. The first workday will be Monday on Martin Luther King Jr Day.
If convicted on the state charge, Pittman’s sentence could be enhanced under a state law that punishes “offenses committed for discriminatory reasons.” The federal government did not immediately not charge him with a hate crime.

A federal affidavit alleges Pittman broke into Beth Israel early Saturday morning, doused the lobby with gasoline and set the building ablaze. 
The fire destroyed the library and administrative offices, two Torahs and the synagogue’s Tree of Life. Several other Torahs were damaged. One Torah that survived the Holocaust and was in a glass case remained unharmed. Beth Israel is accepting donations for rebuilding efforts.
Pittman was arrested at a hospital in Jackson, where he was being treated for burn injuries.
Authorities say Pittman confessed after being arrested that he targeted the synagogue for its “Jewish ties,” and called Beth Israel a “synagogue of Satan.”
Pittman was released from the hospital Wednesday and is in federal custody ahead of his preliminary hearing in federal court next Tuesday.
The attack drew national and international attention. State, local and national officials have condemned the arson and antisemitism. U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, has called on the FBI to investigate the incident as a hate crime.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 18:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"As temperatures dip, Bridgeport shelters struggle to meet the need",Reginald David,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/bridgeport-ct-shelters-cold-weather/,"While more CT households seek shelter each year, available shelter beds have declined, according to Opening Doors Fairfield County.","On cold winter nights in Bridgeport, dozens of unhoused residents line up outside the Alpha Community Services YMCA warming center because there are no shelter beds available elsewhere in the city.
When Connecticut activates a cold weather emergency, Bridgeport’s shelter system stretches beyond its limits. The warming center, Bridgeport’s only overnight option during extreme cold, opens at 7 p.m. and has space for just 30 cots. It operates on a first-come, first-served basis. On many nights, far more people arrive than the center is funded or designed to accommodate.
“We refuse to turn anyone away,” said Nicholas Hoffman, executive director of Alpha Community Services YMCA. “But we’re funded for 30 spaces, and many nights we’re serving 60 or 70 people. We collaborate with Prospect House a block up the road, which offers us some beds.” 
This winter, Connecticut has activated its cold weather protocol multiple times as temperatures dropped to dangerous levels across the state. While the protocol is intended to expand emergency shelter access, service providers in Bridgeport say the system is already operating beyond capacity.
Homelessness is increasing, while shelter space is shrinking.

According to Opening Doors Fairfield County, which coordinates homelessness response efforts across the region, the number of households seeking assistance increased by 24% from 2023 to 2024, while available shelter beds declined by 23%. From 2024 to 2025, the number of households needing help rose another 29%, while shelter capacity dropped by an additional 10%.
Homelessness across the state rose by 9.5% from 2024 to 2025, according to the state’s annual point-in-time count.
As a result, warming centers like the YMCA are functioning as full-scale shelters, despite not being designed, staffed, or funded to do so. Hoffman said the building, a former day care center owned by the city and repurposed years ago, was never designed to function as a full-scale shelter.
“We’re seeing the vulnerabilities of the infrastructure,” he said. “We need to feed people, provide hygiene, basic human needs. But we also have to ask bigger questions about how the system is structured and whether this is the right space or if services need to be spread across multiple providers.”
Gov. Ned Lamont last month assigned an additional $6.9 million for grants to organizations fighting homelessness and to maintain vouchers for supportive housing that were previously federally funded. The funds were part of the state’s $500 million emergency fund created to address the impact of cuts at the federal level. Connecticut has reported significant budget surpluses for years and has a healthy budget reserve.
But advocates say funding decisions at the state level aren’t helping enough.
Homelessness providers across the state are calling for an annual $5 million allocation for cold weather resources through proposed legislation. The funding would allow for more emergency beds, faster responses during extreme cold, and long-term planning, without requiring providers to reapply for emergency funds each winter, they say.
“It’s cold every winter in New England,” Hoffman said. “This shouldn’t be a yearly emergency.”
For people staying inside the shelters, the conditions can still be difficult.
Shirley Hurd, 68, said she became homeless after losing the house she was renting, which she believes was sold without proper notice.
“They sold the house I was in,” Hurd said. “I was paying. I had receipts. Then I had to go.”
Hurd said navigating shelter life is physically and emotionally exhausting, especially during the winter months. Overcrowding, limited bathroom access, and heightened tensions make survival more difficult.

“You’ve got almost 60 people and only two bathrooms,” she said. “People talk to you any kind of way. Some nights, there aren’t even beds and you just end up back outside.”
Frieda Brooks, 74, has lived in Bridgeport her entire life. Disabled and unhoused for more than three years, Brooks said she lost her housing after her son was shot and killed.
“I’ve lost a lot,” Brooks said. “But I’m still hanging in there.”
Without a phone, Brooks relies on word of mouth to learn about available resources. She said churches and community organizations have helped her survive, but accessing information remains difficult.
“There is help out there,” she said. “You just have to find it the best way you can.”
Epi Carrera, who has been unhoused since December 2023, said the YMCA warming center has been critical to his survival during cold weather. Still, he said overcrowding and stress can create challenges.
“When it gets really cold, people’s temperaments change,” Carrera said. “You’ve got different people, different cultures, different problems all in one space.”
Carrera said the solution requires more than emergency shelter.
“We need more beds,” he said. “We need more services, vocational help, and people who understand what folks here are dealing with.”
Inside the Alpha Community Services YMCA, staff and volunteers provide food, showers, hygiene supplies, and overnight supervision. By morning, they are exhausted, Hoffman said, but the focus remains on keeping people safe.
“This building was never meant to serve this many people overnight,” Hoffman said. “It’s not sustainable.”

The facility, owned by the city, operates as a community space and navigation hub for most of the year. During winter months, it becomes a warming center, a model Hoffman said exposes serious infrastructure limitations, particularly as the number of families and seniors experiencing homelessness continues to rise.
“Our space is funded and designed for single adults,” Hoffman said. “Families and seniors need more room and more support. What we’re doing right now is a temporary fix.”
The warming center is scheduled to close March 31. Service providers warn that without changes to funding, infrastructure and coordination, next winter could be even more dangerous.
For people like Hurd, Brooks, and Carrera, the stakes are high.
“This is about survival,” Hurd said. “People shouldn’t have to freeze just because there’s no space.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0112_SR_HomelessnessBridgeport_037-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798
,DC,2026-01-16 17:53:46+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump threatens tariffs on Greenland, countries that oppose US takeover",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-threatens-tariffs-greenland-countries-oppose-us-takeover,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump threatened Friday to place tariffs on Greenland and any country that opposes his efforts to take over the Arctic island, as members of Congress from both political parties were in Europe to assure allied nations that lawmakers won’t go along with his plans. “I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland because we need Greenland for national security,” Trump said. “So I may do that.”Trump has been increasingly focused on acquiring Greenland during his second term in the Oval Office and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this month that “utilizing the U.S. Military is always an option at the Commander in Chief’s disposal.”Lawmakers not on boardRepublicans and Democrats in Congress have been skeptical or outright opposed to Trump’s aspirations for Greenland, a territory of Denmark, which is a NATO ally.Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine independent Sen. Angus King, co-chairs of the Senate Arctic Caucus, met with officials from Denmark this week to try to reassure the country’s leaders. King wrote in a statement after the meeting that “the Denmark and Greenland coalition reiterated to us that they are fully prepared to cooperate with the United States in any way to expand our national security presence in Greenland – an agreement which goes back 75 years.” “It was a very productive meeting and I'm hopeful that the administration will finally realize that taking Greenland over by a military force is almost unthinkable — to attack essentially a NATO ally,” King added. “That would be the greatest gift to (Russian President) Vladimir Putin that this country could possibly bestow.”Murkowski wrote that the “United States, Denmark and Greenland should be able to count on each other as partners in diplomacy and national security.”“Respect for the sovereignty of the people of Greenland should be non-negotiable, which is why I was grateful for the opportunity to engage in direct dialogue with Foreign Ministers from Denmark and Greenland,” Murkowski wrote. “Meetings like the one held today are integral to building stronger relationships with our allies that will continue to endure amid a shifting geopolitical landscape.”House speaker derides ‘media narrative’U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said during a press conference this week that he hasn’t heard any plans for military action in Greenland at any briefings he’s attended and that he believes “this is a media narrative that's been created.”Johnson said he doesn’t “anticipate any boots on the ground anywhere anytime soon,” though he added the United States does have national security and critical mineral interests in Greenland. “Greenland is of strategic importance, its geography and everything else. So look, again, you have to wait for that to play out. I'm going to leave it to the administration to articulate it how they will,” Johnson said. “But I think what the president is articulating is something that everybody objectively has to acknowledge, that Greenland has strategic significance to us and also to other countries around the world, so we need to play that very seriously.”A bipartisan congressional delegation was in Denmark on Friday to communicate to leaders of that country and Greenland that they don’t support Trump’s efforts. Lawmakers on the trip include Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, Murkowski, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, as well as Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean, Maryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer, California Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs, Delaware Democratic Rep. Sarah McBride and New York Democratic Rep.

[…]","Event Recap
On January 13, 2026, CommonWealth Beacon hosted a Zoom webinar with Executive Editor Michael Jonas to  discuss the submission and publication process for opinion pieces at Commonwealth Beacon.
The session included a presentation of best practices for submission, including a list of do’s and don’ts, and concluded with a call for questions from the audience.


Takeaways+
Do:

Have a clear point that can be captured in a single sentence and boiled down even further into a headline
Focus on something that is “in play” in Massachusetts
Write clearly so that a smart, but not expert, reader can follow your argument
State your main point early
Back that argument with facts, which can include a reasonable number of links

Don’t:

Submit a piece that is so broad it lacks a clear focus
Have as a focus a point that virtually no one would take issue with
Write for insiders who know the issue well (avoid “alphabet soup”)
Wait until the last paragraph to get to your point




Resources+





Q&A+


What word count range are you looking for?
Generally, 700–900 words (up to 1,000 is still in-range). That’s typically enough space to make a strong argument without losing readers. Online publishing allows flexibility, but writers should use as much space as needed—no more—and avoid filler or “throat clearing” before getting to the point.


Should writers stick to the word count when submitting, or write long and expect edits?
Stick to the word count unless you have a compelling reason it truly needs more. Submissions that are much longer create significant editing burden and can delay feedback. Aim for under 1,000 words unless you can make a strong case for exceeding that.


How long should contributors expect to wait for a response after submitting (even just an acknowledgment)?
With current staffing and submission volume, if we’re interested, you’ll typically hear back within about two weeks. Time-sensitive pieces may move faster, but contributors should assume their piece should still feel timely one to two weeks after submission.


Who is your readership, and do you run op-eds about pending legislation?
The audience is best described as Massachusetts’s “engaged citizenry”—not just Beacon Hill insiders, but people who pay more than average attention to state policy and civic life and are looking for substantive, “meaty” pieces. On pending bills: you can write about legislation, but the piece shouldn’t just be a call to pass Bill X. Use the bill as part of a broader argument about the issue and debate—avoid “contact your lawmaker and urge a yes vote” style advocacy language.


What scope of topics works best—Boston, Massachusetts, New England, federal?
Massachusetts-wide is the sweet spot (it’s in the name Commonwealth Beacon). Boston topics can run, but we’re mindful of the “Boston bubble” and aim for statewide relevance and balance. National/international issues are generally not the focus unless they’re clearly connected to Massachusetts.


Are you open to embedded media (photos, video, graphs)? And how many links are too many?
Yes—media can be welcome if it meaningfully strengthens understanding. For photos, contributors must ensure proper rights/permission to publish. For links: they can help readers dig deeper, but don’t overwhelm—there’s no magic number, but ~5–6 key links is a good target.


What topics do you wish more people would submit op-eds about?
We’d welcome more pieces on the economy, business, employment, higher education (we get many K–12-focused submissions, fewer higher ed pieces), local/municipal government issues—as long as the topic isn’t so town-specific it belongs only in a local outlet; it should be generalizable to broader statewide or multi-community challenges.


Is there a preference for solo vs. jointly written op-eds?
No preference—co-authored pieces are fine within reason. Three to four authors is pushing the outer edge; five to six starts to feel unwieldy and more like a coalition statement than a genuinely co-written op-ed.


Do you only want pieces about what’s “in play,” or can writers argue for issues being ignored (or bring history/analysis)?
“In play” should be taken broadly—a strong argument about an issue being ignored can be a great fit, including calling out Beacon Hill for neglecting it. We also welcome historical perspective and pieces that don’t fit the classic op-ed mold—more like an essay—as long as it’s compelling, well-written, and engaging (even if it’s not tied to a specific Massachusetts policy action).


Do you have a policy limiting how often a writer or organization can be published?
There is no formal rule, but we’re mindful of not running the same voices or organizations too frequently.


Do you prefer working with PR representatives or directly with authors?
We’re more inclined toward pieces that come directly from authors. PR-submitted pieces can raise questions about messaging or “spin,” though we do publish pieces that come through communications shops. Bottom line: you don’t need a PR intermediary—reach out directly.


If someone works with MassINC’s policy team, are there special guidelines for submitting to CommonWealth Beacon?
CommonWealth Beacon operates independently within MassINC (parallel tracks: journalism vs. research/policy). Having a relationship with the policy side doesn’t disqualify a submission, but it also doesn’t provide priority. Pieces that reference MassINC research are treated similarly to pieces drawing on other policy organizations’ work.


How are podcast topics decided, and do you accept pitches?
Yes, we welcome pitches for topics and guests. Don’t use the op-ed portal—email Michael Jonas, Laura Colarusso, or Jennifer Smith.


How long do op-eds stay in a prominent spot on the website? Do they get removed?
On the homepage, the opinion section has three slots; pieces get pushed down as new ones publish. We aim for one new opinion piece each weekday, so a piece typically stays featured for about three days. After that, it remains accessible via the opinion landing page and search—it doesn’t disappear and remains available long-term.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 12:57:44.537908

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota lawmakers on the the House Education Committee on Friday unanimously deferred action on a bill to more effectively remove violent children from public school classrooms on a temporary basis.
The bill was introduced at the request of the South Dakota Education Department and supported by Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration. It would authorize school districts to require students with “aggressive or violent behaviors” that disrupt school or endanger other students or employees to continue their public school education in an “alternative setting.”
The legislation would help plug a “leaking” workforce pipeline, Education Secretary Joe Graves said, since teachers are increasingly leaving the profession due to violent student behaviors. South Dakota is still recovering from a yearslong teacher shortage.
Lawmakers determined the bill was too brief and too vague. The legislation doesn’t lay out the process for the removal, time limitations or parental involvement. Nor does it define “alternative setting” or “aggressive or violent behaviors,” said Rep. Mike Stevens, R-Yankton.
“I’m not sure 37 words is going to plug this hole,” Stevens said.
In 2015, 7.5% of South Dakota teachers left the profession entirely, according to department data. In 2025, 17.3% left the profession. Graves said behavioral issues are the second leading cause of teachers leaving the profession, behind teacher pay.
Graves said children have thrown objects through windows, destroyed classrooms and smashed computers — increasingly at the elementary school level, and sometimes injuring educators.

Graves shared a message from an elementary school teacher, who said if they were a new teacher “no way I’d stick it out if this is what I’d deal with until retirement.”
Several lawmakers raised concerns about how removing a student from a classroom for violent behavior would impede their education. Graves told lawmakers it would harm the student’s education.
“It’s better for the other 20 kids who don’t have to face that violence and disruption,” Graves said.
Rob Monson, executive director for the School Administrators of South Dakota, told lawmakers that the bill could cause legal challenges and more costs for school districts. Other lobbyists raised concerns about responsibilities not outlined in the bill and capacity issues at existing alternative education options, such as Children’s Home Society in Rapid City and Sioux Falls.
Monson added that schools already use in-school suspension to separate children within a building. Superintendents can suspend students for up to 90 days. School boards can choose to expel students, which involves a hearing and investigation.
Graves said expulsion is a “little-used disciplinary tool.”
Lawmakers asked Graves to meet with them, education lobbyists and other stakeholders over the next few weeks to amend the bill and reintroduce it to the committee.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)More than 100 Twin Cities clergy gathered at the skyway entrance to Target’s downtown Minneapolis headquarters Thursday to sing, pray and demand the retailer take a stronger stand against federal law enforcement activity in the metro and prevent agents from using its properties as staging grounds.
“We are shopping elsewhere, we shall not be moved,” the group chanted. ISAIAH, a nonprofit coalition of Minnesota faith and community groups, organized the demonstration. 
By evening, the group said outgoing Target CEO Brian Cornell had agreed to meet with them Monday. But “there is no cause for celebration until Target leadership has leveraged their power and done their part to meaningfully protect their workers, their customers, and the communities in the state they call home,” they added.
Target management has kept a low profile since the Trump administration ramped up immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities last month. The company remained silent after video surfaced on Jan. 8 of federal agents arresting two Target employees at a Richfield store as a raucous crowd gathered around. Democratic-Farmer-Labor Rep. Michael Howard, who represents Richfield, later told media that the pair were U.S. citizens.
Last weekend, several carloads of federal agents — including U.S. Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino — descended on a Target in St. Paul. Bystander video showed agents standing guard outside the men’s room as shoppers heckled them. 
Target representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
Other big Minnesota employers have largely followed Target’s lead, remaining quiet even after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good on a south Minneapolis street last week. 
In addition to Target, the Reformer reached out to UnitedHealth Group, 3M, General Mills, Medtronic, U.S. Bank and the Minnesota Business Partnership, an advocacy group for the state’s largest private employers. None of the companies responded by press time. A representative for the Minnesota Business Partnership responded but did not provide any comment on the record.
“Corporate and political leaders are seriously underestimating how mad Minnesotans are about the ongoing federal attacks,” Jake Schwitzer, executive director of the Twin Cities-based progressive policy research firm Northstar Policy Action, said in an email.
The corporate heavies are confronting a nearly impossible choice: President Donald Trump is known to use his considerable power over tariffs and tax and regulatory enforcement to reward companies in his good graces and punish those that oppose him. Target, 3M and other big companies are especially vulnerable to tariff rates; UnitedHealth is facing federal scrutiny in a number of highly regulated business units. 
The companies are also still bruised from the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd, when many of them made significant commitments around diversity, equity and inclusion. The political winds shifted quickly, however, with right-wing media and consumers targeting companies that took up social justice goals. When Target reversed course on DEI after Trump’s election in 2024, the company faced another backlash and boycott, this time from progressives. 
The federal law enforcement surge has already significantly disrupted Minnesota’s economy, Schwitzer said in an analysis posted Wednesday.  Immigrants account for about 1 in 12 Minnesota residents but roughly 1in 9 of its workers, meaning actions that compromise their safety and freedom of movement disproportionately affect business activity in the state, he said. 
Roughly 4 in 5 businesses along key commercial corridors in Minneapolis and St. Paul have closed during the past week as employees lay low, and revenue is down nearly across the board, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported Tuesday. Immigration raids at suburban construction sites have disrupted homebuilding activity in the region, according to Twin Cities Business.

“Right now, many businesses in Minnesota are seeing fewer customers and struggling to staff shifts,” Richard Trent, executive director of Main Street Action, said in a statement Wednesday. “Owners need their employees to feel safe coming to work and their customers to feel comfortable walking through the door.”
Trent’s group represents about 1,500 small businesses in Minnesota.
In an interview, Howard said he has been engaging privately with Target leadership for weeks. Though he declined to characterize the substance of those conversations, he said Target and other large employers should follow the lead of smaller businesses and “take a stronger stance” to assert their rights as private enterprises.
“There are things that some businesses have done … that we think all businesses should do as a matter of practice,” Howard said.
He said those measures could include putting up signs saying immigration agents aren’t welcome without judicial warrants; more clearly communicating with customers about how they engage with federal authorities; and implementing “training protocols to protect their workers and staff.”
Howard acknowledged that big, well-known companies may be reluctant to speak out against an administration that has shown itself to be “vindictive” toward critics, corporate or otherwise. Trump’s Justice Department has investigated, indicted or attempted to indict individual critics like former FBI director James Comey, New York attorney general Letitia James and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, among many others.
“It’s corporate culture, in general, that where businesses can stay silent and out of the public frame, that is the default,” Howard said.
But he added that taking a stronger stance may be the right move from a business standpoint. The ISAIAH demonstration suggested a backlash could be building against brands seen as timid or out of step with a public that recent polls show is broadly opposed to heavy-handed federal policing.

A judge in Milwaukee brought a 13-year quest for justice by a grieving father to a close on Thursday, accepting a plea deal for two men charged criminally for their role in the killing of his teenaged son.
Robert W. Beringer and Jesse R. Cole pleaded guilty to felony murder under a deferred prosecution agreement that allows them to avoid jail time yet publicly stand accountable for their actions leading to the 2012 death of Corey Stingley. The men helped restrain the 16-year-old inside a convenience store after an attempted shoplifting incident involving $12 worth of alcohol.
“What happened to Corey Stingley should have never happened. His death was unnecessary, brutal and devastating,” Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne told the judge in a letter filed with the court.
Both of Stingley’s parents spoke directly to the judge in an hourlong hearing in a courtroom filled with family members, community activists, spiritual leaders and some of the teen’s former classmates.
“Corey was my baby. A mother is not supposed to bury her child,” Alicia Stingley told the judge. She spoke of the grace of forgiveness, and after the hearing she hugged Beringer. The Stingleys’ surviving son, Cameron, shook both men’s hands.
The agreement requires Cole and Beringer to make a one-time $500 donation each to a charitable organization of the Stingley family’s choosing in honor of Corey. After six months, if the two men comply with the terms and do not commit any crimes, the prosecution will dismiss the case, according to documents filed with the court.
ProPublica, in a 2023 story, reexamined the incident, the legal presumptions, the background of the men and Stingley’s father’s relentless legal campaign to bring the men into court. The three men previously had defended their actions as justified and necessary to deal with an emergency as they held Stingley while waiting for police to arrive.
Ozanne, who was appointed in 2022 to review the case, recommended the agreement after the two men and the Stingley family engaged in an extensive restorative justice process, in which they sat face to face, under the supervision of a retired judge, and shared their thoughts and feelings. Ozanne said in the letter that the process “appears to have been healing for all involved.”
From the bench, Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Laura Crivello said she found the agreement to be fair and just and commended the work of all the parties to come to a resolution.
“Maybe this is the spark that makes other people see similarities in each other and not differences,” she said. “Maybe this is the spark that makes them think about restorative justice and how do we come together. And maybe this is part of the spark that decreases the violence in our community and leads us to finding the paths to have those circles to sit down and have the dialogue and to have that conversation. So maybe there’s some good that comes out of it.”
Craig Stingley, Corey’s father, said during the hearing that his 13-year struggle “has turned into triumph.”
Earlier, the Stingley family filed a statement with the court affirming its support for the agreement and the restorative justice process.
“We sought not vengeance, but acknowledgement — of Corey’s life, his humanity, and the depth of our loss,” it states. “We believe this agreement honors Corey’s memory and offers a model of how people can come together, even after profound harm, to seek understanding and healing.”
The family remembered Stingley as a “vibrant, loving son, brother, and friend” and found that the restorative dialogues brought “truth, understanding, and a measure of healing that the traditional court process could not.”
Jonathan LaVoy, Cole’s attorney, told reporters after the hearing: “This has been a long 13 years. He’s been under investigation with multiple reviews over that time. I think everyone is just so happy that this day has come, that there’s been some finality to this whole situation.”

In a joint written statement provided to the court, Beringer and Cole said they came to recognize “the profound ripple effects” of the incident and their connection to Stingley’s death. They expressed sorrow that Stingley’s “time on this earth ended far too soon.”
The proceeding followed years of work by Craig Stingley to force the justice system to view his son as a crime victim whose life was unlawfully cut short by Beringer, Cole and another store patron, Mario Laumann, who died in 2022.
Prosecutors at the time declined to charge anyone, saying the men did not intend to kill Corey Stingley when they tackled him and pinned him to the floor of VJ’s Food Mart, in West Allis, Wisconsin. They were detaining him for police after the youth attempted to steal bottles of Smirnoff Ice. In surveillance video, Laumann can be seen holding Stingley in a chokehold while the other two men aided in restraining him. A witness told police Laumann was “squeezing the hell” out of the teenager.
The Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office found that Stingley died of a brain injury due to asphyxiation after a “violent struggle with multiple individuals.” It ruled the death a homicide.
Under Wisconsin law, the charge of felony murder is brought in cases in which someone dies during the commission of another alleged crime — in this case false imprisonment.

Ozanne wrote to the court that his analysis found that “there is no doubt Cole, Beringer and Laumann caused Corey Stingley’s death.”
All three men, he wrote, restrained Stingley “intentionally and without his consent” and without legal authority to “arrest” him. “Simply put, Corey, a teenager, was tackled and restrained to the ground by three grown men because they suspected him of shoplifting,” Ozanne wrote. “They killed him while piled on top of his body awaiting the police.”
But he noted that there is no evidence that Beringer or Cole knew that Stingley was in medical distress during the incident. He described their hold on him as “rudimentary detention techniques.”
It was Laumann, Ozanne concluded, who “strangled Corey Stingley to death.” Ozanne wrote that surveillance video shows Laumann’s arm for several minutes across Stingley’s neck “as he fades out of consciousness.”
If Laumann were still alive, Ozanne said in court, prosecutors likely would have been seeking a lengthy prison term for him.
Stingley died the same year as Trayvon Martin, a Black Florida teen shot to death by a neighborhood volunteer watchman, who was acquitted in 2013. Martin’s case drew national attention and led to the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement. But Stingley’s death after being restrained by three white men did not garner widespread notice outside Wisconsin.
Over the years, Craig Stingley unsuccessfully advocated for the men to face charges. Two prosecutors reviewed the case, but nothing came of it.
He then discovered an obscure “John Doe” statute, dating back to Wisconsin’s territorial days, that allows a private citizen to ask a judge to consider whether a crime has been committed and, if so, by whom when a district attorney can’t or won’t do so.
Stingley filed such a petition in late 2020. That led to the appointment of Ozanne as a special prosecutor to review the matter yet again. In 2024, Ozanne informed the Stingley family that his office had found evidence of a crime but that a guilty verdict was not assured for the remaining two men.
That set in motion an effort to achieve healing and accountability through a restorative justice process. Restorative justice programs bring together survivors and offenders for conversations, led by trained facilitators, to work toward understanding and healing and how best to make amends. Last year, Stingley and members of his family met on separate occasions with both Cole and Beringer through the Andrew Center for Restorative Justice, part of the law school at Milwaukee’s Marquette University.
The discussions led to the deferred prosecution agreement.
In an interview, Anthony Neff, a longtime friend of Craig Stingley’s, recalled seeing Corey Stingley in a hospital bed, attached to tubes and a ventilator in his final days. Corey Stingley had been a running back on his high school football team. Everyone in the program showed up for the funeral, Neff said.
“Coaches. The ball boys. The cheerleaders. I mean, they’re all standing in solidarity with Craig and the family,” he said.
In the years since, he and other golfing buddies of Craig Stingley’s have provided emotional support in his quest. Neff called it “a lesson in civics, a master lesson in civics.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/craig-stingley-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 12:57:44.537908

The person was exposed to the highly contagious disease by an out-of-state traveler in Fayette County between Dec. 31 and Jan. 2, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services said. 
This is the first case in a Kentuckian since July 2025, the cabinet said.

“Measles is a serious and contagious virus that has seen a resurgence in recent years,” Dr. Steven Stack, the cabinet secretary, said in a statement. “We continue to urge families to take these risks seriously and to protect themselves and their communities by getting the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”
Public health officials said they are investigating any additional exposures related to this case and contacting people who they believe were exposed. 
The state recently reported another potential exposure around Dec. 28-30 in Grant County. 
“People who may have been exposed should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days after potential exposure,” Dr. John Langefeld, Kentucky Department for Public Health Commissioner, said in a statement. “Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and rash. If you believe that you have been exposed to measles and you have symptoms, please call your health care provider.”

According to the cabinet, there is a low risk to the general public at this time. Still, Stack and Langefeld said anyone can talk to their health care provider about the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective against measles. 
Measles spreads through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
“Health officials encourage good health habits to prevent transmission of measles and other contagious illnesses, such as washing hands often with soap and warm water, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying at home from work or school when sick,” the cabinet said.

Ford International Airport |  Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority photoThe Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy on Friday announced $9 million in grants would be awarded to 19 municipal airports across the state to help monitor and remediate PFAS contamination caused by firefighting foam. 
According to EGLE, the funding will be used for a wide range of purposes, including PFAS testing and monitoring, potential source control and cleanup strategies for groundwater and stormwater and to clean firefighting equipment and replace firefighter turn-out gear.
The department received a total of 21 applications requesting $14.8 million in funding, following a request for proposals from the Michigan PFAS Response Team, which was established in 2017. The team collects seven state agencies to ensure coordination in how they respond to PFAS contamination.
PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals used to produce things like food packaging, non-stick cookware and stain-resistant clothing. The chemicals break down very slowly over time and accumulate in the tissues of living things.
These chemicals have been linked to several negative health effects, including increased cholesterol levels, reduced immune system responses, interference with the body’s natural hormones, increased risks of multiple types of cancer and reproductive harms including decreased fertility and high blood pressure in pregnant women.

(Getty Images)The number of Floridians relying on a federal health care exchange established under the Affordable Care Act has dropped by more than 261,000 people after Republicans in Congress let expire the enhanced premium tax credits that help hold down coverage costs.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said 4,474,300 Florida residents used the federal health exchange known as healthcare.gov to procure health insurance for 2026, down from 2025 enrollment of 4,735,415.

Florida Health Justice Project policy director Melanie Williams called the 5.5% drop in coverage a “warning sign for families and for Florida’s economy.”
“When people lose health insurance, they delay care, face higher medical debt, and are more likely to end up in emergency rooms, which drives up costs for everyone. This enrollment dip doesn’t just affect individual households, it puts pressure on hospitals, local governments, and the state budget, and it underscores how fragile access to affordable coverage remains for working families across Florida,” she said in a statement to the Florida Phoenix.
“Florida Health Justice Project will continue to fight for vulnerable Floridians who deserve access to meaningful health coverage,“ Williams added.
Nationwide, nearly 22.8 million consumers had signed up for 2026 coverage, also a dip from 2025 enrollment of 23.6 million. 
Far fewer people buy Obamacare coverage as insurance premiums spike

Despite the decline in 2026 enrollment, Florida still leads the nation in ACA, or Obamacare, enrollment, ahead of Texas, where 4,113,465 people enrolled.
Open enrollment for 2026 health insurance coverage began Nov. 1 and ended Dec. 15 for policies that took effect Jan. 1, 2026. Enrollment continued through Jan. 15 for Feb. 1, 2026 coverage.

(Photo courtesy of Morningside University)Morningside University and St. Luke’s College – UnityPoint Health are starting off 2026 with efforts to begin melding the campuses together, having announced in summer 2025 that St. Luke’s will eventually become a Morningside location.
Jackie Barber, dean of the Nylen School of Nursing and Health Sciences at Morningside, and Morningside Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Chris Spicer said the first step in the acquisition process is complete, with hopes for full combination after the year ends.
The private colleges, both located in Sioux City, have worked together for a long time and have offered “joint two-plus-two programs” since 2019, Spicer said. This acquisition is an opportunity to expand that partnership and others, he said.
Barber said the idea for the acquisition was born from trying to think of ways to utilize both institutions’ strengths, as well as strengths from UnityPoint Health, to bolster “academic delivery of these health care programs” and the health care workforce pipeline.
“I think the biggest prompt is this vision of really needing to have a strong health care workforce in the Siouxland regional area,” Barber said.

While the initial announcement of the impending acquisition came out in July, Spicer said both institutions had been talking about it since the previous fall. The first phase of the process went “fairly smoothly,” he said, with the Higher Learning Commission approving the acquisition in November after September visits to both campuses.
The effective date of the acquisition was Dec. 31 and with that date’s passage, Spicer said Morningside has submitted an official notification of change in ownership to the U.S. Department of Education. Now in the second phase, university officials are waiting for that approval and other regulatory steps while beginning the transition process for St. Luke’s students, faculty and staff.
One point of uncertainty for St. Luke’s students at the onset of this process was how their transcripts and such will be impacted and how quickly, Spicer said. For now, St. Luke’s students will continue to receive St. Luke’s transcripts and degrees, but when that changes is contingent upon when further approvals come in this year.
“While we wait for this, U.S. Department of Education approval, St. Luke’s College remains a separate college with its own separate degree authorization, separate accreditation, federal student financial aid participation,” Spicer said. “And so it remains a separate entity.”
However, efforts to bring St. Luke’s faculty into the Morningside fold and meld together other services have already begun. Barber said Morningside faculty have been “very excited to receive the St. Luke’s faculty,” and the university is “very fortunate” to retain faculty from programs they’re bringing to Morningside.
Those programs include associate degrees in nursing, radiologic technology and respiratory care and a bachelor’s degree completion program in health sciences. Barber said these will complement the nursing and health sciences programs already offered at Morningside, and she hopes to eventually relaunch a medical laboratory science program that was discontinued due to a faculty retirement.
While the current focus is on ensuring the continued delivery of quality higher education at both institutions, Barber said an overarching goal of the combination is to strengthen pathways for upskilling and continuing education needed for the health care workforce.
“I’m confident that as we grow in the future, the hope is we will continue to add, strategically, programs that help support the health science disciplines and careers,” Barber said.
Morningside will not keep St. Luke’s RN-BSN degree completion program, as it has its own version of the same degree, and current students will finish out the program while new students will enroll in Morningside’s degree.
As for staff roles, Barber said the Morningside team “really had to look at not duplicating positions” like those in administration. Spicer added there were several retirements and other resignations happening independently of the acquisition that they were able to capitalize on, with an individual in St. Luke’s Registrar’s Office as an example, and “the rest of the staff positions were offered to the rest of the staff.”
Beyond questions of the combination process and how different groups will be affected, both Barber and Spicer said reactions to the news have been positive from students, staff and alumni.
Many of the people, both students and alumni, who are involved with one of the institutions actually have connections to the other as well, Barber said, from students starting in one program and transferring to another to complete their studies to working health care professionals boasting certifications from both Morningside and St. Luke’s through continuing education.
“It seems like this is a really good fit, because we had such strong relationships to begin with. And we know each other well, work with each other and stuff like that,” Barber said. “So there’s a long history with St. Luke’s.”

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
MONTPELIER — The economists tasked with diagnosing Vermont’s fiscal health every six months kept their top-line revenue estimates almost unchanged in a new report to a panel of lawmakers and Gov. Phil Scott on Friday.
However, Tom Kavet and Jeff Carr told the state’s Emergency Board, there are still numerous uncertainties for lawmakers to contend with as they develop a state budget for the upcoming 2027 fiscal year. Many are the result of actions taken over the past year by the Trump administration, like tariff, tax and immigration policies, they said.
Friday’s report details state revenue collections and pressures over the first half of the 2026 fiscal year, which started last July. 
State revenue over that time period varied less than 1% from the economists’ previous estimates, which were presented in July, Kavet and Carr said. Corporate tax revenue was down versus expectations, but that drop was offset by better-than-expected receipts from personal income taxes, according to the report.
Revenue from the state’s meals and rooms tax was also slightly down over estimates, a dip accompanied by decreased visitation from Canadian tourists, the economists said.
Legislative leaders and Scott had expressed concern in the leadup to Friday’s presentation that the economists would report a substantial downgrade in their revenue estimates.

Family Friendly Ways to Celebrate MLK Day in Delaware
“Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.” Those words from Martin Luther King Jr. continue to guide how communities across the country observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In Delaware, the holiday offers families a chance to honor Dr. King’s legacy not only through reflection, but through action and togetherness.
Two family friendly options stand out this year for those looking to spend the day serving others or enjoying time together in a meaningful way.
MLK Day Clean Up, Peace March, and Community Celebration
Families looking to put service at the center of the day can take part in the annual MLK Day Clean Up, Peace March, and Celebration in Wilmington. Now in its 14th year, the event is based at the MSK Community Center on the city’s West Side and brings neighbors together for a day rooted in care for the community.
The day begins with a morning neighborhood clean up, inviting volunteers of all ages to work side by side improving local streets and public spaces. Around midday, families and participants gather for a peace march that emphasizes unity and shared purpose. The event concludes with a community celebration that includes food, fellowship, and activities designed to welcome families and children.
The clean up, march, and celebration are free and open to the public, making it an accessible way for families to introduce children to the importance of service and civic pride. Full schedules, location details, and registration information can be found at:
https://www.westsidegrows.org/mlkday
YMCA of Delaware MLK Day Open Houses
For families seeking a more relaxed way to mark the holiday, the YMCA of Delaware will host free MLK Day Open Houses at its locations across the state. On MLK Day, families are invited to visit their local YMCA and enjoy access to facilities and family friendly activities.
YMCA open houses typically include opportunities for children to play, swim, and take part in age appropriate activities, while parents can explore programs focused on youth development, healthy living, and community connection. With locations in New Castle, Kent, and Sussex counties, the open houses offer a simple way for families to spend time together while reflecting on the values of inclusion and community that Dr. King championed.
Specific hours and participating branches vary by location. Families are encouraged to check details in advance at:
https://www.ymcade.org/event/mlk-open-house
A Meaningful Family Tradition
Martin Luther King Jr. Day is often described as a day on, not a day off. Whether families choose to roll up their sleeves at a community clean up or enjoy shared activities at the YMCA, these Delaware events offer age appropriate ways to honor Dr. King’s belief in service, unity, and compassion.
By participating together, families can help children understand that making a difference starts close to home and that everyone, regardless of age, has something valuable to contribute.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mlk-day-march-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 11:58:11.949988

Idaho legislative committee recommends state revenue projection assuming continued growth

The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, was originally scheduled to take up a report from the Idaho Legislature’s Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee on Friday.
On Thursday, the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee voted to recommend a revenue projection of $5.8 billion for next year, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Notably, that revenue target is about $137 million more than the revenue projection Gov. Brad Little issued Monday in conjunction with his State of the State address. 
But rather than take action on the revenue committee’s recommendation on Friday, without any public explanation, JFAC leaders started Friday’s meeting about 20 minutes late, pulled back their agenda for the day and removed the agenda item for the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee’s report.

 Why is setting a revenue projection important for state budgeting?

Setting a revenue projection is an important and closely watched step in setting the overall state budget because the Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed revenue. In that regard, the revenue projection serves as the upper limit for what can be spent each year in the state budget. 
The revenue projection is taking on increased importance this year because Idaho has experienced revenue shortfalls, and both the fiscal year 2026 state budget and fiscal year 2027 budget are projected to run a deficit. 
Little and legislators have vowed to avoid a budget shortfall by cutting spending during the 2026 legislative session.

It was not immediately clear Friday morning when JFAC might take up action on setting a revenue projection
Last year, some legislators from both political parties criticized JFAC for delaying action on a revenue projection until March 5 – 59 days into the annual legislative session. Last year, legislators waited to set the revenue projection until after they had passed major budgets and tax cuts that reduced revenue.
“This is the wrong way to do our budgets,” Sen. Janie Ward-Engelking, D-Boise, said last year. 
“I believe this revenue projection should have been set at the beginning of the session, and then we work towards that number in everything that we do and the spending and in the tax reductions or the tax cuts,” Ward-Engelking added.

Last week, just before the 2026 legislative session started, Senate President Pro Tem Kelly Anthon, R-Burley, told reporters that Republican leaders were hoping to set the revenue target to base the budget around earlier in the legislative session this year. 
“We’ve decided, as majority leadership, to try to do a better job this session (by) really hitting the revenue projection early and to work better with the governor’s office to try to get to that revenue number quickly,” Anthon said Jan. 8. “We’ll see how that goes, but that is the goal.”
JFAC is scheduled to reconvene at 8 a.m. Monday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

Mike Mueller (R-Linden). Jan. 15, 2026. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. In an attempt to ensure tighter safety controls on Michigan’s cannabis industry, Rep. Mike Mueller (R-Linden) presented a bill to the Michigan House Rules Committee Thursday that would establish a statewide cannabis reference laboratory to standardize testing facilities across the state. 
The legislation, House Bill 4501, would establish a lab that was first given funding in the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations and that has been in the process of opening since then. Derek Sova, a policy and legislative assistant for the Michigan Cannabis Regulatory Agency, explained to the committee that this bill was key to ensuring that the laboratory had the explicit authority to possess marijuana, given that it is still a federally illegal substance. 
There are currently 17 privately-owned and state-licensed compliance facilities or testing labs for cannabis in Michigan, Sova explained. But some growers will engage in what he called “lab shopping,” where they have their products tested by multiple labs until they get the results they want. 
Trump signs order to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, but it’s still illegal

This lab, he said, “will allow us to go in and audit the test results of the private labs.”
“We are not looking to take over the responsibility of the testing ourselves,” Sova continued. “Our goal is to make sure that the labs testing themselves, that the labs have to do with the testing are getting the correct test results.”
He added that the lab would also allow for investigations to happen in-house, as opposed to asking a private lab to do the testing for the state.  
“All this would do is have one central state regulated lab that would be able to take samples from each laboratory that tests the marijuana to make sure that they’re not getting bad samples or being pushed around by some of the bigger growers to manipulate some of the findings with mold, things that can go wrong with marijuana,” Mueller said.
Representatives from the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association and the state’s Licensing and Regulatory Affairs office also expressed their support for the bill.

According to a new study released by DataHaven, the legislation will exacerbate wealth and income inequality primarily through rollbacks on some Medicaid and SNAP qualifications and tax cuts favoring high-income Americans.
Some towns, including Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan, could see average annual tax breaks of more than $30,000 for high-income residents, according to the study.
The returns from the bill are heavily skewed toward high-income households. Greenwich will see an estimated $262 million in tax relief, Stamford will see $239 million and Fairfield will see $158 million. Greenwich has some of the highest levels of income inequality in the state, according to U.S. Census data.
Bridgeport, the most populous town in the state, will receive an estimated net change of $60 million, with $61 million in tax relief going towards high-income households. The bottom 25% in Bridgeport will lose — primarily through cuts to SNAP, Medicaid and other social service programs — more than $14 million, and low-income households are projected to pay an average of over $1,000 more annually.
This distribution is the case nationally. Baseline projections from the Congressional Budget Office found that, under the bill, “changes in resources will not be evenly distributed among households.”
Households falling in the top and middle income distributions will see an increase in resources, while households in the bottom income distribution will see a decrease. This is due in part to changes to Medicaid and SNAP but also to federal tax provisions, including changes to student loan programs and to health insurance subsidy eligibility, according to a report from Phillip Swagel, the director of CBO.
DataHaven used the CBO report data, which did not consider the impact of tariffs or indirect effects of the bill. 
Connecticut already has some of the highest income inequality in the nation, the fourth-highest Gini Index out of all U.S. states and territories, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 five-year American Community Survey. The index measures income inequality, with one representing perfect inequality and zero representing perfect equality.
Puerto Rico, D.C., and New York rank above Connecticut. 
Norma Martinez HoSang is the director of Connecticut for All, a statewide coalition of labor, community, and faith organizations. She said the state already has a “upside down tax system” that H.R. 1 will make worse.
“In Connecticut and across the country, over the last many decades, what we’ve seen is the very wealthy continue to get like tax breaks, definitely at the state level,” HoSang said. 

But now, things are worse, she said. Families are already starting to feel the impacts of federal changes.
“These are families that were already living paycheck to paycheck, [with] really no margin to be able to figure out how to pay for stuff,” HoSang said. “We’ve seen some families go without eating. It is here now, and if we don’t do something as a state, those effects are going to quadruple in the next four years.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mV1Gh-average-effect-of-h.r.-1-on-ct-towns--1024x809.png,,,2026-01-16 11:58:11.949988

While continuing to offer Success Beyond Six services that are funded through local dollars, with a Medicaid match that assists in making services more affordable to schools and districts, LCMHS’ School Based Clinician and Redwood Behavior Interventionist (BI) programs have expanded to address current student needs. 
The youth mental health crisis, which began prior to and then was expounded upon by the pandemic, continues to impact our children and adolescents. Student challenges with attending, engaging, and maintaining a full school day due to social, emotional, behavioral, and/or developmental needs, require creative collaboration with community partners. Working within the Multi-Tier System of Support framework promoted by the Vermont Agency of Education, LCMHS School Based Directors, Lamoille Valley Directors of Student Support Services, School Administration, and Special Education Teams, continue to brainstorm options to meet student needs across the 3 Tiers.
This systems-level collaboration is grounded in nationally recognized frameworks that emphasize shared responsibility for social and emotional development. The chart below comes from the CASEL framework illustrating the importance of coordinated community support for social and emotional learning from the classroom to district and state levels. School Based Mental Health works across all tiers to help promote intentional social emotional development.



For more information visit https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/.
Tier 1 – Universal Supports
School Based Clinicians are an important part of their school community and play a vital role in supporting their school climate and student sense of belonging. They attend Student Support Team meetings, assist in connecting families to additional resources, and provide clinical consultation and training on an as needed basis, with school districts contracting for professional development specific to youth mental health needs and education in the Attachment, Regulation, and Competency framework. 



Tier 2 – Targeted Supports
Tier 2 Support contracts began last year and have expanded to this school year. This model begins with school identified students who need specific times of support during the school day. This model allows for flexibility in serving Medicaid and non-Medicaid students. Currently, the Redwood Behavior Interventionist Program is serving 28 students with only 13 students that have 1:1 Behavior Interventions.
School Based Clinicians provide targeted short-term support to students who are navigating difficult times and run 6–8-week groups that focus on specific areas of need per their school population. These groups range from managing anxiety, identifying and developing healthy relationships, navigating life transitions, building conflict resolution skills, to art and movement-based self-esteem pro-social groups. Throughout the school year, more than 200 additional students engage in small groups or short-term consultation work. Consultation work focuses on developing skills to manage current stressors and/or working with school and family teams to create developmentally appropriate language and plans to increase school engagement and communication.



Tier 3 – Individualized Supports
 The Redwood Behavior Interventionist (BI) Program provides 1 adult per child (1:1) support, 1:2, and if needed, 2:1 contracted support. These supports wrap a school and family with direct staff support at school, service coordination for home-school communication and transportation, and Behavior Consultants to create and track evidence-based plans. Goals focus on academic engagement and achievement, and/or specific life skills for developmental disabilities. 
Smaller mini contracts for Functional Behavior Assessments are offered on an individual basis to support school teams in creating behavior plans to increase student engagement and success. 
The Functional Skills Program is a new program created this year to address multiple student needs while focusing on their individual goals. The Redwood BI program partnered with Orleans South Supervisory Union and Lamoille South Supervisory Union (LSSU) to provide two days a week of support in each district. The school district identifies the students and offers the service to the family and goals are created as a treatment team. These services can happen in the community, in the LCMHS school wing, or at the school. Students receive a specific number of hours of one-on-one support without the need or cost of a full-time Behavior Interventionist. This program also supports transitional age youth (ages 15-26) with life skills that include community volunteer opportunities and connection to employment resources. 
Creating greater opportunities for early intervention has been identified as a top priority within Lamoille Valley. LCMHS is stepping in to partner with LSSU public preschools and early education classrooms to support programing for multiple students carrying diagnoses of Developmental Delays and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Included in this contract is parent and teacher training, which supports social, emotional, and communication skill development for kindergarten learning readiness.



LCMHS currently has 12 School Based Clinicians serving over 150 individual students in 12 schools across Lamoille North, Lamoille South, and Orleans South Supervisory Unions.
School Based Clinicians are licensed counselors, counselors working toward licensure under supervision and/or social workers who provide individual therapy to students that are struggling across home and school environments. Student treatment goals, developed by the School Based Clinician and student, address developmentally appropriate social emotional behavioral skills, so that students may develop a positive sense of self in school and life. With School Based Clinicians being embedded in the school building, therapy becomes a space to build skills and then generalize across settings. Parent/caregiver, school, and treatment team support is also provided. During times of crisis, School Based Clinicians connect families with LCMHS’ Mental Health Crisis Team and can support the Agency of Education Behavioral Threat Assessment process by being on the school Behavioral Threat Assessment and Management Team. 
Being flexible and creative while upholding the requirements of Success Beyond Six funding has built close partnerships between LCMHS and Lamoille Valley school partners. As LCMHS continues to navigate the uncertain funding landscape and the fast-paced world, LCMHS is dedicated to supporting the ever-changing needs of our students and community. When we work together, we can make a lasting impact on student wellness.

The U.S. Postal Service did not change its postmark rules, although it did change its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify how it postmarks mail. The USPS states mail is generally postmarked with the date it was first received at a processing facility.
What did recently change, according to the USPS, is its “transportation operations that will result in some mailpieces not arriving at our originating processing facilities on the same day that they are mailed.”
Some people have raised concerns about the mailing of bills, absentee ballots and other items that require a specific postmark date. Connecticut voters should not be affected by the potential delays because the state does not require a postmark to accept an absentee ballot, but that it is returned before polls close on Election Day.
Those concerned about a postmark date, however, can request a manual postmark at the time of the mailing.

(LRC Public Information)The Kentucky Senate gave near unanimous approval to allowing officials such as sheriffs and county clerks to renew driver’s licenses in counties without regional offices, sending Senate Bill 7 to the House for consideration.
Sen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, the bill’s sponsor, on Friday told his fellow senators that “the burden has fallen too heavily on the people.” 

 SB 7 progress


“Our constituents have told us clearly that the current system for driver’s license services is not working,” he said. “Long drives, long lines, missed work, missed school — for a basic government service.” 
The only senator to vote against the bill was Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield. 
“It is not addressing the issues and I feel we should have,” she said. “We should be passing a stronger piece of legislation to start the work on.” 
Tichenor referred to a bill she proposed in 2025 that would have established at least one permanent, full-time, driver’s license regional office within each county with a population of 50,000 or more. 
In 2020 a law shifted driver’s licensing from circuit court clerks to the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, which led to the regional office system. The move helped Kentucky comply with federal requirements to offer Real ID driver’s licenses.
Kentucky established 34 regional offices that issue and renew driver’s licenses. Drivers would still have to go to a regional office for a new license under this legislation. It would allow counties without a regional office to choose one local official to offer license renewal services, who would charge a $25 additional fee to offset expenses. 
Counties with regional offices are “taken care of for now” and would keep all services at those offices, Reed said.
Return to ‘local control’ of driver’s license renewals is a priority for KY Senate GOP

During his weekly press conference on Thursday, Gov. Andy Beshear pointed to several factors that drove up wait times — which the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet says are now down to 11 minutes — including a 2025 law that let 15-year-olds get driving permits, federal enforcement of the REAL ID deadline and required vision screenings. 
“We think we’ve now gotten through that press of folks, that additional volume. Wait times are way down. Satisfaction is going up,” Beshear  said. 
His administration “may even have a counter proposal,” Beshear said, adding he would support having newly required vision screenings done at a more local level. 
“My concern about changing the system is everybody else is going to have to start from scratch now and go through possibly those six years  of the learning curve,” Beshear said. “I want to make sure that we don’t just scrap a system that we’ve worked six years to build and then start a new system from scratch, because I think we’ll have the same problems and concerns.” 
During a gaggle with reporters Thursday, Senate President Robert Stivers said the bill is just a “starting point” and could change as it moves through the legislative process. 
He said, as Reed has, that there is a need to address long drives to regional offices, long waits and insufficient staff. 
“The Transportation Cabinet, who is in charge of this under Gov. Beshear, has not been real responsive to a lot of the complaints that we have been hearing and receiving,” Stivers said. “So, we’re going to take our shot at it.”

(Photo courtesy of Byron Knutson family)A North Dakota man who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and later served as the state’s insurance commissioner and labor commissioner has died. 
Byron Knutson, a Democrat, was elected insurance commissioner in 1976, but was defeated for reelection in 1980. He served in the North Dakota House of Representatives from 1959 to 1963 and served one term as Labor Commissioner from 1987 until 1991.
Knutson died Dec. 6, 2025, but his family waited until the week leading up to Monday’s Martin Luther King Day holiday to announce his death. 
“Profoundly inspired by King, our father devoted his life to public service,” Rebecca Knutson, Byron Knutson’s daughter, said in a statement. “There are still so many injustices happening in our world. Leaders like King and our father are desperately needed.”
Knutson grew up in Harlow in Benson County. He marched with King in 1965 after serving in the Korean War as a Marine, and then the North Dakota Legislature. 
“When Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. called upon the nation’s clergy and lay people to support the rights of African Americans and all people to vote without fear of losing their lives, I was ready to do my part,” Knutson said during an interview with Jim Shaw in 2021.
Tracy Potter met Knutson at the University of North Dakota in the early 1970s. 
“He was a firm believer in civil rights,” said Potter, a former Democratic state lawmaker. 
Potter later worked with Knutson in the Insurance Commissioner’s Office. In 1978, Knutson introduced Measure 4 that was intended to address health care costs, though voters turned down the constitutional measure. 
Knutson was among the Democrats who were voted out as Republican Ronald Reagan rose to the presidency. 
Knutson was appointed labor commissioner by Gov. George “Bud” Sinner in 1987. 
In 2011, Knutson and his wife, Bernice, received the first Governor Arthur Link and Grace Link Award for Lifetime Achievement from the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party.
Potter said the couple’s commitment to making phone calls and the “grunt work” of Democratic-NPL politics was “inspiring.” 
“They were the most reliable people,” Potter said. “He was an inspiring character, always cheerful, a real happy warrior.”

It’s part of the Trump administration’s push to ramp up mass arrests and deportations using cash from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Congress passed last year at the president’s behest.
In an online advisory posted on Jan. 8, DHS laid out its proposal “to purchase, occupy and rehabilitate a warehouse property at 29 Elizabeth Drive, Chester, NY in support of ICE operations,” including erecting a small new guard building.  
The advisory, which was required because part of the 35.9 acre property sits in a flood plain, does not explicitly reference a jail. But The Washington Post reported last month about DHS’ plans for several new large-scale “processing facilities” for detainees, including one in Chester. 
Those new facilities are intended to hold immigrant detainees for a few weeks, according to the Post, before they are sent to large-scale warehouses in Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia and Missouri that will each hold between 5,000 and 10,000 people.
The presumed location of the Chester processing center was first identified by The Monroe Gazette. The property is owned by an LLC linked to former Trump Advisor Carl Ichan, according to the Albany Times-Union.
The likely lock-up has triggered protests and contentious community meetings in Orange County, where Congressmember Pat Ryan (D) is circulating a petition to attempt to block the facility. 
Town of Chester Supervisor Brandon Holdridge said he was working with Ryan to “disincentivize this rogue, unlawful, and un-American agency from stepping foot in our town.”
Asked about their plans for the Chester warehouse, a spokesperson for ICE declined to provide specifics.
“Every day, DHS is conducting law enforcement activities across the country to keep Americans safe,” a statement from an unnamed spokesperson read. “It should not come as news that ICE will be making arrests in states across the U.S. and is actively working to expand detention space.”
“These will not be warehouses — they will be very well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards.”
Since Trump took office last year, ICE has opened a new 1,000 person facility in Newark called Delaney Hall, entered into new contracts with several upstate county jails to detain dozens more, and sent around 100 detainees at any given time to the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal prison in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
The Chester facility would continue this trend and further enable ICE’s efforts to make more arrests in the New York City area, said Rosa Cohen-Cruz, the director of Immigration Policy at Bronx Defenders.
“Any increase in local bed space for ICE detention enables ICE to be more aggressive in their raids and their enforcement tactics because they have beds to immediately put people,” she said. “So we’re extremely concerned that New York City residents, New York State residents will really be at heightened risk by this increase in capacity.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26013668346196-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 11:58:11.949988
,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-16 14:48:43+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Next up on Beacon Hill: House leaders plan closed-door meetings on Healey’s energy affordability bill,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/next-up-on-beacon-hill-house-leaders-plan-closed-door-meetings-on-healeys-energy-affordability-bill/,"The political pressure to lower energy prices in the Bay State, home to the third-highest electricity costs in the country and rising gas bills, has intensified and will likely continue to escalate in an election year for both Healey and the Legislature.","LAWMAKERS AND ADVOCATES on all sides of the climate issue are gearing up again after the holiday slumber to advance a contentious energy affordability bill that left Beacon Hill scrambling during the waning days of last year’s session.  
House leaders are now planning a rare series of closed-door meetings for lawmakers next week totaling six hours divided between two days to discuss the path forward for legislation aimed at lowering the costs of energy that have animated residents across the state, according to an invitation viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.  
Those meetings will be led by Rep. Mark Cusack, a Democrat from Braintree who co-chairs the Telecommunications, Energy, and Utilities Committee, and House Ways and Means Chair Aaron Michlewitz. House Speaker Ron Mariano also plans to be in attendance, according to his spokesperson, Ana Vivas. 
The discussions will occur as the House looks to hash out the details of a complicated and sweeping policy proposal first kicked off by Gov. Maura Healey, who introduced her landmark energy affordability bill last spring after soaring energy costs prompted an outcry from residents around the state that continues to reverberate around the State House. 
The political pressure to lower energy prices in the Bay State, home to the third-highest electricity costs in the country and rising gas bills, has only intensified since then and will likely continue to escalate in an election year for both Healey and the Legislature. 
That pressure is coming from all corners. 
Cusack in November rewrote much of Healey’s original bill to use it as a vehicle to weaken the state’s ambitious 2030 climate commitments amid consternation about President Trump’s moves to rescind permits for clean power infrastructure. Cusack’s measure would also cut Mass Save, the state’s energy efficiency program, and reduce the amount of green energy that utilities are required to procure. That bill, which cleared his committee, exposed divisions within the Democratic supermajority and triggered a fierce backlash from environmental advocates. 
While Michlewitz threw cold water on touching the underlying climate goals and House leadership declined to rush Cusack’s legislation to a floor vote before lawmakers broke for the year, other pieces of the bill appear to be alive.  
There is genuine appetite among House lawmakers to cut or cap the Mass Save budget, according to one industry lobbyist and one lobbyist representing environmental groups, both of whom were granted anonymity to discuss the ongoing legislative negotiations.  
Mass Save, which is funded through ratepayers and appears as a line item on utility bills, is seen as one of the levers that the Legislature has in its control to immediately lower costs on bills, though the program is credited with saving substantial money and energy consumption over the long run through upgrades to homes. Cusack proposed capping the Mass Save budget at $4 billion, which would be a $500 million cut from the current budget approved by state regulators. (If approved, that cut would be in addition to the $500 million state officials removed from the program’s budget last March.) 
Such a move would have real consequences. Brian Swett, Boston’s first chief climate officer, said that cuts to Mass Save would directly impact the city’s ability to deliver on its Boston Energy Saver program that rolled out last year that aims to install thousands of heat pumps and provide free consultations to help lower gas and electric bills for residents. The crux of that effort relies on Mass Save. 
“We want to see Mass Save continue to be supported at the levels that we were reaching in the spring,” Swett said in an interview. “Fundamentally, we want to reinforce and not challenge the idea that the best thing we can do for Boston residents and ratepayers in all of Massachusetts, when it comes to energy affordability, is to reduce their need for energy.” 
Then there’s the question of who, at this point, has ownership over the legislation. The industry lobbyist said they are not sure who is actually finalizing the measure, noting that Cusack, Michlewitz, and Rep. Jeff Roy, who formerly led the House energy panel and now serves as a Mariano deputy in leadership, appear to be all vying for influence over the bill.  
Others don’t necessarily see that as a problem but rather an inevitability with an endeavor of this magnitude and consequence. 
“It makes sense there are several people involved because it’s complicated, technical, and the more heads you have on these types of issues to make sure we do it right, the better,” said the lobbyist representing environmental groups. 
Cusack, Michlewitz, and Roy all either didn’t respond to requests for comment or declined to comment on the record. 
Beacon Hill insiders likened the process playing out now over the energy affordability bill to the 2024 gun reform law. In that process, an initial gun reform bill in 2023 generated significant opposition, prompting a pair of closed-door, member-only meetings in July of that year. Mariano proceeded to punt further action until the fall, when a redrafted version – which limited the presence of firearms in public spaces, cracked down on “ghost guns,” and updated the state’s so-called red flag law – was released alongside a public hearing. 
Ultimately, after the Senate approved its own bill in 2024, negotiators agreed months later on what is now law following Healey’s signature. 
Earlier this week, Republicans released their own energy affordability measure focused on capping Mass Save’s budget, reforming utility contracts, and returning more money to ratepayers. In some respects, it isn’t wildly different from Cusack’s version, but it does serve to needle the majority party on how long the Democrats are taking to move on an issue seen as urgent and demonstrates an effort from the GOP to stake a claim in the efforts from Democrats to lower energy costs.    
“The majority has not rushed to come up with solutions,” said Rep. Brad Jones, the House Republican leader who co-sponsored the recently-released GOP energy bill. “The governor filed a bill many, many, many months ago. We’ve done nothing in response to her bill. Obviously the chair put out a bill, now we’re a couple months after that, and we’re now sitting down and having conversations. Look, we need to do something. Doing nothing doesn’t seem to be the best solution to a problem.” 
The fact that the House is even planning such a robust set of meetings on the issue next week, Jones said, shows that the Democratic caucus is “sort of all over the place” — but that there’s ultimately a hope that this process can produce something “consensus-driven.” 
Environmental groups are also looking to continue to shape the bill after they successfully beat back attempts to weaken the 2030 climate commitments. The Environmental League of Massachusetts posted on Wednesday that it is “actively engaged” at the State House on the legislation and is working to “ensure Massachusetts delivers real affordability solutions, accelerates clean energy progress, and stays firmly on track to meet its climate commitments.” 
Ultimately, though, the way the process has played out in just one chamber so far signals a long road ahead for any legislation that can tackle high utility bills. 
“If past is prologue,” Jones said, “it will certainly be many months before something is done, probably well after the heating season.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9835-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 09:57:43.044116

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Kansas’ top health agency is sticking with the longstanding childhood immunization schedule instead of implementing new guidelines released Jan. 5 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, a state spokeswoman said.
Although the Kansas Department of Health and Environment is evaluating the new vaccination schedule, KDHE does not currently anticipate changes to Kansas’ clinical guidance for childhood immunization schedules, spokeswoman Jill Bronaugh said in an email to the Kansas Reflector.
“KDHE is committed to the well-being of Kansans, and we continue to emphasize the importance of clear communication, transparency and trust in scientific evidence,” she said. “Vaccines remain one of the most effective tools for preventing serious infectious diseases, and decades of rigorous studies have shown they are safe and effective.”
KDHE will continue to review and assess the modified childhood vaccine schedule released by the CDC and how it could impact the health of Kansas children, Bronaugh said. In the past, the state’s vaccination schedule has followed the CDC’s recommendations.
The CDC’s newly released vaccination schedule dropped the number of childhood vaccinations from 17 to 10, a move vigorously disputed by leading health care organizations. 
“How often and how many vaccines children in the U.S. receive at certain ages is based on the times when vaccines will work best with children’s immune systems and when they are most vulnerable to certain diseases,” the American Academy of Pediatrics said. “Sometimes this means children will receive multiple shots in a short period of time. There is no medical reason to delay or skip recommended immunizations.”
Bronaugh said it’s important to rely on evidence-based sources when considering changes to the state’s vaccine recommendations that have longstanding success in protecting children’s health.
“It is also important to stress that childhood immunization schedules are intended to support, not require or mandate, evidence-informed, clinical decision-making and consistency in medical practice,” she said.
KDHE recommends that Kansas clinicians rely on their training and professional judgement, and that they follow the childhood and adolescent immunization schedules published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
“We remain committed to supporting clinical guidance and recommendations that provide the most accurate, credible and transparent information available for health professionals and Kansas families,” Bronaugh said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/child-vaccination.jpg,,,2026-01-16 09:57:43.044116

People from […]","(Getty Images)Members of Alaska’s Court of Appeals appeared skeptical Thursday about Alaska prosecutors’ claim that a Whittier resident from American Samoa violated state law when she ran for school board in 2023.
In an hour-long oral argument, a three-judge appeals panel heard arguments for and against Tupe Smith, who is accused of elections misconduct.
People from American Samoa are U.S. nationals — they have some of the same legal rights as other Americans, but aren’t citizens. In 2023, the state of Alaska charged Smith with elections misconduct after she signed a document declaring that she was a U.S. citizen.
She has said she knew she couldn’t vote for President but didn’t know that she could not vote or run for office in local elections.
Since Smith was charged, the state has charged 10 other Whittier residents with similar crimes for almost identical reasons.
The case against Tupe Smith is in Anchorage Superior Court, but after a judge ruled against her request to have her indictment dismissed, she appealed the dismissal. 
Unusually, the appeals court took up the issue immediately, without waiting for the Superior Court to rule on Smith’s guilt or innocence. 
Thursday’s hearing, in front of a three-judge appeals panel, has broad implications. Alaska has charged 11 American Samoans from Whittier, including Smith, with elections-related crimes. If their cases go forward, similar charges may arise in the future against other Alaskans who believe they are eligible to vote but are actually ineligible. 
That isn’t a hypothetical issue: The Alaska Department of Motor Vehicles accidentally registered dozens of noncitizens to vote between 2022 and 2024, and many were sent voter cards. 
At issue is the difference between “intentionally” and “knowingly” in elections law — does someone commit misconduct if they accidentally affirm they are an American citizen, or must they be aware they are deceiving an elections official? 
There are relevant definitions in other parts of state law, but elections law may be different.
Attorneys representing Smith have argued that state law specifies that someone can’t break elections law unless they knowingly attempt to deceive elections officials. 
Smith didn’t intend to deceive, her attorneys argue, and even an Alaska State Trooper investigating the alleged crime got the law wrong, they said.
Attorneys representing the state have argued that in the context of elections law, intentionally and knowingly should be read similarly, but on Thursday, the appellate panel repeatedly questioned the state’s arguments.
“At least for me — I don’t know about the other judges — I don’t think it can possibly mean ‘knowingly.’ It has to mean something else. But what that something else is, is where I think it’s difficult,” said Judge Marjorie Allard.
Shortly afterward, Judge Bethany Harbison offered a similar remark.
“It does seem as though the Legislature did intend … that there be a kind of consciousness of wrongdoing … that it includes an intent to deceive, because that’s what this case seems to be ultimately about,” she said.
“If the issue is that you have to intentionally — meaning you have to want to make a false statement … then that’s a defense, and perhaps the grand jury would not indict it,” Harbison said.
At the end of the hearing, the justices took the case under advisement, with a written decision to be published later.

Ralph Norman speaks during a press conference on closed primaries at the Statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. (Adrian Ashford/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A GOP congressman in a five-way race for governor is demanding that legislators close South Carolina’s primaries so that only registered Republicans can decide the party’s winner.
A hearing on two House proposals on primary voting is re-scheduled for next week, after initially being set for Thursday. U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, who had arranged a news conference in the Statehouse for immediately after the meeting that didn’t happen, blasted the Legislature’s Republican leaders as not making the issue a priority and promised that if he’s elected governor, he would “use the bully pulpit to get this done.”
Gov. Henry McMaster, who helped build the GOP into South Carolina’s dominant party, made clear he doesn’t think it’s a good idea. If either bill makes it to his desk, he’d likely veto it, he told reporters a day earlier.
“I’d have to study them some, but if these bills, and I believe they do, impose obstacles to the people voting easily and freely, then I would veto them,” the former state GOP chairman said Wednesday at the Governor’s Economic Summit in Columbia.
That’s a strong warning from a governor who normally declines to weigh in publicly on a Republican-sponsored bill while it’s in the legislative process. His usual response over the last decade has been that he’ll wait until the final version reaches his desk to review it.
Republicans have tried repeatedly over the last quarter century that they’ve ruled both Statehouse chambers to bar anyone not registered as a member of a political party from voting in that party’s primaries. But proposals to do so have never gotten traction. McMaster’s veto threat suggests the idea won’t succeed this year either.
The argument has long been that Democrats are meddling in Republican contests and shouldn’t be allowed to help pick the Republican nominee.
“We can’t have those in the opposite party stopping people from being elected,” Norman told reporters in the Statehouse lobby.
But McMaster said allegations that Democrats are deciding the Republican nominees are overblown.
“People suggest that that’s going to happen in just about every election, and so far, since I’ve been involved in it … it never happened,” said McMaster, who was state GOP chairman for a decade before voters twice elected him attorney general, then lieutenant governor and, in 2018 and 2022, governor. “There may be a few pranksters that go out and do that, but we never have seen any significant amount of votes happening that way.”
In South Carolina, registered voters can vote in either party’s primary. They just can’t vote in both. And they can’t cross parties for primary runoffs. In other words, someone can’t vote in a Democratic Party primary, then vote in the Republican runoff two weeks later. They must stick with a single party for that election cycle.
The bill being pushed by Norman and the hardline House Freedom Caucus he helped found would require South Carolina voters to officially declare they’re a Republican or Democrat in order to vote in the party’s primaries. Voters who consider themselves independents could not cast a ballot unless a party chooses to allow their participation and tells the state Election Commission that in writing at least 60 days before a primary.
But Norman, a former state House member, clearly doesn’t think the state’s dominating party should do that.
The Rock Hill Republican called it “an 80% issue among Republican voters.”
That refers to results to a question the state Republican Party has repeatedly put on its primary ballot. Both parties can choose to put so-called advisory questions on their ballots, which they use to both attract voters to the polls and make the case to legislators that voters want something. But the results don’t actually carry any legal weight. In South Carolina, voters can’t change state law through a referendum.
As for the repeated closed primary question on the GOP ballot, many voters may not realize what it’s really asking. In February 2024, the last time it was on the ballot, voters were asked whether state law should “give people the right to register to vote with the political party of their choice.”
More than 73% of voters said “yes” to the right to get a choice.
In South Carolina, the primaries are usually the contests that matter. In most races, the winner of the primary wins the seat.
In 2024, the general election was a given for more than half of the Statehouse’s 170 seats; 80 incumbents, plus candidates for six open seats, faced no major party opposition, according to an analysis by the SC Daily Gazette.
Two of last month’s three special elections for Statehouse seats had no Democrat on the ballot. The Republican primaries months earlier decided the winner.
Rep. Jordan Pace, chairman of the Freedom Caucus that publicly wars with the House’s majority GOP caucus, said the primary won by now-Rep. Dianne Mitchell is an example of Democratic meddling. Mitchell, a former teacher that the Freedom Caucus backed, narrowly won in a primary runoff by 20 votes.
Mitchell told the SC Daily Gazette that a Democratic activist encouraged Democrats to vote for one of her opponents in the four-way primary two weeks earlier, when she came in second. In South Carolina, a runoff is required if no candidate takes at least 50% plus one vote.
“It’s not my fault they can’t find a candidate to run,” she said of Democrats.
The House GOP caucus is backing a separate bill that would prevent crossover voting while allowing people who didn’t choose a party to participate in either party’s primary.
It would guarantee that “registered members of an opposing party can’t vote in our primaries on the day of the election,” said its main sponsor, Rep. Brandon Newton, R-Lancaster, adding “I would personally never support a system that doesn’t allow independents to vote.”
However, under his proposal, voting in a primary would automatically register that unaffiliated voter with that party, though the voter could apply through the state Election Commission to undo that.
The South Carolina Republican Party appeared to favor Newton’s bill. An email blast to the party faithful Thursday headlined “Protect the Integrity of Republican Primaries” included the bill number for the House GOP caucus bill.
In the past, some Republican candidates have outright courted Democratic voters. A super PAC backing former Gov. Nikki Haley sent out mailers encouraging Democrats to vote for Haley instead of President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential primary, according to copies of the mailers obtained by NBC News.
But Trump still trounced Haley, winning 59.8% of the vote to her 39.5%.
For their part, state Democratic leaders have said they want Democrats voting in their primaries, not Republican primaries.
“The idea that Democrats can strategically swoop in, outsmart thousands of Republican primary voters, and engineer a reasonable GOP nominee is not a strategy; it’s a fantasy,” state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain wrote in a November opinion piece in The Post and Courier re-posted on the state party’s website.
“If Republicans want to nominate less extreme candidates to be more palatable to most South Carolina voters, that’s their job, not ours,” Spain said.
Only 14 other U.S. states have an open primary system like South Carolina’s. Five states let voters cross party lines but automatically register them with the party whose primary they vote in, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Eight states open party primaries to unaffiliated voters but not members of the opposite party. Only eight states have totally closed primaries that require voters to be registered with a party to vote in its primary.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2803-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 09:57:43.044116

Steve Daines has roiled politicos in the Treasure State but insiders are at odds over how the military veteran and former GE vice-president’s potential independent candidacy could influence the race. 
Although Bodnar has not announced his intentions himself, multiple people have confirmed to the Daily Montanan that he has been considering a run for the Senate seat and is likely to make a decision soon.
While Bodnar is widely believed to be considering running as an independent, some Democrats believe a better chance of unseating Daines would run through party infrastructure. 
Bodnar himself has not declared a party affiliation and has been largely apolitical while at UM. He did not respond to an email from the Daily Montanan.
The last Democrat to hold statewide office, former U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, allegedly expressed support in a text for an independent Bodnar campaign while beating down on the Democratic Party, calling it “poison” during his own re-election attempts, according to a report from Lee Enterprises. 
Tester did not respond to calls from the Daily Montanan, but Thursday on his podcast, “Grounded,” he said Lee’s headline incorrectly painted him as unsupportive of Democrats. 
On the national scene political analysts are expecting a blue wave during the midterms as voters swing away from the incumbent Republican Party, which holds a governing trifecta in D.C.. But Democratic candidates in Montana are not very well known. 
Bodnar, on the other hand, is already a familiar name in Montana to both political players and the public.
He was floated as a potential candidate against Daines during the 2020 election, according to one state political operative, before former Gov. Steve Bullock was recruited into the race. 
The Rhodes Scholar and Truman Scholar at the University of Oxford also has a resume that matches many Montana politicians.   
He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. In the military, Bodnar served as a Green Beret in the Army First Special Forces Group and when he moved to Montana he joined the state’s National Guard. His military service puts him in line with other recently elected Montanans, including Navy Seals Ryan Zinke in the western house district, and Tim Sheehy, who unseated Tester, the last Democratic official to win the state’s other senate seat in 2024. 
Daines is the only Montanan in Congress without a military record. 
Bodnar worked for General Electric as a senior executive, and in 2018, was tapped as president of the University of Montana, where he has been ever since. 
A spokesperson for UM would not provide any comment about the speculation of a candidacy, other than confirming that no decisions had been made by the university president. 
But independent candidates are a longshot in any political race, much less a U.S. Senate race with a hugely advantaged two-term incumbent.
Daines, now the state’s senior senator, chaired the powerful National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign organization for Senate Republicans, last election cycle, achieving a major goal of unseating Tester, and in doing so, eliminating Democrats from all state-wide offices. 
In his 2020 re-election race, Daines came away with a 10-point victory in a race that had been seen as more competitive, due to the recruitment of popular two-term former Gov. Bullock as the Democratic nominee. 
Despite Daines’ inherent advantages, and perhaps buoyed by a national narrative that voters will swing left during the midterm, multiple Democrats have jumped into the race to challenge him.
Reilly Neill, a former legislator from Livingston, has been the primary figure in the race since she announced in late 2024. Neill briefly ran in the Democratic primary for the 2020 governor’s race, and mounted a write-in campaign for the state’s eastern House district in 2024 after Democratic nominee John Driscoll ran a low-budget campaign. 
Neill said she isn’t concerned about the possibility of Bodnar’s third-party run, calling him a “corporate shill” and saying she wants to know who is backing his run — including her suspicion that money might be flowing from powerful Republicans seeking to split the votes against Daines. 
The Cook Political Report ranks the Montana seat as “Solid Republican.”
Neill also said that the alleged message from Tester, which disparaged her chances of beating Daines, was “not a good look” for the former Senator. 
“Honestly, he can say whatever he likes about me,” Neill told the Daily Montanan. “I’m interested in the people of Montana, I’m on the ground, out there every day, meeting people face to face.”
“We’re having a good Democratic primary for the Senate, and Daines is on the run,” she added.
Alani Bankhead, of Helena, announced her candidacy for the seat in a video last week, touting her background with the Air Force, as a bodyguard to a “top Pentagon leader,” and her work on a task force combating internet crimes against children. 
The Federal Election Commission also shows Michael Hummert, a self-described “realist liberal Democrat,” and Michael Black Wolf, a preservation officer and community leader from the Fort Belknap Indian Community, have both filed to run as Democrats, while perennial candidate Charles Walking Child has filed as a Republican. 
Other candidates could not be reached for comment about the likelihood of a high-profile challenge from the UM president in time for this story.
Shannon O’Brien, the Democratic Party chair, said that the party’s role during the primary is to be unbiased and support all Democratic candidates, and that it is always recruiting and encouraging individuals to run for office.  
“We believe there is a blue wave that is happening right now,” O’Brien said. “Daines is vulnerable. Zinke is vulnerable. All of the Republicans are vulnerable right now. People are not happy with what’s happening in D.C.”
She answered questions about whether the party would consider supporting a third party bid by emphasizing her role in getting Democrats in office. But she also pointed to a value that unites the party.
 “We’ve got a job to do to get Republicans interested in tax breaks for the wealthiest out of office. That’s our job, as a party, and it’s my job to keep us laser-focused on that.”
At least in theory, a political party can also serve as a vehicle for a structured campaign. Some in the state Democratic Party have thrown additional doubt on the efficacy of Bodnar’s potential run as a third-party candidate without the cohesion of a party’s statewide campaign machine. Candidates at the top of the ticket — congressional seats for the 2026 election — can bolster or suppress support down the ballot, and convening multiple candidates for events is easy if they’re under the same party umbrella. 
But a financially-backed independent candidate could peel off voters from either party. As president of one of Montana’s flagship institutions, Bodnar would not be a new face to at least some voters, having traveled the state to boost enrollment and respond to calls to help UM form a deeper connection to communities in eastern Montana.
Tester’s text message, which cast doubts on the state party’s ability to continue winning in Montana, seemed to hold up an independent run as the way forward, but on his podcast, Grounded, Tester said that reporting on the subject had mischaracterized his views and support of the Democratic Party. 
“I spent the last 25 years, quite frankly, working to make sure that the Democratic Party can win, and that not only goes from Montana, but around the country,” Tester told his cohost Maritsa Georgiou.
Tester, held up as the last remnant of Montana’s former hybrid-purple political scene, has clashed with the state party since he left office.. 
O’Brien said she’d seen Tester’s text, but said there was likely some missing context, and her job remains to “get Democrats elected at all levels.”
“I’m proud to be a Democrat and serve as chair of our party,” O’Brien told the Daily Montanan.

(Getty Images)As a physician, it is clear to me that our mental health is one of the most important components of our overall health. 
Untreated mental health disorders can have a profound effect on our physical health and contribute to chronic health conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, but the human cost extends even further. 
Undertreatment of mental health disorders also contributes to poor academic performance, poor job performance, poor job stability, and homelessness. Especially in rural states, like New Hampshire, the impact of underfunding mental health care and substance use disorder treatment is very apparent. 
For these reasons, the Trump administration’s tactics of abruptly pulling $2 billion of grant funding for these vital services, and then reinstating the funding only after severe and immediate bipartisan backlash, is very troubling. 
Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced its intention to abruptly terminate $2 billion of grant funding for mental health care and treatment of substance use disorders, stating that the programs supported by these funds no longer align with federal governmental priorities. 
Within the next day, they reversed course. In the meantime, however, the impact of disruption to this funding for Granite Staters became abundantly clear. Organizations such as NAMI New Hampshire use these funds to provide a wide range of services, from children’s mental health care to suicide prevention, as well as crisis prevention training for first responders. Multiple school districts in our state use these funds to provide not just mental health care for students, but also to provide resources for food insecurity, housing insecurity, or substance use. 
New Hampshire, on one hand, has been one of the states most affected by the mental health crisis and opioid epidemic. We have seen that without adequate mental health care services, Granite Staters have no other option than to turn to already overcrowded emergency departments for mental health care. On the other hand, we have also seen the difference that funding evidence-based treatments such as medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorders or harm reduction strategies like needle exchanges can make in our patients’ lives. 
These successive announcements by the federal government demonstrated that beyond the disruption and the chaos, there is a real human cost and lives that hang in the balance. 
For the moment, funding has been restored but the message has become clear that these vital services — services providing critical support for Granite Staters and our children — are vulnerable and not a priority for our federal government. Tactics such as abruptly pulling funding without prior notification follow a dangerous precedent set by our current administration and pose direct harm to our mental health safety net organizations, and more importantly, to Granite Staters and all Americans. 
As a physician and a Granite Stater, I find this to be unacceptable. The lives of those who depend on these vital mental health services should not be subject to governmental whims. The lives and well-being of our citizens, and the health of our communities should always be the priority.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/opioids-1024x628.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 09:57:43.044116

Darin Chappell of Rogersville speaks in March 2024 during Missouri House debate (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).A plan to add Medicaid work requirements to the state Constitution was debated by a Missouri House committee this week, with Republican lawmakers hoping to put the issue before voters later this year.
The proposed ballot measure, if approved by a majority of Missouri voters, would make it more difficult for the state to reverse federal restrictions on Medicaid eligibility included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress this summer if those requirements change in the future. 
“The reality of it is this is coming to Missouri, irrespective of this,” said state Rep. Darin Chappell, a Rogersville Republican sponsoring legislation that would propose the change. “This is just saying we should keep it that way.”
Starting Jan. 1, 2027, the federal law will require adults ages 19 to 64 who are covered as part of Medicaid expansion to show that they work, volunteer or study at least 80 hours a month to qualify for the health care program for low-income people. The law also requires states to recertify enrollees’ eligibility every six months instead of once a year.
Proposed federal work requirements could cut over 90k Missourians from Medicaid

With Missouri’s Department of Social Services requesting an additional $131 million to cover costs this fiscal year of implementing the federal law, state lawmakers debated during the Tuesday hearing of the House Legislative Review Committee whether work requirements would slash MO HealthNet costs or add to the expense of implementing the federal law.
Chappell said the intent of his legislation is “to mirror what has been done at the national level already.” He believes the constitutional amendment would save Missouri money.
“There will be individuals who were not the original intent of Medicaid and choose not to engage in the work requirements that will not have access to Medicaid any longer,” Chappell told The Independent.
Medicaid eligibility changes in the federal law could cause 130,000 Missourians to become uninsured in the next decade, according to one estimate from Princeton University. There were 363,641 MO HealthNet adult expansion enrollees in December, an all-time high, according to data from the state social services department.
The ballot measure described in Chappell’s joint resolution is not identical to changes the federal law makes to Medicaid eligibility. While the measure would require the Missouri Department of Social Services to go back three months in an individual’s employment history to verify that they meet work requirements, the federal law only requires states to check one month prior to enrollment. And Chappell left open how often the department would have to verify that current enrollees are still meeting requirements.
“Some of this is going to have to be departmental capacity,” Chappell said. “I don’t know that it’s every 30 days.”
Democrats insisted the fiscal note attached to the legislation didn’t reveal the full costs of the changes and questioned why lawmakers should amend a section of the state constitution recently changed by a popular vote of Missourians.
Missourians voted in 2020 to expand Medicaid, opening eligibility to people earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level, though enrollment did not begin until Oct. 2021 because state lawmakers refused to fund it.
State Rep. Aaron Crossley, a Democrat from Independence, asked Chappell if he had considered a “trigger law” that would change statute to reflect the federal law, but only as long as the federal law remains in force. 
“Why not do that and then say, ‘OK, we’ll go back to what the voters approved a few years ago when federal law likely changes?” Crossley said.
Chappell emphasized that if his bill passes, voters will have final say about the constitutional amendment.
“If we believe in the will of the people, as I certainly do, why are we so afraid to let them speak again, to modify what’s already been said?” Chappell said in an interview with The Independent. “How is that horrible?”
The fiscal note included only the projected cost of putting Chappell’s proposal on the ballot in November, which comes out to roughly $9 million. 
But State Rep. Jo Doll, a Democrat from St. Louis, said that if voters approved the measure, the cost to the state would be much higher. 
“Where are we going to find the workers?” Doll said. “Because it’s going to take a lot of people to verify that someone has been working for three months prior and every month following.”
Gov. Mike Kehoe’s executive budget for fiscal year 2027 recommends a reduction of 238 staff in the state’s social services department, which is in charge of eligibility and enrollment for MO HealthNet. The recommended cut includes a reduction of 173 “income maintenance” staff, who according to a description in the department’s budget request, “determine eligibility for assistance programs.” 
In its supplemental budget request for the current fiscal year, the department asked for an additional $9 million in state general revenue and $123 million in federal funds to implement the federal law — partly to pay for income maintenance system updates. The department requested another $530 million to cover the adult expansion Medicaid population.
Chappell underlined that the ballot measure would not affect people exempt from federal work requirements due to disability or pregnancy.
But Crossley, who works in health care and has helped clients apply for Medicaid, said he has seen people lose coverage for administrative reasons that they were legally entitled to.
“If they miss one piece of mail and it’s time for them to renew their Medicaid…[or] they miss that one notification, then they’re off their insurance,” Crossley said.
Chappell acknowledged that some costs of more uncompensated care as more Missourians go uninsured could fall to taxpayers, but he said he believes the constitutional amendment would help people in the long run.
“If we encourage people to go to work, and we change the dynamic of their world view…so that they become part of the working population, I think we’ll see that they’ll increase their money that’s available to them,” Chappell told The Independent. “They’ll create for themselves skill sets whereby they can get employed and thereby have healthcare access through their employers.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chappell-031224-0728-1-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 09:57:43.044116

(Courtesy of Johnny Sundby Photography)Don Barnett, who died Monday at age 83, was the 29-year-old mayor of Rapid City when it was struck by a flood that killed 238 people on June 9, 1972. He received widespread praise for leading the recovery and helping to ensure that the city never again overbuilt in the Rapid Creek floodplain.
Barnett was photographed by Johnny Sundby and interviewed by Seth Tupper — now the editor of South Dakota Searchlight — for a 2022 book, “Surviving the ’72 Flood,” and a South Dakota Public Broadcasting documentary and podcast of the same name. Searchlight’s Joshua Haiar also worked for SDPB at the time and contributed graphics, music and video editing to the documentary.
The book chapter about Barnett is reprinted here as a tribute to the former mayor.
—
“On foot.” That’s how Don Barnett says he got himself elected mayor of Rapid City in 1971. A wise local adviser told him where he could win wards and precincts, and where he didn’t have a prayer.
It was valuable advice for a 28-year-old Democrat running in a strongly Republican town. Barnett took a color-coded map onto the streets and walked his way through a Rapid City winter and early spring, knocking on doors.
It worked. That April, Barnett became the youngest person to serve as mayor of Rapid City.
A little more than a year later on June 9, 1972, Barnett attended a conference in Rapid City on death and dying, which drew 420 people from the fields of medicine, ministry and the law.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Early that evening, he took his family swimming at the local YMCA. A police officer showed up around 7 p.m. and said more than a dozen urgent messages awaited Barnett at City Hall. Rapid Creek was expected to flood.
“And I’ll tell you, I just felt like a bowling ball was suddenly in my gut,” Barnett said.
He joined other local leaders springing into action. All the city’s police officers and firefighters were called to duty. The National Weather Service was issuing warnings about potentially high water, but as Barnett recalls, nobody anticipated the scale of the impending disaster.
Barnett responded to early flood reports on the city’s west side. He lent a hand to a utility crew turning off a natural gas line with a giant wrench near the Canyon Lake bridge. Under the pouring rain, Barnett said he was “wet from my head to my underwear to my toenails.”
“And as the crew went to put the tools away,” Barnett said, “we saw a little car that was bouncing in Rapid Creek.”
The car disappeared under the bridge, and soon there was a loud crunching noise. The Canyon Lake bridge floated into the lake.
Barnett recalls saying, “I’ll put a hyper-warning out absolutely right now.”
That was around 10:30 p.m. Barnett went to the nearby Canyon Lake Club and called local broadcaster Robb Dewall at KOTA radio and TV. Dewall aired Barnett’s plea to evacuate low-lying areas along the creek. But KOTA lost electrical power about 20 minutes later, and about 70 percent of the city was already without power for radios and televisions.
And by then, a deadly flood surge was underway.
Several feet of water inundated Jackson Boulevard near Meadowbrook Golf Course. Local Air Force airmen on the scene joined Barnett and Police Chief Ron Messer as they attempted to rescue people from homes along the creek, but the water was too high and the current was too strong.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Barnett used a megaphone to warn people there was no rescue in the short-term; he told them to climb atop their roofs and hold onto their chimneys. The rest of the night passed in a blur of activity as the mayor and other officials responded to devastation up and down the creek.
Two days later, Barnett convened a meeting of the City Council at the courthouse. Disaster-response specialists from the federal government wanted to replace the ravaged mobile-home parks along the creek with temporary housing.
That’s when Rapid City’s public works director, Leonard “Swanny” Swanson, uttered the words Barnett says are “tattooed on my brain and on my soul.”
“No,” Swanson began, according to Barnett. “We cannot sentence the survivors to one more night on the suicidal floodplain.”
Barnett called for a vote, and it was unanimous. There would be no reconstruction of the destroyed residential areas alongside the creek. The temporary housing, and the permanent rebuilding effort, would move to other parts of the city.
That’s why a greenway and a paved recreational trail — named the Leonard F. Swanson Memorial Pathway — parallel the creek’s winding course through the city today, ensuring no future flood will wreak as much death and devastation as the Rapid City Flood of 1972.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking Monday off to honor Martin Luther King Jr. and will be back in your inboxes Tuesday.
In 2024, California and Google made a deal to spend $175 million over five years on local journalism. This deal came after Google spent $11 million lobbying against two bills that would have required the $4 trillion company to pay newsrooms for using the news they create. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest budget proposal has no money for that fund. The deal struck between the state and Google, one of the most valuable companies in human history, calls for the tech giant to match state funding. That’s according to Erin Ivie, a spokesperson for Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat instrumental in brokering the deal. So, if the state contribution to the local journalism fund is zero dollars, Google’s contribution to the fund will be zero dollars. 
There are no legal consequences if Google never contributes more money to the agreement. 

Ivie: “The deal was never etched in paper and signed by any party — it was a handshake agreement in principle, and no parties are legally bound to its terms. There was never any penalty or consequence built into the agreement, as the arrangement is voluntary, not coercive.”

So far, not even the $20 million that California and Google collectively put into the fund has made it to newsrooms, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu. 
As Stella notes in her story, a 2019 study estimated that in one single year (2018), Google made $4.7 billion from news sites. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, reported making over $100 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone. 
More than 3,200 newspapers have closed since 2005, according to one estimate. Google — which directly benefits from news without having to pay the cost of reporting, illustrating, editing or publishing the news — could pay its part of the original $175 million arrangement hundreds of times over with its 2025 third quarter revenue alone. 
Newsom’s office referred questions to Go-Biz, which said the $20 million will be distributed this year.

State Auditor releases report on housing department

From CalMatters housing reporter Ben Christopher:
State regulators at the Department of Housing and Community Development have spent the last five years forcing local governments to plan for more new housing in a lengthy, technical process that has left virtually every group involved fuming.
Local governments have bemoaned mandates, which they call unrealistic, and say HCD has foisted upon jurisdictions in an unclear or inconsistent way.
“Yes in my backyard” activists, who want to see local governments allow much more construction, have critiqued HCD for being too lenient on cities and counties that drag their feet. 
Now, in a long-awaited report, the California State Auditor’s office has issued its judgment: HCD is doing fine, more or less.
The department met its deadlines in offering local feedback, which was “precise” and “generally consistent,” the report found. 
The auditor did offer a handful of recommendations to spread out HCD’s workload and beef up communication between the department and locals. But for local governments looking for vindication or pro-development activists hoping the auditor would champion a more aggressive state crackdown, the report makes for a disappointingly lukewarm read.



Californians rally for health coverage


Advocates gather to call on leaders to address threats to health care coverage on the steps of the state Capitol in Sacramento on Jan. 14, 2026. Photo by Roberta Alvarado for CalMatters




With some analysts estimating that more than half a million Californians would lose Medi-Cal coverage this year due to funding cuts, a coalition of health care advocates, labor unions and progressive legislators rallied at the state Capitol to push lawmakers to find new money to fund medical care, report CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller and Jeanne Kuang.
Under President Donald Trump, billions of dollars in federal funding have been cut from California’s social services programs, including the state’s Medi-Cal program. Demonstrators on Wednesday called for Gov. Newsom and the Legislature to backfill those cuts, particularly to protect the millions of low-income and disabled Californians who would be left especially vulnerable.

Judy Mark, president of Disability Voices United, at the rally: “We know that you are not responsible for these awful cuts, but now the responsibility does lie in your hands. You have the power to protect us.”

The event underscores the dilemma Newsom faces in his last year as governor, and whether he should increase taxes — a politically thorny endeavor — or allow millions of Californians to lose their health coverage.
One major labor union has proposed a ballot initiative to impose a billionaire tax to make up the federal cuts, which Newsom opposes.

Look at school officials,Glenn Sacks,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/teachers-grade-inflation-california-schools/,UC-San Diego reports declines in freshman math skills despite rising grades in K-12 schools.

Glenn Sacks teaches high school Government in the Los Angeles Unified School District


After a recent University of California at San Diego report documented a decline in incoming freshmen’s math skills — despite K-12 school grades edging ever upwards — conservative critics have been blaming teachers and their unions for grade inflation. 
Grade inflation is assigning artificially higher grades for a level of school work that in the past merited lower grades. Put another way, it’s the increase in average grades awarded to students over time, absent higher academic achievement.
Columnist Karol Markowicz condemns teachers for letting “students’ grades balloon,” saying educators are falling down on the job. The editorial board of the Southern California Newspaper Group blames the crisis on teachers unions which, they claim, have been “let off the hook,” but whose “power will have to be curbed.”
But teachers are usually the ones resisting grade inflation. They’re usually demanding rigor and accountability. Also, our unions don’t tell us how we should grade; instead they defend our discretion in grading. 
So where does this grade inflation come from? School districts and school administrators. 
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, as in many others, teachers have been under pressure to eliminate most failing grades and to reduce the number of D’s they award.
In one low-performing high school, for example, after every five-week grading period, each teacher receives a grade summary with a chart showing how many of their students are getting D’s or F’s compared to the school as a whole. Each low grade is highlighted in bright red. 
Included is a lecture from the district that “a disproportionate number of Fails or D’s for any reporting period or for a single assignment immediately signals the need for revising the instructional program.”
At some schools, giving low grades has become a laborious process. It is not enough that report cards relay the message that the student is “in danger of failing.”  To give a low grade, teachers must also repeatedly contact parents and then log each contact. 
Teachers are already overloaded with paperwork. And in the face of having to deal with 30 to 40 sets of parents, teachers have a large incentive to say, “This is too much work; I’ll just give them all C’s” — which is, of course, part of these requirements’ purpose.
Yet people with a stake in education have numerous legitimate incentives to inflate grades. 
Many districts, including Los Angeles,  suffered significant enrollment drops during and after COVID. School officials perceive, not unreasonably, that making it easier for students to pass and graduate leads to better attendance and higher enrollment. 
In California, schools are funded by attendance. Administrators are right to protect their budgets and avoid the pain and rancor of layoffs. For them, grade inflation is a useful tool.
Another problem with strict grading: students who have no hope of passing a class are much more likely to become discipline problems. 
Late in a semester, there’s a tendency to have “travelers” — students who don’t attend classes because they know they can’t pass. They rove the campus, dodging school authorities. In these cases, administrators, deans and teachers all have an incentive to give everybody a chance to pass.
In large public school systems, many students come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some critics blame measures designed to help these students for the problems UCSD reports.

Guest Commentary written by

Eduardo Vargas
Eduardo Vargas is running for Insurance Commissioner as a socialist with the Peace and Freedom Party. He teaches high school environmental science in the Los Angeles Unified School District.


Over the holiday season California’s Insurance Commissioner, Ricardo Lara, quietly approved a 6.9% rate increase for Mercury Insurance and CSAA Insurance. 
Rate increases for Farmers Insurance Group and the FAIR plan are currently pending. Last year after the Los Angeles fires, State Farm received approval from the insurance commissioner to raise rates by 17% for the average homeowner.
The insurance industry’s most recent wave of rate hikes has been directly encouraged by regulators and politicians from both political parties. Caught in a hostage situation — where the insurance industry threatens to leave the state unless they receive higher rates and less regulation — California’s politicians are forcing the average consumer to pay the ransom, leaving us with an increasingly unaffordable and exploitative insurance market. 
A manufactured crisis 
Climate change has drastically increased the likelihood of destructive wildfires and other climate disasters. Since the catastrophic wildfires of 2017 and 2018, the insurance industry has been gnawing at the bit to upend California’s insurance regulations. 
Insurers took aim while searching for ways to mitigate the costs of repairs and rebuilds associated with climate disasters, without compromising their profit margins and long-term solvency. 
With Lara’s “Sustainable Insurance Strategy” they finally have their chance. At the heart of this strategy is deregulation, a promise of rate approvals and less bureaucracy, in exchange for the insurance industry returning to California and writing new policies in high risk areas again.
Through a coordinated boycott of California, the insurance industry has achieved the crux of what it wanted: public policy and regulation that allows it to pass the cost of the climate crisis off to anyone but themselves. 
By collectively withdrawing from the California market in 2022 and 2023, the insurance industry appeared to have all the leverage. 
Even now, most candidates for insurance commissioner say that unless insurers’ needs and desires are met, they will continue to leave the state, until there is no insurance available for homeowners. Regulators, who cannot see beyond the horizon of a private insurance system, have fallen for this pressure. 
Private insurers also are using internal claim procedures to pay policyholders as little as possible after disasters. Hundreds of fire survivors in Los Angeles have reported that the same insurers demanding rate hikes have yet to adequately compensate them for damages caused by last year’s fires. 
Adjusters are instructed to never put coverage denials in writing and are pressured by management to offer low settlements. Insurers prematurely cut off compensation for survivors whose houses are contaminated with carcinogens, forcing homeowners back into dangerous living situations. Instead of gauging the true degree of contamination in a household, insurers rely on sketchy research, funded and designed by the insurance industry to reach the conclusions insurers desire. 
Although similar stories occur after every major wildfire, regulators usually turn a blind eye, because they are afraid to challenge the power of the insurance industry.
Freeze rates and hold insurers accountable 
Californians must ask themselves: why are ordinary people expected to pick up the tab for the damage and destruction caused by climate change? 
As the saying goes, “If you break it, you buy it.” Those responsible for breaking our climate should be the ones covering the costs of mitigation or repairs associated with climate disasters. The fossil fuel industry, utility companies and their billionaire owners broke our climate and caused these disasters; it’s time they pay to fix it.
As insurance commissioner, I will freeze any further rate hikes. I will lead the department in market conduct investigations of the 10 largest property and casualty insurance companies in California. Investigations will expose the exploitative nature of internal claim procedures, unfair competition or illegal coordination between insurance companies.
That insurance is a commodity sold on the private market and not a right is exactly why we are in this situation. As climate change progresses, disasters become more likely for all of us. We all deserve the right to rebuild. 
Public insurance, not ‘market stabilization’
California already provides a de facto right to home insurance through the FAIR plan for all those who cannot find insurance. Still, the FAIR plan is not a public plan funded by taxpayers for all Californians. 
In 1968, the state of California ordered the private insurance industry to create the FAIR plan as an insurer of last resort, funded based on each insurer’s share of the market. The profits and losses through the FAIR plan are managed by such private insurers as AAA, Farmers, Mercury and others — the same companies who deny policies to begin with. 
Public insurance in California would not be modeled after the FAIR plan.
Without the motive of private insurance, which is structured to deny and limit claims as much as possible, a public insurance plan would allow maximum coverage through a tax on those who are responsible for the climate crisis. California without billionaires could fund a public insurer. 
The insurance crisis cannot be solved by maintaining the current structure of the private insurance industry. A crisis this big needs bold solutions. And I will work alongside every fire survivor and homeowner to make these proposals a reality.

Gavin Newsom’s administration is pressuring local leaders to pass ordinances regulating homeless encampments, among other requirements.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration is pressuring local leaders to pass ordinances regulating homeless encampments, among other requirements. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom has threatened many times to withhold state homelessness funds from cities and counties that aren’t doing enough to get people off the streets. 
This year, those threats seem more real than ever. 
Newsom’s administration and the Legislature are adding new strings to that money, which they hope will help address one of the state’s most obvious policy failures: Despite California’s large recent investments in homelessness, encampments are still rampant on city streets. But cities and counties already are chafing under the tightening requirements, which they worry will make it harder to access crucial state funds without directly improving conditions on the street.
To access state Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention money, cities and counties are being pressured to enact a policy regulating homeless encampments that passes state muster – a potential challenge in a state where local jurisdictions’ rules on encampments vary greatly, and many localities have no policy at all. The state also wants localities to get a “prohousing designation” – a special status awarded to places that go above and beyond to build housing. It’s a distinction that only 60 of California’s 541 cities and counties (home to just 15% of the state population) have achieved so far.
Newsom, the Legislature, local officials and other stakeholders likely will spend the next several months fighting about those terms, and hashing out the conditions for the $500 million in homelessness funding proposed in this year’s budget. 
Until those details are resolved, exactly what standard cities and counties will be held to – and what will happen to those that don’t comply – is unclear. But one thing is clear: The state is done freely handing out cash. 
Some counties are already feeling the heat. They report increased scrutiny as they apply for the homelessness funds already approved in the 2024-25 budget (which, thanks to lengthy bureaucratic delays, have just been made available.)
“They’re holding the counties’ feet to the fire,” said Megan Van Sant, senior program manager with the Mendocino County Department of Social Services. 
Newsom’s administration and legislators in favor of the new accountability measures say cities and counties for too long have been scooping up state funds without proving that they’re using them wisely. The new message to locals is clear, said Assemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva, a Democrat from La Palma in Orange County: “The state has been moving forward, not only with the investment in dollars, but also with legislation. Now it is your time to show that if you want these dollars…you have to show us what you’re doing.”
But the new requirements may make it more burdensome to access crucial homelessness funds.
“I worry that, one, we may leave more cities out,” said Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities, “and, two, that we may cause delays in the ability to get more people housed sooner, which I think is the goal.”
A tougher application process
Applying for state homelessness funds “absolutely” feels different now than it did last year, and the state is asking tougher questions, said Robert Ratner, director of Santa Cruz County’s Housing for Health program.  
Fortunately, the county just approved an encampment policy in September, and has started working on getting a pro-housing designation, he said. But the state still returned the county’s application with plenty of notes.
“It has felt, at times, like the goal post keeps moving a little bit,” Ratner said.
The county’s application still hasn’t been approved, but it seems to be getting close, Ratner said.
In Mendocino County, the state appears to be holding funds hostage until the county can explain its plans to pass an encampment ordinance, said Van Sant. The county board of supervisors is working on such an ordinance, though it hasn’t come up for a vote yet. 
But the state’s requirement puts Van Sant and her team in an awkward position. As housing administrators, they have no say in any rules the county passes that regulate or prohibit encampments on local streets.
“I wanted to stay out of it,” Van Sant said. “I still want to stay out of it. We’re housing providers. We try to figure out how to provide people housing. We don’t want to weigh in on enforcement. At all.”
This year, the requirements may get even stricter. Under the current rules, the state seems to be satisfied as long as a city or county can show how it plans to get a prohousing designation or pass an encampment policy. In the next round of funding, local leaders worry the state will withhold funds unless cities and counties have actually achieved those benchmarks. 
It’s all about accountability
At issue is the state Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program, which provides the main source of state money cities and counties use to fight homelessness.
Though Newsom introduced the first round of funding, $650 million, as a “one-time” infusion of cash for local governments in 2019, it became a recurring feature of his administration’s strategy to reduce homelessness over the next five years.
 For four years in a row, the state awarded $1 billion a year to be divvied up between counties, big cities and federally-recognized regional homelessness funding groups known as Continuums of Care. Each round of funding was described as “one-time.” Even so, at least a quarter of the money has gone to day-to-day operating programs, according to data collected by the state.

Last year, things changed. The budget lacked any extra cash for grant funds, and the state’s main homelessness program received no new money. Instead, the Legislature committed to spend $500 million — a 50% reduction from the last round of funding — in the coming fiscal year contingent on “clear accountability requirements.”
Those requirements for localities, spelled out in a follow-up budget bill signed into law last fall, include:

Having a state-approved housing plan, known as a housing element
Having a “Prohousing Designation” from state housing regulators 
Having local encampment policy “consistent with administration guidance”
Ponying up some local funding to match the state contribution
Demonstrating “progress” and “results” on housing and homelessness metrics

These new demands didn’t come out of left field. For several years now, “accountability” has been one of Newsom’s favorite words when discussing homelessness funding. “People have just had it,” he said in 2023. “We want to see these encampments cleaned up.” He has repeatedly threatened to withhold funds, and has gradually ramped up the strings attached to homelessness dollars.
But the current list represents an especially stringent set of requirements for locals hoping for a cut of what has been one of the state’s signature funding sources to combat homelessness.
Quirk-Silva noted that the current list of requirements is not final. She expects the administration to release additional legislative language in February. Legislators will fight over the details through the June budget deadline.
She expected particularly fierce pushback over any kind of “prohousing designation” requirement.
Revoking funds from areas of the state that lack such a designation would be “penalizing service providers for something that is outside of their control,” said Monica Davalos, a policy analyst with the California Budget and Policy Center, a left-leaning think tank. 
San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan wishes the state would focus on more concrete measures of success, such as the number of people housed using state dollars, instead of things like a “prohousing” stamp.

Gavin Newsom devoted most of his final State of the State address last week to touting what had been accomplished during the past seven years, and one boast was about California’s public school system educating nearly 6 million kids in grades K-12.
Newsom said his new budget would increase spending on the system to $27,418 per student, which includes federal money. He highlighted expansions in pre-kindergarten, programs before and after school and the melding of education with social and health care programs in “community schools.”
“These multi-year investments in education, they are paying off,” Newsom told legislators. “Just this year, we’ve seen improved academic achievement in every subject area, in every grade level, in every student group, with greater gains in test scores for Black and Latino kids. These gains are particularly pronounced in Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest school district.”
It sounded great but must be placed in a not-so-wonderful context.
Overall, California’s public school test scores not only fare poorly in comparison to those in other states, but have lost ground in some key areas, as latest results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress revealed in September.
In fourth-grade reading skills, a vital area since reading comprehension is the door to mastering all other subjects, California ranked an embarrassing 37th among the states in 2024 tests. Just 29% of its students achieved proficient levels, down two points from 2022. Black and Latino fourth-graders appeared to struggle the most.
California’s low reading scores should not be a surprise to anyone who has observed the state’s decades-long conflict over how it should be taught, dubbed the “reading wars.” For too long, California’s education leaders insisted on experimenting with trendy theories of reading instruction, such as “whole language,” while dismissing advocates of time-tested phonics as old-fashioned and even reactionary.
Other states acted while California fiddled around, having concluded that the way previous generations of students mastered reading was still valid. One of them was Mississippi, one of the nation’s poorest states.
As the New York Times recently reported in great detail, Mississippi was 49th in fourth-grade reading proficiency in 2013, but state leaders acknowledged the damage and decided to do something about it. Central to the state’s reform was adoption of the “science of reading,” the current name for phonics, while targeting efforts on kids in the early grades in an effort to prepare them for learning at all levels.
“Science of reading is really important; it was a key piece of what we did,” Rachel Canter, who heads an education reform group Mississippi First, told the Times. “But people are missing the forest for the trees if they are only looking at that.”
Mississippi also set tough academic standards and state political leaders made improvement a top-drawer issue — not just one of many. The latest national assessments found that Mississippi now has the ninth-highest fourth-grade reading scores.
It’s odd that, as Newsom ticked off points of educational pride, he didn’t mention the most important one: California’s adoption of phonics as its primary reading instruction last year. The new law enjoyed strong support from a governor who struggles with dyslexia.
Newsom’s boast about per-pupil spending exemplifies the Capitol’s focus on money in its education debates, rather than results. While a much smaller state, Mississippi spends scarcely half of what California does yet does a better job of teaching children to read.
Over the next few years, we’ll learn whether California’s educational establishment will finally embrace phonics, and whether we can catch up with Mississippi.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/020623-T.-Griffin-Stege-Elementary-SK-CM-12.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 08:57:49.636586

Joe Lombardo enters the 2026 campaign year with more than seven times as much money as his Democratic challengers. (Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)The filing period for politicians hoping to compete in this year’s primary and general election isn’t until March, but matchups in many of the state’s top races are already forming, and the fundraising battles are well underway.
Thursday marked the deadline for candidates filing their annual financial disclosure forms, which list their sources of income, and their annual campaign contributions and expenses report. The reports show most incumbents amassing sizable war chests and provide some insight into what groups and people are supporting which candidates.
At the top of the ticket, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is running for a second term and entering this election year with approximately $15 million. Meanwhile, his best-funded challenger, Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford, is starting with $2 million.
According to Lombardo’s contributions and expenses report, his official campaign account has $9 million on hand and raised $4.5 million last year. But his campaign on Wednesday announced that two political action committees affiliated with the governor — Nevada Way and Better Nevada — have a combined $5.9 million on hand after raising $4.7 million in 2025.
The majority of that PAC fundraising — $4.5 million — was done through Nevada Way PAC, according to the PAC’s reports. Top donors to the PAC last year include Station Casinos, Frank Fertitta, and Lorenzo Fertitta. Each gave $1 million. The Fertitta brothers are CEO and board of directors vice chair of the casino company, respectively.
Other resort industry contributions: South Point Hotel and Casino ($200,000), Venetian Las Vegas ($100,000), Boyd Gaming ($100,000) and Caesars Entertainment ($70,000).
One notable donation from the non-gaming world was $250,000 from the Nevadans For Fair Recovery, a PAC affiliated with Uber. The rideshare giant last year was in a battle with trial lawyers over legal liability laws and attorney fee caps. (That effort ended with the Nevada State Legislature passing, and Lombardo signing, a compromise bill.)
The other PAC affiliated with the governor, Better Nevada, raised $266,000 in 2025. All of it from a single source: an Ohio-based dark money outfit called A Public Voice Inc.
Lombardo also has more than $115,000 in his legal defense fund, according to a separate contributions and expenses report filed this week. That account was set up after 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary candidate Joey Gilbert challenged Lombardo’s win. (Lombardo won. Gilbert was ordered to cover Lombardo’s attorney’s fees.) Lombardo later used the fund to defend a legal battle with the Nevada Ethics Commission, which censured him for improperly using his Clark County sheriff’s badge and uniform in campaign materials.
Lombardo’s campaign in a press release Wednesday said he is in “the strongest financial position of any governor in Nevada history at this stage of the cycle.”
For comparison, in January 2022, then-Gov. Steve Sisolak announced he’d raised $4.45 million in 2021 and had $8.28 million on hand. Sisolak would go on to lose his seat that year to Lombardo, whose campaign in early 2022 had $2.6 million on hand.
Ford, who officially launched his campaign in July, raised just under $2 million last year. He has $1.5 million on hand.
Forward Nevada PAC, which is affiliated with Ford, raised an additional $470,000, according to its report.
Ford’s campaign called it “one of the strongest fundraising starts by a gubernatorial challenger in Nevada history.”
As one of the only states where state government control is split between Republicans and Democrats, Nevada’s gubernatorial race is expected to be hotly watched this November.
Before then will  be the June primary. Irina Hansen, a Las Vegas businesswoman who came in ninth in the city’s mayoral primary last year, and Matthew Winterhawk, a conservative who says he fights indoctrination in the public education system, have publicly announced they intend to run against Lombardo in the Republican primary.
Neither candidate had filed a contributions and expenses report as of late Thursday.
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill has also announced her intent to run for governor. Her contributions and expenses report had not been uploaded by late Thursday, but according to her campaign she has raised around $271,000 since September and has $60,000 on hand.
In a video posted to social media earlier in the day, Hill criticized her opponents for bragging about their fundraising totals.
“They think that’s some sort of badge of honor, while real Nevadans are struggling,” she said. “They are more interested in selling out than in actually addressing our severe problems in the state.”
Attorney General
Four candidates have announced their hope to succeed Ford as Nevada attorney general: Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, State Treasurer Zach Conine, Douglas County Commissioner Danny Tarkanian, and former Cannabis Compliance Board Chair Adriana Guzmán Fralick.
When it comes to their official campaign accounts, about $159,000 separates the two Democrats, Cannizzaro and Conine. About $164,000 separate the two Republicans, Tarkanian and Guzmán Fralick.
Cannizzaro is starting the year with $815,319 on hand; Conine has $656,200.
She raised $645,387 last year. He raised $459,594.
However, Conine’s Let’s Get to Work PAC raised $1 million last year from one donor: Blockchains founder and CEO Jeffrey Berns.
Berns is the millionaire behind a 2021 failed proposal to allow tech companies to form their own governments. Berns has donated to Conine’s PAC in past election cycles, though his previous highest donation was $500,000.
Cannizzaro has at least two affiliated PACs but her campaign did not mention them in their release announcing fundraising totals.
Meanwhile, on the Republican side, Tarkanian reported having $340,529 on hand at the start of the year. Guzmán Fralick reported having $175,823. 
Guzmán Fralick, who announced her candidacy in October, raised $198,719 in the last four months of the year. Tarkanian raised $390,476 across the whole year and out fundraised his primary competitor during the last four months.
In December, Lombardo publicly endorsed Guzmán Fralick, prompting Tarkanian to issue a press release accusing “the deep-state consulting class” of recruiting “a candidate they could control.”
According to her campaign bio, Guzmán Fralick is an attorney who has previously served as legal counsel for a variety of public bodies, including the Public Utilities Commission and Gov. Jim Gibbons, and as a chief deputy district attorney and deputy city manager for Carson City.
Lieutenant governor
Nevada’s tightest fundraising race appears to be in the only state constitutional office that is a part time job: lieutenant governor.
Only around $6,600 separate the campaign accounts of the incumbent, Republican Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony, and his Democratic challenger, state Assembly Majority Leader Sandra Jauregui.
Anthony, who is running for a second term, reported having $232,026 going into the new year. Jauregui reported having $225,390.
Anthony’s top donors are MGM Resorts and Zuffa, the parent company of UFC. Jauregui’s include various local and national PACs associated with Democrats.
Zuffa also donated to Jauregui, though only $7,500 compared to $10,000 for Anthony.
Jauregui in October announced she would run for lieutenant governor. Before that, she announced she would not seek reelection for the Assembly seat she has held since 2016.
Jauregui, who survived the 1 October mass shooting in 2017, is known for her legislative work on gun control. More recently, in the 2025 regular legislative session and the 2025 special session, she championed a massive expansion of the state’s film tax credit program. That effort failed in both sessions.
A PAC affiliated with Laborers’ International Union of North America, better known as LIUNA, donated $10,000 to Jauregui’s campaign last month.
Anthony and Jauregui may appear on the ballot along with what’s become the former’s signature issue: banning transgender athletes in the state from competing in leagues and competitions that don’t match the gender they were assigned at birth. Lombardo announced he would be backing a proposed constitutional amendment targeting trans athletes.
Anthony has become an outspoken opponent of trans athletes, forming in the lieutenant governor’s office a “Task Force to Protect Women in Sports.”
Treasurer
The Nevada State Treasurer is an open race, as Democratic incumbent Zach Conine runs for attorney general.
Democratic Assemblymember Joe Dalia and Republican Drew Johnson, a former policy analyst who has focused on government spending and waste, are seeking the office.
Dalia, who is serving his first term in the state Assembly, reported going into the new year with $170,779. He raised a little more than that in 2025. 
His top contributors include a national nonprofit Write the World LLC, failed 2024 independent Congressional District 2 candidate Greg Kidd, and Democratic controller candidate Michael MacDougall. Each donated $10,000.
Johnson reported having $47,505 on hand. His top contributor was Marnell Gaming Management, which focuses on tribal casinos.
In 2024, Johnson ran for Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, where he emerged victorious out of a crowded primary but lost to Democratic incumbent  U.S. Rep. Susie Lee. In the election cycle before that, in 2022, he narrowly lost to incumbent Clark County Commissioner Justin Jones.
Secretary of State
Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar is the only Democratic incumbent running for reelection in a statewide race. Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford and Treasurer Zach Conine are both seeking higher office.
Aguilar reported having $543,137 for his re-election campaign going into 2026. He raised $389,563 last year.
Republican Sharron Angle has announced she intends to challenge Aguilar. In 2024, Angle ran for Nevada State Senate District 15, which covers part of Reno. She lost in the Republican primary to Michael Ginsburg, who would go on to lose to Democrat Angie Taylor.
Angle had not filed a campaign finance report as of late Thursday.
Controller
Nevada State Controller Andy Matthews, a Republican, started the new year off with $254,115 — $153,613 of which he raised last year.
That means the incumbent has a significant head start over Democrat Michael MacDougall, the only other person who’s announced he intends to run for the office.
MacDougall, a local high school teacher who announced he was running in early December, reported having $20,389. The vast majority of that came from two donors who share his last name.

But one bill in particular — HB183 — stands out as especially bad, said Marina Lowe, policy director for Utah’s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, Equality Utah. 
“That is by far the most harmful and outrageous piece of legislation I have seen in a long time,” Lowe told Utah News Dispatch in an interview this week. 
The bill — sponsored by one of Utah’s most hard-right Republicans, Rep. Trevor Lee, of Layton — is far reaching and would have broad impacts in a variety of areas of state code. The bill would: 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX

Strip out the word “gender” and replace it with “sex” in many areas of state law, including in the state’s anti-discrimination protections for housing, employment and crime victims. 
Ban changes to the sex designation field of a birth certificate.
Require state agencies when making administrative rules to refer to “biological sex” by using the term sex instead of gender.
Ban school districts and certain providers licensed by the Department of Health and Human Services from assigning a transgender employee to a role that interacts with children. 
In child custody proceedings, require a court to view a parent’s non-support of a transgender child’s gender identity as a “factor to favor awarding custody to that parent.” 
Remove “gender identity” from a provision that allows the Utah Division of Motor Vehicles to refuse personalized license plates that disparage a list of groups (which also currently includes race, religion, sexual orientation, ect).

To sum up the bill’s impacts, Lowe said it would “green light, by way of state law, the ability to commit hate crimes against the transgender community, to discriminate against the transgender community.” She said it would remove protections for transgender people for employment or housing.
Lowe argues the bill also “undermines parental rights in ways that are harmful for the trans community,” and requires discriminating against transgender people in jobs that are licensed by the Utah Department of Health and Human services, which is a “huge list of different entities.” 
“That’s hospitals, foster care, adoption agencies, substance use, mental health facilities, youth residential,” she said.
Another provision “basically allows for discrimination” against transgender people, Lowe said, by banning them from working in schools as teachers, staff members, counselors, or “any circumstance where they would come face to face with a student for longer than five minutes.”
The bill would effectively “erase transgender people from existence under state law,” she said — except in one provision, which “allows you to disparage transgender people on license plates.” 
Lee told Utah News Dispatch in an interview this week that his bill is aimed at “getting away from this idea that there are like 100 different genders out there.”

“There is no such thing as gender, it’s a made up word and term. It’s actually just two sexes. There’s male and female,” he said. “We need to get back to that basic biology.” 
He said he also wants “no more changing birth certificates” because “that’s stupid and it makes it very confusing for people, as we get older, especially our children.” 
Lowe said it’s one of the most egregious legislative attacks on transgender people she’s ever seen crop up on Utah’s Capitol Hill because it would basically undo years of progress to create equal protections for a class of people that do exist — whether Lee likes it or not. 
Among the most high-profile pieces of legislation that Lee’s bill would impact is a 2015 law, SB296, which ​​banned sexual orientation and gender identity-based discrimination in housing and hiring while also providing safeguards for religious freedom. The law is known as the “Utah Compromise” because The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and LGBTQ+ advocates all backed the bill. 
“Trevor Lee’s bill takes a sledgehammer not just to the compromise, but to each and every one of the legislative solutions that have emerged over the past decade where Equality Utah and largely Republican lawmakers have come together to try and solve really complex, challenging, difficult issues, in particular facing the LGBTQ community,” Lowe said. 
Lee refused to acknowledge that his bill would allow discrimination against transgender people in housing and employment, instead insisting that they don’t exist. 
“You’ve got to pick one. You’re not both. See, this is part of getting away from this complete, alternate universe that people have been living in for a long time,” he said. “There’s male and female. There’s nothing in between. It doesn’t happen.” 
Lowe said “it’s hard to land on any other conclusion that this is just a really cruel bill.”

“I really hope our other lawmakers will feel some of the fatigue around this issue,” she said. “This is now, gosh, the fifth straight year in a row that we’ve seen multiple bills targeting this very small and pretty vulnerable community.” 
Lowe said she hopes the rest of the Republican-controlled Legislature “decides against taking this approach, which really doesn’t improve anybody’s lives, it doesn’t solve any problems, it just leaves a vulnerable group considerably more vulnerable.” 
One of Utah’s most powerful legislative leaders, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, was one of three Republican sponsors of the 2015 “Utah Compromise” enacting LGBTQ+ protections while balancing religious freedom provisions. 
Asked about Lee’s HB183 during a wide-ranging interview this week, Adams — who rarely takes positions on House bills before they’ve progressed to the Senate — told Utah News Dispatch “it would take a lot to convince me” to make any changes to the anti-discrimination code enacted by the 2015 law. 
He noted that there’s a “nonseverability clause” in the law, which means that if “any portion is struck down by a court, that the entire bill would be struck down.” Legislative changes may not impact that provision, he said, but he still expressed concerns about changing the law. 
“There were a lot of commitments made, and it was artfully crafted and balanced,” he said. “I would be very, very hesitant to try to undo that balance.” 
Adams also expressed frustration with what he called “social issue” bills, which he said can be “distracting” from the important and “exciting” things Utah lawmakers hope to focus on this year when it comes to energy development, critical minerals, water, housing and other big issues that have sweeping impact in the state.
That may spell trouble for Lee’s bill, at least in the Senate. But it’s too early to tell how far the bill — or some version of it — will progress. The 2026 Legislative Session is scheduled to begin Tuesday, and will last 45 days. It also comes during an election year, when 15 Senate seats and 75 House seats are up for election.

Lee, when asked about the Senate president’s comments, said, “Yeah, well, times change.” 
“You would have never asked me 10 years ago if we had to worry about keeping biological males out of female sports,” he said. “Things happen. We have issues. We have problems. … If Utah, in my opinion, made a mistake in 2015 by giving an identity to something that doesn’t exist, I think that’s very problematic to everyone.” 
Lee also argued anti-transgender legislation is worth spending time on because he said “these social issues have a much wider impact on our state.” 
“Whether (Adams) wants to talk about them or not, these are serious problems that we deal with, and we run significant legislation around these social issues,” Lee said. “He knows that, and it’s unfortunate we have to deal with them, but we do. It’s just the world we live in now.” 
Lee added that “just like him, I wish we didn’t have to run these kinds of bills.” 
“I wish everyone had common sense like we all used to agree on with this stuff, but because we don’t,” he said. “We need to bring back common sense for society, not for our sake but for our children’s sake, too. So they grow up in a world that’s not wrought with confusion and identity-type politics.” 
Lee continued: “This needs to be squashed, needs to be taken out of the way, and we need to go back to common sense and the things that made Utah great, not things that made California a terrible place to live in this country with their types of politics. We want to protect ourselves from that. And that’s what these bills are doing, it’s making us go as far away from those blue-type states’ policies as possible.” 
Renaming Harvey Milk Boulevard after Charlie Kirk
Though Lowe said HB183 is by far the worst anti-transgender bill filed so far this year, Equality Utah is also opposing several other bills.
Another one sponsored by Lee, HB196, has especially sparked anger from Salt Lake City leaders and residents. That bill would rename 900 South in Salt Lake City — currently known as Harvey Milk Boulevard, named after the early LGBTQ+ rights leader and the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California. Milk was assassinated in San Francisco in 1978. 
Lee wants to rename that street Charlie Kirk Boulevard, after the conservative influencer who was shot and killed last year during a speaking event in front of thousands of students at Utah Valley University in Orem.

Equality Utah and Salt Lake City leaders have opposed it as not only an attack on an LGBTQ+ icon, but also infringing on local control. Currently, cities have the power to name their roads.
“Trevor Lee has an unusual, and truly bizarre obsession with the LGBT community,” Lowe and Equality Utah’s executive director, Troy Williams, wrote in a statement condemning HB196. “And it’s so curious that he wants to memorialize Charlie Kirk on the absolute gayest street in Utah.” 
Williams and Lowe added that Salt Lake City residents “know the difference between meaningful leadership and culture-war cosplay.” 
“Harvey Milk earned his place in history,” they said. “Trevor Lee, despite his yearning for our attention, isn’t destined for the history books. Frankly, he couldn’t even land his name on a cul-de-sac.” 
They said that if a conservative city wants to “memorialize Charlie Kirk, where he will be truly celebrated, then that is absolutely their prerogative.” 
“We are not going to pit Charlie against Harvey,” Lowe and Williams said. “These two men, if still alive today, would enjoy sitting down together, and engaging in spirited and friendly debate about the issues of the day.” 
When asked why Lee is targeting 900 South rather than naming a street in another city, like in Orem, after Kirk, Lee told Utah News Dispatch: “What a better street to pick than the one from the group of people who don’t seem to understand how to have a civil dialogue.” 
“Charlie Kirk was the best of us,” Lee said. “He was a man of faith, he walked the walk, he was someone who wanted to engage in civil dialogue with those who disagreed with him.”
Lee also accused Milk of being a “pedophile,” and said that it’s “embarrassing for our state, that we have a street named after him.”

Lee’s comments echo accusations against Milk that have circulated for years, stemming from a biography that says Milk was involved with a teenage boy who was 16 years old when they met in New York City in 1964, when Milk was 33. Milk was never convicted of sexual misconduct.
Those accusations against Milk resurfaced most recently after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered the secretary of the Navy to rename the oiler ship USNS Harvey Milk in June. 
The ship was first named after Milk in 2016 by then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, according to Military.com. Milk came from a family that had a history of naval service, and he also served in the Navy during the Korean War. He left the service in 1955 with a “less than honorable” discharge “after being officially questioned about his sexual orientation,” according to his official biography. 
Lowe dismissed Lee’s bill as “a petty move” that is “intended simply to stoke agitation and to get more likes on Twitter.” 
Lowe also disputed Lee’s claims about Milk and whether it has anything to do with renaming a street in Salt Lake City after Charlie Kirk. “If we wanted to look back into the history about inappropriate relationships between adults and underage individuals, there are plenty in this state we could talk about as well,” she said.

Renaming the street is “not a serious policy issue,” she said. “I hope other lawmakers view it as such.” 
“We just don’t view it as a serious proposal,” she said. “Lawmakers have such a limited time on Capitol Hill to really tackle the complicated and challenging issues facing our state, and to be wasting time trying to remove one street name and replace it with another, simply to stick it to the libs, seems like a tremendous waste of time.” 
Other anti-LGBTQ+ bills
In addition to Lee’s bills, there are several other anti-LGBTQ+ bills. Some were unsuccessful in past legislative sessions, but their sponsors have revived them in attempts to get them passed in 2026.
They include: 

HB193, sponsored by Rep. Nicholeen Peck, R-Tooele, which would ban public funding for transgender-affirming medical care. 
HB95, also sponsored by Peck, which would prohibit consequences against a public employee, including teachers, who refuse to recognize someone’s gender identity. 
HB174, sponsored by Rep. Rex Shipp, R-Cedar City, to require health care professionals currently providing cross-sex hormones or puberty blockers to transgender minors to taper their patients off the treatment. Utah lawmakers in 2023 enacted an indefinite moratorium on new prescriptions for puberty blockers and hormone therapy to minors. Lowe said she also expects an effort to convert that moratorium into a ban. 
HB114, sponsored by Rep. Colin Jack, R-St. George, would restrict drag shows and criminalize performing them in a public space or in the presence of a minor. 

Lowe said to see another year of anti-transgender bills surfacing on Utah’s Capitol Hill is demoralizing and exhausting for a vulnerable group of people who are already feeling marginalized and bullied by the Utah Legislature. 
“It’s got to feel just terrible for the transgender community to sort of wait with bated breath every January to see what’s coming, and to see so many bills come out before the session has even started is kind of demoralizing,” she said. 
After so many years of anti-transgender legislation, “it feels like there’s nothing else that can be legislated, and yet every year they seem to come back to the same issue area,” she said. 
“These are people’s lives,” she said. “I guess my question to the Legislature would be, you know, trans people still exist, even after all of these bills get passed. And what is the Legislature doing to support these families? They’re not going away. They still need help and resources.”

The APLS Board voted to continue denying state funds to Fairhope Public Library and declared ten books in its teen section, including Margaret Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" were sexually explicit and needed to be removed. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Public Library Service Thursday said that Fairhope Public Library remains out of compliance with the administrative code and will continue to withhold state aid until the library is back in compliance.
The library must remove at least 10 books from a section for teenagers that the Fairhope Library Board voted to keep there, including “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood; “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas and “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” by Stephen Chbosky.
“This is the right decision,” said John Wahl, chair of the Alabama Public Library Service and the Alabama Republican Party.
The move drew criticism from board member Ronald Snider, who has been critical of APLS’ increasingly restrictive policies.
“You are becoming the censor-in-chief of Alabama,” Snider said to Wahl.  “You are substituting your judgement over the overall benefit of many of these books.”
The board, which last year delayed restoration of Fairhope’s money in order to review the books, declared all 10 sexually explicit in violation of recent amendments to the state library code. Several board members based their votes entirely on a report from Wahl about the books, which first tallied the frequency of specific curse words, racial slurs and sexual words contained within the books.
Wahl then excerpted passages from the titles, and within each of them, highlighted specific sections that he said contained sexually explicit content that violates the APLS administrative code, such as an intimate scene in “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” by Stephen Chbosky and three passages in “The Handmaid’s Tale” describing sex.



Titles that APLS voted as sexually explicit


“The Perks of Being a Wallflower” by Stephen Chbosky
“Beyond Magenta” by Susan Kuklin
“The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood
“Crank” by Ellen Hopkins
“Identical” by Ellen Hopkins
“Shine” by Lauren Myracle
“Sold” by Patricia McCormick
“The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas
“Doing It” by Hannah Witton




“They contain parts that I would not want my child to read before I explain to them the content,” Wahl said. “I have that concern, and it is perfectly legitimate for parents across the state to also have that concern.”
Throughout the discussion, Wahl asked Fairhope to defend its decision to retain the books in the teens’ section of their library. Snider accused Wahl of ambushing Fairhope officials by not providing them a copy of the report ahead of time.
Randal Wright, chair of the Fairhope Public Library, told APLS board members that the library does not allow minors access to sexually explicit materials without permission from their parents. The library has a system that allows parents to choose particular library cards for their children that allows them access to specific sections in the library, along with specific books that they may check out.
“As a whole, I did not think there was a reason that these books should be moved,” Wright said.
Wright said that it is also the parents’ responsibility to oversee the content that their children read.
“Parents make those decisions, and if you, as a parent, do not like this book, then your child doesn’t read,” Wright said. “But you can’t keep that book away from my child.”
Wahl disagreed, and that parents cannot watch their children at every moment they are in the library.
“If a mother comes in, she has two, three, maybe four kids, she cannot necessarily police every single one of her children on what they are looking at in a minor’s section,” Wahl said. “She cannot be expected to.”
APLS will continue to withhold the first $11,000 allotment that Fairhope was supposed to receive in December, along with future quarterly payments it has been allocated for the current fiscal year. To regain its state aid, Fairhope must move the remaining 10 books that people said should be reshelved.
APLS board members first voted to suspend state aid for Fairhope in March 2025 after they fielded complaints from a few area residents who visited the library and complained that they found library materials in the teens’ section that violated an updated APLS administrative code adopted in the summer of 2024 that required libraries adopt policies to restrict minors from having access to specific materials.
The board updated the administrative code  in November to further restrict minors from having access to library materials that include “gender ideology, which it did not define.
Fairhope library has received an outpouring of support and received $42,000 from two nonprofits from donations they solicited on their behalf to help offset the remaining funding that the library forfeited in 2025 because they continued to be out of compliance with the administrative code.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260115_132213-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-16 08:57:49.636586

“It does not change election results. It only checks them or the post audit of the machines at random,” Lovvorn said on the House floor Thursday.
The Legislative Fiscal Office says that an audit would cost $35,000 per day. 
House Democrats debated the bill for hours, questioning its expense and necessity and saying it could undermine faith in elections.
“We want to make sure that they can trust the system, because there’s so much advocacy now against the system, that it’s rigged and all that,” Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Demopolis said Thursday. “But I have never found that to be the case here. And when you use those boring languages like that, you put a distrust in the people.”
During the 2025 legislative session former Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, filed a similar bill that passed the House but did not come to a vote in the Senate. 
Election fraud is extremely rare in Alabama. According to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, there have been 41 convictions for or findings of voting fraud in the state since 2000. By comparison, over 2.2 million votes were cast in the 2024 presidential election in Alabama. 
Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, said Thursday the money appropriated in the bill could be better spent.
“It may not be a lot of money, but to some places, the amount of money that is going to cost the state, I just kind of feel like we could use that in a better purpose,” she said.
Drummond also said doing an audit before an election could result in ensuring the voting precincts and machines are in accordance with guidelines.
Another legislator, Rep. Pebblin Warren, D-Tuskegee, argued that the state should be focusing more on mental health than post-election audits.
“Our first priority needs to be mental illness. If we can put $2 million on an election and allow as many people as we have in Alabama walking around the street mentally ill and not taking care of that issue. I think our priorities are out of order,” she said.
When asked by House Democrats if he had data to support the claim of discrepancy in Alabama elections, Lovvorn cited a pilot program.
“We’re using machines to run our elections, right then we just need to make sure working for your voters, my voters, so we can look and tell them we’re doing everything we can within reason,”
According to the Alabama Secretary of State website, a 2021 act passed in the state allowed a post-election audit to be conducted in Dallas, Houston and Marshall counties after the 2022 general election. Lovvorn said this program found one discrepancy but didn’t show what the error was.
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said without specific examples of voter fraud and election discrepancies, the bill isn’t needed.
“This is a frivolous bill. Even with your pilot program, you only came up with one incident. That’s not sufficient,” she said on the House floor.
Rep. Rick Rehm, R-Dothan, supported the bill.
“We have an issue in which our constituents, and it’s not just in Alabama, all across this country, are losing confidence in our elections,” Rehm said on the House floor.
Rep. A.J. McCampbell, D-Linden, offered an amendment to the bill that would have implemented a lottery-like system to ensure the random selection of precincts and voting machines. 
“If it’s going to be a random process, make it truly random. Don’t allow the subjectivity to creep into it. That’s all I’ve complained about,” he said after the House adjourned.
The House rejected the amendment on a 73-29 vote, mostly on party lines. 
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said after the meeting the bill will add integrity to the state’s election process.
“Anytime you get integrity to the people’s election, when they know that it’s safe and secure and they know that the machine is going to run properly, it’s a good day,” he said.

Brenda Shields, pictured presenting her child care tax credit legislation in a January 2024 House hearing, is hoping to expand gifted education in a bill heard by the House Education committee Thursday. Shields, a Republican from St. Joseph, estimates that 20,000 gifted students in Missouri are not receiving specialized classes to meet their needs (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).More Missouri public school students could receive gifted education under two proposals debated by the House Education Committee Thursday.
State Rep. Brenda Shields, a Republican from St. Joseph, is sponsoring a bill that would require schools to screen all students to determine if they qualify as gifted before they reach third grade.
She estimates that there are 20,000 Missouri students that are gifted but not currently enrolled in specialized classes.
The bill expands on a state law that requires schools to offer gifted education when at least 3% of their student body is identified as gifted. This requirement began last school year.
“If screenings don’t happen, gifted and talented students aren’t identified,” she told the committee. “If the students are not identified, schools will never reach the 3% threshold to be able to offer a gifted program.”
Gifted students can present as squirrely or distracted in the classroom, Shields said, with thoughts and ideas beyond the basic curriculum. Providing a more enriching education will help both the students and their teacher, she said.

Beth Winton, chair of the Advisory Council on the Education of Gifted and Talented Children, agreed that many gifted students “are not always a pleasure to have in class.”
“The standard grade level curriculum is not designed to meet their academic or emotional needs,” she said. “And regular teachers already have enough demands on their time.”
Committee members largely spoke in favor of the bill, sharing personal anecdotes of their experiences in the classroom as teachers, parents and former students.
State Rep. Ann Kelley, a Republican from Lamar, said gifted education provides a needed challenge for some kids. Kelley, who taught eighth-grade English, said she saw students who were never identified as gifted but could benefit from the program.
“By (eighth grade), they don’t really test very many students at that point. And if they’ve been missed in that window, they’ve already checked out,” she said.
The largest concern came from state Rep. Mark Boyko, a Democrat from Kirkwood, who wondered if requiring schools to start screening by this fall is too tight of a timeline.
“As someone who has been on school boards, I know that drafting a good policy for a district is a process that takes a number of months,” he said. “So I have concerns that the bill starts one school year too early.”
Bolstering Shields’ legislation, a bill by state Rep. Scott Miller would ensure districts have the resources to educate gifted students by adding a line to the formula that determines state aid for public schools.
“High-quality gifted programming often includes advanced curriculum, specialized instructional strategies, social-emotional supports with trained educators and individualized learning pathways,” Miller, a St. Charles Republican, told the committee. “These services require additional staffing, materials and professional infrastructure, all of which come at a greater cost than general education alone.”
His bill would fund gifted students 60% higher than the base per-pupil amount. Based on the state’s current per-pupil funding, this means schools would receive an additional $4,287 per gifted student.
This number may decrease if the bill moves along in the legislative process. The committee’s chair, state Rep. Ed Lewis, a Moberly Republican, told Miller the multiplier was “pretty high.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would have an annual cost of nearly $121.5 million, though Miller questioned the accuracy of the estimate. 
Lobbyists for education groups such as the Missouri State Teachers Association and the Missouri Association of School Administrators spoke in favor of the funding boost.
“(The state) really does need to have a component in the formula to support gifted students,” said Otto Fajen, lobbyist for teachers union Missouri National Education Association. “That is critical.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Spending cap will allow most CT budget growth in a decade,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/ct-spending-cap-grows/,It remains unclear whether a 5.93% increase in spending will cover growing needs in core programs — or offset vanishing federal aid.,"Connecticut legislators will have more room to spend under state budget caps later this year than they’ve enjoyed in more than a decade.
But it remains unclear whether that will permit enough spending to cover growing needs in health care, education, and other core programs — or to offset vanishing federal aid.
New revenue projections released Thursday from Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget staff and the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis showed little change in projected tax receipts for this fiscal year and next.
But the consensus forecast is based on household income growth in Connecticut that has averaged 5.93% annually over the past five years. And because of that surge, state budget appropriations, with a few exceptions, can grow by that same 5.93%, which translates into an extra $1.3 billion next fiscal year, which starts July 1.
Connecticut’s primary budget cap allows growth equal to the latest five-year average increase in household income, or to the prior year’s inflation, whichever is larger. Principal and interest payments on bonded debt, spending to meet court orders and new federal mandates are cap exempt. All remaining segments of the total budget, about 80% of a plan expected to top $28.6 billion next fiscal year, must share the allowable $1.3 billion growth.
At first glance, that seems great.
Allowable budget growth has averaged about $700 million over the past five years and rarely tops $1 billion, though it is set to exceed $980 billion this fiscal year.
And the percentage growth has only topped 5% three other times since 2017.
But most years, spending cap growth isn’t sufficient to cover all inflationary cost hikes faced by state agencies and programs. And in some cases, such as state funding for nursing homes, inflationary hikes required by statute have been suspended for more than a decade.
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities launched an ad campaign last year charging that education grants to communities, once adjusted for inflation, had declined by more than $400 million. The legislature and Lamont responded last spring by boosting education aid by more than $130 million this fiscal year.
And the community-based nonprofits that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored social services insist they lose hundreds of millions annually because state payments haven’t kept pace with inflation for more than a decade.
Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, co-chairwoman of the legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said “we’ve got some big-ticket items” to address in the next fiscal year.
Besides providing some inflationary adjustments, legislators hope to further expand investments in education aid, affordable child care and housing while bolstering understaffed state agencies.
The budget committee’s other co-chairwoman, Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, said last year’s investments in education, though significant, weren’t sufficient to ease pressure on municipal property taxpayers, who still cover far too much of the cost of K-12 education.
“We’re far behind where we should be,” she said.
Walker and Osten also noted that Connecticut expects to lose hundreds of millions in federal aid or more next fiscal year for human services programs, and many lawmakers want to see increased state spending to mitigate painful cuts to health care, nutrition assistance and other services.
But Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said majority Democrats in the General Assembly must get better about accepting cap limitations and prioritizing spending.
“I think it’s funny there’s never enough of other people’s money to spend,” she said. “That’s the sad truth.”
Nuccio added that her caucus also will be pushing to control spending to allow for a major state income tax cut that House GOP members called for in the fall. The caucus wants to deliver a much as $700 extra to middle-income households by expanding an income tax credit that offsets a portion of municipal property tax costs.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, also has pressed his fellow Democrats to live within the spending cap.
That metric “reflects our residents’ ability to pay,” Chris Collibee, Lamont’s budget spokesman, said.
Collibee also cautioned legislators about planning for too much new spending, noting that the nearly $1.3 billion in new spending allowed by the cap “will be needed to maintain current services during the coming fiscal year.”
Revenue growth is modest after surging for more than a year
State revenues, which already have grown considerably over the past year, remained largely stable in analysts’ latest projections.
Thursday’s report estimated tax receipts and other resources for the General Fund, which covers the bulk of state budget operating expenses, would approach $24.5 billion this fiscal year, up about $100 million from their latest projection in early November.  And they also upgraded revenue estimates for the next fiscal year by about $80 million.
In both cases, robust sales tax trends drove most of the growth, which nonetheless represents only a fraction of 1% of the General Fund.
“Today’s consensus revenue forecast reaffirms what we’ve been saying all along — Connecticut’s economy is resilient,” Lamont said. “Despite international and national economic uncertainty, our state continues to demonstrate strength and stability.”
The governor, who must propose his next state budget to the legislature on Feb. 4, added Thursday that “my top priority remains making Connecticut more affordable for middle-class and working-class families. We will keep investing in policies that lower costs, create good-paying jobs, and ensure that families and businesses can grow and thrive here.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_057-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 08:57:49.636586

(PRNewsfoto/GTL)State lawmakers and justice reform groups are questioning the associated costs and services available on tablets offered to those incarcerated at correction facilities. 
Assembly Bill 35, passed nearly unanimously during the 2023 legislative session, authorized those incarcerated within Nevada Department of Corrections facilities to have telecommunications such as tablets. 
Proponents of the bill said access would enable people in state prisons the ability to stay in contact with family members, access medical care quicker, obtain educational training, apply for resources ahead of release, and even access entertainment.
Only inmates at two facilities, Jean Conservation Camp and Carlin Conservation Camp, don’t have access to tablets, NDOC prisons director James Dzurenda told the legislative Interim Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. 
The costs to communicate and access services have been higher than expected, said Nick Shepack, the Nevada state director of the Fines and Fees Justice Center. 
“There was a promise that there was going to be items that cost, and there were also going to be items that were supposed to be super beneficial, but came at no cost,” Shepack said in an interview with Nevada Current. “What we’ve seen is exactly what I feared, which is they rolled out all the extremely expensive stuff and everything else is coming eventually.” 
One of the points of contention was the service charge to put money on the tablets that varies depending on how much is loaded.  
While groups were aware during the contract process that there would be a service charge for the tablets, they are still hoping state officials will step in to offer some sort of solutions to address those costs. 
Shepack said the charge creates a system where families with lower incomes who might only add $10 for a loved one incarcerated would pay an additional $5 service charge. 
“The minimum you can put on is $10,” he said, adding the people who are likely to add that amount are “living paycheck to paycheck like that, not even able to make ends meet.”
State lawmakers, at the behest of groups like the prisoner advocacy group Return Strong and the Fines and Fees Justice Center, have capped other punitive prices such as high markups of commissary items and health care. 
Shepack worried the tablets will create a new avenue to generate money off the backs of those incarcerated. 
“We’re at a point where lockdowns are at an all time high,” Shepack said. “That means more time in their cells … of course, people are going to lean on these tablets to not go crazy while locked in their cell. And the prices they’re charging them are just extremely exploitative.”
Dzurenda attributed some of the higher costs, such as rates to make phone calls, to unforeseen changes from the Federal Communications Commissions, including the commission rolling back regulations adopted under President Joe Biden that placed caps on the cost of phone calls.  
The rate was limited to 6 cents a minute in 2024. The FCC increased the limit to 10 cents a minute for larger prisons – 12 cents per minute for medium prisons – under President Donald Trump. 
“That’s where the phone call adjustments came up,” Dzurenda said. “It was based on the FCC ruling and not based on us.”
He added the department is expecting additional changes and regulations from the FCC later this spring. 
The department is also expected to receive a share of revenue collected from ViaPath, the telecommunications company contracted by NDOC to administer the services. However, Dzurenda said they weren’t sure how much revenue is expected or when it is supposed to be made available, adding it “was not spelled out” in the contract approved by the state. 
“We are still estimating and guessing at what that revenue is going to look like,” he added.
Democratic Assemblymember Brittney Miller, who is co-chair of the committee, was concerned that there wasn’t any idea what the revenue would be.
“We don’t know if that check is going to be $17 or $17,000,” she said. “I’m just concerned that, or perplexed, that was a part of the agreement during this entire RFP (request for proposal) and contractual development.” 
State Sen. Rochelle Nguyen also questioned the disconnect between the contract NDOC sought from ViaPath and what was ultimately approved by state agencies. She added it seemed like there were cheaper services NDOC sought that weren’t included in the final contract approved. 
Tablets currently offer a variety of services such as the ability to write emails, access to religious services, and streaming entertainment – though the cost to stream movies and music at 5 cents a minute is another point of contention among justice reform groups.
Other services like access to medical care or the ability for those incarcerated to submit grievances still aren’t available. 
Dzurenda said some of these services cost NDOC money but the department won’t know how much until it sees its revenue share from ViaPath.
NDOC, he added, is also having difficulty providing people with medical services via tablet because medical records can’t currently be accessed electronically. 
“We do not have access to electronic medical records, and none of this can go through the electronic system,” he said. 
Other services, like giving people the ability to file “grievances” for problems happening in the prisons, would require an update to the Offender Management System, Dzurenda said. He didn’t offer any details about the costs and process of updating the system. 
NDOC is also looking at other additions to the tablet including partnering with the Clark County Library District to offer GED courses on the tablet and adding word processing, which he said would help people with legal filings.  
He said he would want to include other services “that I know will be beneficial with programming,” he said, adding “It costs money.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GTL_Inspire_2_0-1024x445.jpg,,,2026-01-16 07:56:49.091181

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced the start of the investigation in December, noting that her department intends to identify, document, investigate, and prosecute instances where criminal acts may have occurred at these facilities. 
“My office is committed to ensuring that survivors’ voices are heard and that any criminal acts uncovered are thoroughly investigated and, when possible, prosecuted,” Nessel said in a statement.
Historical context
According to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, there were more than 526 government-funded and often church-run boarding schools across the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries, where Indigenous children were forcibly relocated; stripped of their traditional clothing, hair and personal belongings, and were beaten, starved or otherwise abused for speaking their Native language or acting in any way that might represent their traditional or cultural practices. 
The goal of these schools was to forcibly assimilate children into white American culture in an effort to dispossess tribal nations of their land.

The coalition has identified eight facilities in Michigan as part of its ongoing research. This includes St. Joseph Orphanage in Assinins, Baraga Chippewa Boarding and Day School, Catholic Otchippewa Boarding School in Schoolcraft County, Holy Childhood of Jesus School in Harbor Springs, Holy Family Orphanage in Marquette, Mackinac Mission School on Mackinac Island, Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School and New Mission House in Omena. 
Survivor voices and accountability
As part of its investigation, the Michigan Department of Attorney General is looking to speak with survivors, witnesses and individuals with firsthand knowledge about criminal acts that occurred at these institutions. They’ve encouraged individuals with information to reach out through email at AG-NBSInvestigation@michigan.gov or to call the investigation’s tipline at 517-897-7391, where tips can be left anonymously.
While criminal charges can be pursued if there is sufficient evidence, the department notes that prosecution may not always be an option if an offender has died, a living victim is unable to participate in the legal process or the statute of limitations has expired. However, the department has also committed  to memorializing the result of its investigation in a report that will be released to the public, while honoring culture and privacy.
Pain and resilience: The legacy of Native American boarding schools in Michigan

Nessel’s criminal investigation follows an initiative brought forth by then-Secretary of Interior Deb Haaland under former President Joe Biden’s administration working to provide a comprehensive review of the federal government’s Indian boarding school policies intended to eliminate Native American cultures through the forced removal and assimilation of Indigenous children.
In addition to identifying the names of boarding school facilities and sites, the initiative sought to identify the names and Tribal identities of children who were placed in these schools, identify the locations of marked and unmarked burial sites of children near these facilities and to collect Tribal and individual viewpoints on their experiences and the impacts of the Federal Indian Boarding School system.
Academic and community perspectives
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Tyler Dettloff, the director of the Center for Native American Studies at Northern Michigan University, said Nessel’s investigation could help provide justice for the families of individuals who attended these boarding schools.
The investigation also resonates with coursework at the university, Dettloff said, with Northern Michigan offering a class on the history of Indian boarding schools.
“I think it’s really exciting that we get this opportunity to see legal frameworks and Indigenous perspectives – especially informed by Native American studies disciplinary work – come to fruition at the state level and provide some healing for our communities,” Dettloff said.










Now is the time to be humble and ask the survivors and Tribes to lead the truth telling and reconciliation efforts.

The stories shared by survivors can help individuals and organizations like the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition put together a cohesive narrative of experiences and expose efforts to rewrite or downplay stories of mistreatment at these facilities, Dettloff said.
“These are overarching experiences that really expose some of the the inter-institutional intentions at committing genocide against Native American people,” Dettloff said. 
Nessel’s investigation could also help provide additional clarity and context to the history behind Native boarding schools, Dettloff said. It can also show the scope of a broad, intergenerational effort to eradicate Indigenous identity, he said.
While some of these schools closed more than 100 years ago, Dettloff explained that looking into these institutions can help document correspondences between school administrators, the federal government, and higher ups in the churches that ran the schools that show intention to commit acts of genocide.

“It’s not just individual teachers acting out against individual students,” Dettloff said. “These are directives given by administrators, directives given by elected leaders and directives given by the leaders of churches as well, to others who would carry out the acts of suppressing Indigenous identity through language suppression and other other means.”
Dettloff encouraged the Department of Attorney General to ensure that those who are sharing their experiences can do so in a safe, respectful and culturally appropriate manner noting that this was one of the ways the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada situated its investigations into Canada’s residential school system. 
The power of truth can be overwhelming, Dettloff said, and recognizing those truths while protecting and honoring those who come forward can help to lift that burden. She added that it’s also important to recognize these schools owe an  intergenerational, spiritual debt to survivors and their descendants.
Calls for reform and reconciliation
Leora Tadgerson serves as the director of reparations and justice for the Episcopal Diocese of Northern Michigan as a non-Christian, aiding in denominational policy reform and developing cultural competency workshops for churches to unpack Indian policy and how it relates to religious entities.
In an email exchange with the Michigan Advance, Tadgerson said Nessel’s investigation helps to give tribal people agency in their experiences and the legacy of boarding schools. 
“It offers the stakeholders (government and religious societies) the opportunity to do the right thing, and take care of their fellow human,” Tadgerson said. “Now is the time to be humble and ask the survivors and Tribes to lead the truth telling and reconciliation efforts.” 
Tadgerson said she hopes responsible institutions will open their archives willingly and unconditionally with full funding to aid in healing and restorative justice initiatives.
Additionally, Tadgerson said the investigation should go beyond the scope of crimes committed at Native boarding schools and look into the service infrastructure for these schools to ensure accountability.

“The reliving of these traumas need to turn into actionable policy recommendations to address the legacy for the state of MI,” Tadgerson said.

She advised the state to recognize its deliberate participation in the national Indian Boarding School policies, with an apology from the governor’s office issued as an executive order and accompanied by policies co-developed and approved by Michigan’s 12 Federally recognized Tribes.
Among other recommendations, Tadgerson called for a repeal of the state’s statute of limitations for sexual and physical abuse of minors, the inclusion of the boarding school era within the state’s academic standards, and to give tribes full access to identify and repatriated children who never returned from boarding schools, as the Native American Graves Protection & Repatriation Act does not apply to church grounds. 
Pointing to Northern Michigan University’s own class on boarding schools, Dettloff emphasized that students in a variety of fields could benefit from learning about their history and how they affect Native American experiences.
“I think there are some resonant effects that affect the ability of Native American students to learn at the same caliber as their non-Native peers,” Dettloff said. “And some of that might be internalized policies from schools,  It might be behaviors of teachers. It might be coming forth in other ways too representation or inclusion. But I will say that our mission statement here really does center around respectful inquiry around Indigenous issues and concerns.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-115001-1024x578.png,,,2026-01-16 07:56:49.091181

(File)The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled a lawsuit with an inmate who alleged that prison officials failed to deliver adequate medical attention for his toe, resulting in amputations to parts of his feet.
The terms of the settlement between Joseph Allen Renney and the ADOC were confidential. according to a news release published on Wednesday by the National Police Accountability Project, who represented Renney in his lawsuit.
“This settlement underscores the urgency of addressing systemic medical neglect within Alabama’s prisons—a crisis that courts, advocates, and investigative reporting have documented as widespread and ongoing,” said Lauren Bonds, one of Mr. Renny’s co-counsel and the Executive Director at NPAP.

A spokesperson for ADOC said “cases settle for several reasons, including but not limited to the rising costs associated with protracted litigation” abefore referring the matter to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office. A message was sent to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office on Thursday seeking comment.
According to the lawsuit, Renney, a diabetic, broke the big toe on his left foot in March 2021 while incarcerated at Limestone Correctional Facility after trying to move from a top bunk to a bottom bunk.
The lawsuit said Renney was given a gauze pad by medical staff to clean the wound and wrap it for seven days. The following month, the lawsuit alleges, he was taken to a podiatry facility where physicians recommended the amputation of the tip of his toe to prevent the spread of infection from an ulcer that developed at the injury site.
According to the lawsuit, the physicians at the podiatry clinic planned to schedule the surgery and seek approval for the procedure with ADOC.
The lawsuit said Renney went to the health care unit in Limestone at least three times from April to July of the same year to request that his wound be cleaned and treated with antiseptic. He waited for four to five hours each time to be treated due to understaffing, according to the lawsuit. Medical personnel working Limestone provided him with a gauze and told him to clean the wound himself.
The lawsuit states that the physicians at Limestone knew of the surgery that was planned because it was notated in his medical chart. The lawsuit also states that the physicians knew that his injury was not healing but was becoming more infected because “they personally observed the toe turning black and oozing pus and blood” when they examined him during his visits. The physicians did not administer antibiotics even though they had authority, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit also alleges that a corrections officer prevented the surgery from going forward in July 2021, on a day when Renney understood he would get the surgery. Renney eventually underwent surgery in October after waiting for several months, according to the lawsuit, but his condition had worsened to the point that his entire toe had to be amputated.
“If Defendant medical providers had promptly scheduled the surgery . . . instead of waiting six months until October 21, 2021, then Mr. Renney would only have needed to have the tip of his left big toe amputated instead of the entire left big toe,” the lawsuit states. “In addition, Mr. Renney would have been spared months of agonizing pain, continued infection in his left foot, and subsequent additional surgeries.”
Renney suffered a second injury after the surgery in February 2022, when he tripped while climbing stairs in Limestone. The injury was on his second toe, next to the big toe on the same foot that received the surgery.
All this happened while the big toe on his left foot, the site of the original injury, remained infected and spread to the more recent injury on his second toe.
Renney was given oral antibiotics to address the infection in March. He continued to visit the medical unit at Limestone in April. It was then that medical providers at the facility recommended that the big toe on this left foot be amputated. During a visit to a podiatry clinic in May,  the lawsuit said, the physician recommended that “that the top two “knuckles” of the second toe needed to be amputated to prevent the spread of infection and the risk of osteomyelitis.”  Despite the finding from the physician, the second surgery was delayed for several more months until the “the flesh and bone of the second toe had rotted off.”  Renney was eventually taken in for surgery in August.
Renney would receive his third surgery in October, this time to amputate the top of his left foot.

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Indiana lawmakers seek to align state law with a recently enacted federal ban on intoxicating and synthetic hemp products — over opposition from the burgeoning delta-8 industry.
The lengthy, complex legislation also would regulate less potent products that do pass legal muster.
But, “there’s going to be no demand,” for products under the proposed threshold, asserted Justin Swanson, representing the Midwest Hemp Council and 3Chi, a THC product retailer.
THC is the active ingredient in marijuana.

Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, confessed in committee Thursday that he’d rather “eliminate all these things from the planet, period,” but that his proposal “is what’s possible.”
His Senate Bill 250 would mimic Congress’ closure of what Freeman described as the “Farm Bill loophole,” referring to the 2018 legislation that defined legal hemp as any part of the plant containing less than 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight. That definition allowed products containing delta-8, THCA and other intoxicating cannabinoids to proliferate, including in Indiana.
A stopgap federal funding law enacted in November specifies that all forms of THC count. It also caps THC products to just 0.4 milligrams per container, and outright bans lab-made ones.
“I think (that) is what was intended by the federal government in 2018 when they first passed the Farm Bill; I think it’s what everybody had in mind when that language was then copied here in Indiana,” said Chris Daniels, the senior traffic safety resource prosecutor at the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council. “… The goal was very low potency THC.”
One industry group supported the changes.
“It is imperative that Indiana act during the 2026 legislative session to harmonize with federal policy,” said Cory Harris, representing the American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp. “Failure to do so will mean that Indiana’s policy will be less stringent than federal law, and therefore equate to Indiana being a legal cannabis market.”

The federal provisions are set to take effect in November. Freeman’s bill replicates those provisions, but sets an effective date four months earlier, in July.
“It’s premature for Indiana to codify federal law that will decimate an entire industry in the state,” Swanson said. “The landscape is still not settled.”
He noted U.S. Rep. Jim Baird — a Republican representing Indiana — filed a proposal pushing the federal ban’s effective date back to 2028. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order to speed up reclassification of marijuana as a less dangerous, less restricted drug.
Swanson said his clients do support a “responsible regulatory framework,” telling lawmakers that “the status quo is not acceptable for anybody.”
Freeman’s bill spends dozens of pages regulating the low-THC “hemp-derived cannabinoid products” that would be expressly legalized — notably, with a long-sought 21-plus age requirement.
It also puts Indiana’s Alcohol and Tobacco Commission in charge of regulating the industry that remains, implementing four types of permits for manufacturers, distributers, retailers and carriers. They’d be banned from advertising within 1,000 feet of schools, playgrounds and more, with retailers barred from operating within the same radius.
Retailers wouldn’t be able to deliver their products or let customers consume them on-site. The sale of products online would also be illegal — another sticking point for advocates.
Sun King Brewery CEO and Co-Founder Dave Colt said his homegrown company spent months and more than $100,000 dollars on equipment, research and development for its THC seltzers. Amid a nationwide downturn in alcohol sales, the seltzers have allowed Sun King to retain its staff and even grow.

“We also make products for at least a dozen small Hoosier businesses as well. Without this additional revenue, we would be forced to lay people off and dramatically downsize our business,” Colt testified. “We do believe strongly the industry wants clear regulations that meet consumer demand.”
Other provisions deal with containers, labeling and testing.
A fiscal impact analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency estimated a half-million-dollar financial hit annually to the ATC to administer and enforce the proposal. The agency will need to hire at least one additional excise officer in each of the six districts plus Marion County to investigate complaints associated with the new regulatory framework.
There will be additional expenditures for law enforcement training, purchases, and online databases, the analysis noted.
Costs could be offset from the permit and other fees collected. The measure would direct 70% of the earnings to ATC administrative efforts, 20% to enforcement work, 5% to the state’s 988 suicide and crisis hotline and 5% to the general fund.
If all tobacco sales certificate holders apply for a retail permit, for instance, their application fees would generate $2.1 million. If they’re all approved, the state would earn an additional $4.6 million, per LSA’s analysis.
The state’s seed commissioner would handle permitting for hemp growers and handlers.
Freeman also included a sentence preventing Indiana Code from immediately reflecting federal reclassification of marijuana, if that goes through.
Delta-8 regulations clear House but headed into negotiations

“This bill simply says that we would not automatically follow what the federal government does, that we would decide, 150 of us — that we would make that decision, not the federal government for us,” Freeman told his colleagues.
The Senate Commerce and Technology committee also consented to an amendment removing an excise tax, since any provisions raising revenue must begin in the House.
The revised legislation was approved on a party-line vote of 7-2, but it must next get through the finance-focused Senate Appropriations committee before heading to the chamber’s floor.
Previous efforts to both ban and regulate intoxicating hemp products have failed.
Asked about this year’s chances, Senate Republican leader Rodric Bray told reporters, “I don’t have that crystal ball,” but added, “I think the bill right now is in pretty good shape.”
“I think we’d just like, in Indiana, some certainty as to these products so that the people manufacturing and selling them know kind of what our laws are,” he continued, “and also to build in some really significant protections for, in particular, our youth across the state.”

Some people voted for this because they thought we would merely get a correction of former President Joe Biden’s failed immigration policy. They believed that the Trumpists would only go after the “the worst of the worst.” That was deeply misinformed. 
You barely had to scratch the surface to find the fascist philosophy undergirding the MAGA movement — not to mention the “Mass Deportation Now” signs that plastered the 2024 National Republican Convention. It’s all been laid bare by official government accounts sending out white nationalist messages in recent days, e.g., the Department of Homeland Security: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.”
In the face of the propaganda, chaos and crackpot despotism, regular Minnesotans haven’t lost their nerve, however. 
My favorite example is a woman named Nimco Omar quietly refusing when immigration agents asked for her papers.
“I’m U.S. citizen. I don’t need to carry around an ID. This is my home. This is my home. Minneapolis is my home. This is where I belong.” 
The visibly annoyed officers leave. 
I’ve watched it three times today. 
Be inspired by the irrepressible dignity of Nimco Omar, because here’s the thing: The people with power and influence in Minnesota are mostly going to be useless to us. 
You could find no better example than local pitchman Blois Olson, who represents corporate bosses in his PR business and sends out an email newsletter to many thousands of influential people in politics and business. Here’s what he wrote Thursday: 
“It’s not the loudest voices that deserve to be heard. Instead it’s the quiet voices that find reason and calm. That’s what we need today. This isn’t a moment for politics, it’s a moment for diplomacy — and diplomacy requires a lowering of the volume, a non-public effort and a sacrifice for peace at the expense of ‘being right.’” 
(Diplomacy is politics, but let’s move on.) 
Is he writing for Capitol lobbyists and upper-middle managers at UnitedHealth and Target, or for the ghost of Neville Chamberlain? 
“Peace for our time,” someone said on X, referring to Chamberlain’s infamous comments upon returning from the 1938 Munich conference when he caved to Hitler.
Although we should all strive for the stoic virtues and be strategic and levelheaded in our opposition — and eschew violence — it’s not a moment for “diplomacy.” 
The Trump administration has sent as many as 3,000 federal agents here; that’s nearly five times the total sworn officers in the Minneapolis Police Department. 
The Star Tribune reported Thursday that “Local attorneys are fielding dozens of complaints that ICE has wrongfully detained, threatened and physically abused bystanders amid the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown in Minnesota.” 
In an act of delicious timing, even as Olson was calling for diplomacy, President Trump was threatening to use the Insurrection Act, a 19th century law, to send in the military. (We’re already living amidst a paramilitary occupation, so I’m not sure it matters.)
It’s actually a moment for confrontation, both loud and quiet. And, for saying: No more. Take the mask off. Honor the Constitution. Better yet, leave. 
Think of Patty O’Keefe, who was profiled in this engrossing Reformer story. She spends her free time opposing ICE, tying up their resources by tailing and tracking them. In one haunting moment, federal officers approached her car door and said, “This is your one and only warning.” She courageously kept working at it, and spent all day Sunday in detention before being released without charges. 
By contrast, consider all the cowards who surrendered to the authoritarian attempt last year because they have beach house mortgages to think about: the big law firms, Big Tech, the corporate media. 
(To say nothing of the Republican Party, which has bent the knee for nearly a decade and makes a daily mockery of their decades of warnings about the threat of Big Government.)
And, locally, our biggest corporations have gone silent in the face of this federal assault. (Maybe they’re using their supreme powers of obsequious flattery, er, diplomacy, on Trump, in which case, bravo.) 
Though long protected by our liberal system and institutions, too many of our elites never really believed in liberal values like equality, pluralism and the dignity of every person, so when it came time to stand up, they were more than willing to cave to save their fancy lives. 
So yeah, it’s on us.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A man shelters alone under the heaters of a south Minneapolis bus stop on a cold January morning, the hood of a grey sweatshirt pulled over his thick dark hair. He unzips his black outer coat and looks down, apparently searching for something tucked into the other layers of clothing. 
He doesn’t see the SUV pulling up, or the masked ICE agent exiting the passenger side door.
The man turns around and looks at the federal agent as he approaches the bus shelter. The three glass walls surround him, and the agent stands on the open side, a full head taller than the man in the grey hoodie.
The man takes a small step back. The agent takes a step forward. 
The man and the agent pass something back and forth; then, the man produces a small square of printer paper from his pocket and unfolds it. The two look at the paper. 
Then, they walk together to the car. The agent opens the door to the backseat, and the man climbs in, unrestrained.
Across the Twin Cities, journalists, activists and influencers have taken to the streets to document the actions of the thousands of immigration agents that have flooded the state. Photographers have documented violent arrests, and livestreamers have broadcast clashes between protesters and agents, painting an authentic and repetitive scene of federal actions in Minnesota. 
But an untold number of immigrants, like the man in the bus shelter, have been arrested without the whistles and cameras — plucked out of their lives in an instant.
“Moments like this ultimately and quietly change how safe people, including myself, feel in their own neighborhoods,” said Garrett Gundy, whose home security camera captured the arrest.

Many immigrants in the Twin Cities are opting to shelter in place, or work from home if possible, given the number of immigration agents on the streets. ICE and Border Patrol agents are not only carrying out targeted raids, but also scanning the streets for people who may be immigrants, then asking those people to provide documentation; NPR captured video of agents approaching people of color charging their electric cars and asking each one to provide proof of legal residency. 
A lawsuit filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union alleges immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens.
Minnesota residents who oppose the immigration agenda of President Donald Trump have joined group chats with their neighbors so they can respond quickly to reports of ICE operations. But with the surge in federal officers arriving in the Twin Cities, ICE arrests have become quicker as agents avoid drawing a crowd.
At the bus stop, for instance, less than five minutes passed between the time the agent got out of the vehicle and when the man got in the backseat. 
Immigration officials say they have arrested at least 2,400 people since “Operation Metro Surge” began in December, according to NBC News. Deportation flights leaving MSP have increased from one or two per week in the summer of 2025 to two per day over the past week, according to Nick Benson, an anti-ICE activist who tracks deportation flights. 
“There are a number of people that are stuck at home, that fear for their lives because of what’s happening right now,” said Luis Argueta Jr., communications director for the immigrant rights organization Unidos MN.

Patrollers keeping eyes out for ICE have been monitoring immigrant-dense neighborhoods for signs of ICE activity. They film and protest the agents, and warn those nearby of immigration agents’ presence. Many have been stationing themselves around the clock at Mercado Central, which is home to dozens of Latino-owned businesses, hoping to make the workers and customers feel safe enough to do business.
When Argueta stopped at Mercado Central for lunch over the weekend, a business owner who knew him asked for help. She brought him upstairs, where Argueta saw two boys — one apparently about middle-school age and a young high-schooler — shaking and crying.
The brothers had been sheltering at home with their mother since the latest immigration enforcement surge began, but they were due for haircuts and were sick of being inside, Argueta said. 
Their mother dropped them off at Mercado Central with some money to get haircuts while she walked a short distance to cash a check, Argueta said.
She never came back.

Even though Argueta works at an organization that is tracking ICE arrests, he hasn’t been able to figure out what happened to the mother. Her children didn’t know her birth date, he said, and they would have to track that down before they could look her up in the database of immigrants in detention. Eventually, Argueta and others helped the brothers find the phone number for an aunt, who came to pick them up, with a bunch of other family members in tow.
Argueta has heard stories of arrests over and over. But he can’t get the two boys out of his head. 
“It was really tough to hear them talking and asking them questions that I would never imagine asking my own kids to answer,” Argueta said. “I just kept thinking, ‘Oh, my God, I’m asking them to grow up a little bit here and answer some really big, grown up questions.’”
It’s impossible to know how many other Minnesota children are left in similar situations when their parents are taken without warning.
Guntly, who recorded the video of the man apparently arrested by ICE at the bus stop, said he is encouraging more Minnesota residents to monitor public spaces in order to capture more of these quiet arrests.
The cameras capture other moments, too: his immigrant neighbors sprinting home from the bus stop, or hiding around the corner until they see the bus coming, while the heaters warm the empty shelter.

(IN.gov)I waffle between being annoyed by bills that are filed every year to designate some new state symbol or icon and finding them harmless ways to tout Hoosier individuality.
This year’s poster child is a move to make the breaded tenderloin the state sandwich.
Do we really need a state sandwich? No. And it does take up some legislative time to push one of these bills through a session. So far, the tenderloin bill has passed the Senate and is headed to the House.
Time will tell if it joins our list of state emblems.
The fact is, the number of state emblems has proliferated in recent years. We are way beyond a state tree (tulip), seal (bison leaping over a log) and flower (peony). We have 16 of these entities now, with six of them put into law since 2005.
State rifle. Check.
State aircraft. Check.
State snack. Check.
State fossil. Check.
A few years ago, there were attempts to add a state mammal and a state fruit, but they didn’t pass.
This proliferation isn’t just happening here in Indiana — other states have some crazy stuff on the books. I reached out to editors at our sister outlets around the nation and rounded up some examples.
Let’s start with New Mexico, which has both a state aroma and a related “state question.” I’m sure you are as curious as I was. New Mexico is the first state in the nation to have its own official aroma: green chiles roasting in the fall. The follow-up state question refers to the color of the chiles: “Red or green?”
Indiana’s state aroma? I’m going to go with manure or burning leaves. The state question would be, “IU or Purdue?”
Tenderloin takes a step closer to official Indiana state sandwich status following Senate vote

Next up is Missouri, which has the American bullfrog as its state amphibian and jumping jacks as the state exercise.
If these were adopted in Indiana, I envision the salamander — and playing HORSE in the driveway during twilight hours.
Michigan has a fascinating one: state soil. In 1990, Michigan declared Kalkaska sand as its official state soil. It’s relatively infertile, owing to its acidic nature, but nonetheless abundant, according to the Michigan Nature Association.
Based on my land, Indiana’s state soil could be clay.
My favorite comes next from Utah — a state cooking pot. And it’s none other than the Dutch oven. Utahns also have a state gem, which is topaz.
In Indiana, I would say the cast iron skillet could be our cooking pot. As for a state gem, I think the geode is the way to go. They are abundant and beautiful.
The last one I will highlight is currently under consideration in Kentucky. A Senate bill there would establish the Treeing Walker Coonhound as the state dog breed.
This could be testy here in Indiana, as dog lovers all believe their breeds are best. But I looked at the personality traits of various breeds and settled on a Labrador. They are known for being kind, friendly, outgoing and trusting. That sounds like a Hoosier to me.

But the update ended up causing more confusion about what patients can or can’t do, cannabis advocates say. 
In the FAQ section of Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services’ website, it lists the question: As a qualifying patient over the age of 21, can I choose to purchase marijuana as a patient and also purchase marijuana as a consumer?
Previously, the answer was a straight “no.” 
“…patient ID card holders are not allowed to purchase as a consumer in a licensed dispensary,” the department, which is Missouri’s cannabis regulatory agency, stated. 
The rule, regulators said, was meant to ensure that patients and consumers stay within their allowed possession limits.
But on Dec. 8, the department changed the answer to say they don’t exactly know.
It now says: “State law does not explicitly address the question of whether an individual may choose to purchase marijuana as a consumer once they have been approved as a patient and assigned a purchase and possession limit according to that status.”
The Independent asked DHSS if medical patients need to show their patient ID card every time they buy marijuana from a dispensary — a question the cannabis advocacy group Missouri NORML has urged the department to clarify.
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the department, said the law is “not clear” about it, “so DHSS is not instructing patients that they must do so,” in an email to The Independent. 
Dan Viets, an attorney and board member for Missouri NORML, said he’s pleased the department has changed its position on that question — but less so on another issue.
Viets initially interpreted the department’s update to mean that the state now agreed with NORML that medical patients may purchase the same amount of cannabis as other adult consumers.
In general, medical patients are limited to a 6-ounce allotment of dried, unprocessed marijuana every 30 days. Recreational consumers are allowed to purchase up to 3 ounces every day — but they can’t possess more than 3 ounces at any one time.
Cox said it is not the department’s position that “patients and consumers have the same purchase limits. These limits are different in law, and patient limits are often specific to each individual.”
She said “the law is clear” that individuals may not exceed purchase limitations by combining patient and consumer purchases. 
For recreational consumers, the state is prohibited by law from tracking their purchases without their permission. 
However by law, dispensaries are required to track how much medical marijuana patients buy so they don’t exceed their limit. And dispensaries are required to report to the department if they observe an individual exceeding their purchase or possession limits, which can lead to fines or criminal charges, the department’s website states. 
Cox said penalties for medical patients are uncommon, and the department has never had to revoke a patient card over possession limits. 
While there are some extra steps involved, Viets said there are good reasons for people to maintain their patient status.
“Not only because you pay less sales tax,” Viets said, “but I think more importantly, because you enjoy the constitutional protection against employment discrimination.”
Andrew Mullins, executive director of the Missouri Marijuana Trade Association, sent a letter in April to leaders of the Division of Cannabis Regulation claiming the previous FAQ wording was unconstitutional.
“We believe that DCR’s interpretation that a Missourian must either be an adult-use consumer or a medical patient is neither good public policy nor a constitutionally sound interpretation,” he wrote.
After the FAQ was changed online, MoCann Trade celebrated the revision.
“We are thankful that despite some initial confusion, it now appears that DCR agrees that medical marijuana patients can also exercise their purchasing rights as an adult use customer, so long as they abide by the possession limit,” Mullins told The Independent. 
He said it’s “especially significant” because Missouri has been increasing its patient count, reaching a two-year high in medical marijuana patient applications last month. 
“This pro-patient policy clarification,” he said, “now complies with the Missouri Constitution and addresses the concerns we previously articulated on behalf of our medical cannabis customers.”
Cox said the department is prohibited from tracking consumer purchases, “so it is largely up to individuals and dispensaries to ensure they are in compliance with the portion of this rule related to purchases.”
If there is a need to verify an individual’s possession limits, such as with law enforcement, “it is important that patients know the possession limits applicable to them.” 
The department, she added, will provide as much guidance as it can to patients and consumers on what is allowed so that they remain within their legal possession limits.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Andrew-Mullins-1024x785.jpg,,,2026-01-16 07:56:49.091181

(Photo by Mary Iuvone/New Jersey Monitor)
When the Legislature ended its 2024-25 session Monday with a marathon voting session, a number of high-profile bills never made it to a final vote.
Those include measures that would have created an official statewide definition of antisemitism, shielded patients and providers from liability for getting or giving health care related to gender dysphoria and gender incongruence, and targeted polluters by forcing them to pay fines to the state.
A bill that would have barred federal immigration agents from wearing masks, which Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill campaigned on last year, also failed to advance to a full vote, as did a much-discussed bill to ban smoking in Atlantic City casinos.
New Jersey aims to take over Lakewood schools

With a new legislative session underway — the state Assembly reorganized Tuesday with 12 new members — supporters of those bills must go back to the starting line and try to get them moved through legislative committees once again.
Assemblyman Gary Shaer (D-Passaic), who sponsored the antisemitism bill and pushed for the last two years to advance it, said there are a number of lessons to be learned.
“The most obvious and clearest of all is there needs to be better communication with leadership in the Assembly and the Senate and then the governor’s office, and hopefully, with that education and additional fine-tuning, we’ll find something that works for everyone concerned,” Shaer said.
The bill, which would have had the state adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, was opposed by critics who said it would have stifled criticism of Israel. But it had 59 sponsors in the Assembly, where at least 41 yes votes are needed for passage, and 17 in the Senate, where 21 votes are needed.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex), who controls what legislation makes it to a floor vote in the chamber, said the antisemitism bill was one of many “tricky bills” facing the Legislature in the last session.
“Making sure that you get the bill right — and as you all know, there were hours of testimony about that. There were free speech concerns, and making sure that we got the language right and getting everybody on the same page sometimes takes longer,” he told reporters Monday.
The transgender health care bill was nearly as popular with lawmakers as the antisemitism bill, with 39 Assembly members and 19 senators signing on as sponsors. The health care bill never even made it to a committee vote, though, dooming its chances.
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex), one of the bill’s prime sponsors along with Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), reintroduced the bill Tuesday. Its passage is one of her main priorities, she told the New Jersey Monitor.
“I’m looking forward to working with the new administration to get it to the finish line and protect human beings in the state,” Ruiz said.
Scutari told reporters Monday that he has to “pick and choose” what bills make it to a floor vote. He has said he wants to stick to a rule that limits the number of bills the Senate votes on during a given voting session to 30, though that rule is routinely waived.
“We can’t pass every bill, and we’ll be back next week anyway,” he said.
Sen. John McKeon (D-Essex) said he expects Sherrill to support his bill that targets polluters with fines, known as the “Climate Superfund Act.” The measure advanced through legislative committees but never saw a full vote despite intense lobbying by environmentalists who said it would make fossil fuel companies “pay their fair share.” McKeon reintroduced it Tuesday.
During the last legislative session, McKeon said of Sherrill, “the answer was consistently that they were big supporters of the Climate Superfund act, so I would hope that that wouldn’t change at all.”
Coughlin said legislative leaders, when considering what bills to advance, have to be mindful of action Washington, D.C., might take. The Trump administration has targeted states and private entities on issues related to health care for transgender people and immigration.
“So making sure we get that all right is really important,” he said. “Sometimes, you guys are pretty easy to criticize us for racing things through. You should be complimenting us for taking the time to be thoughtful on these things.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner).The Wisconsin Assembly — seeking to align state policy with Trump administration initiatives — passed bills Thursday to exempt overtime pay and tips from income tax. Lawmakers also passed bills to make English the official language of the state as well as school related bills.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) told reporters ahead of the session that his caucus was seeking to address affordability with the legislation, though Democratic lawmakers argued the bills would not help address the issue in an effective way.
AB 38 would implement an income tax exemption for cash tips paid to an employee that would sunset in 2028. President Donald Trump signed a law in July to allow workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their federal taxable income. Those earning more than $150,000 aren’t eligible for the deduction. 
The Wisconsin bill would apply the same policy when it comes to the state income tax. The deduction would apply to tips whether paid by cash or credit. 
Bill coauthor Rep. Ron Tusler (R-Harrison) said the tips tax cut is for the working and middle class. The bill passed 61-33 with a handful of Democrats joining Republicans. Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) and Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) abstained from the vote.
“Tips are primarily earned by the working class and the lower middle class and tips should never have been taxed. A tip is a gift, it’s not income,” Tusler said. “Tips are not mandatory; they are a way to say thank you to someone.”
Tusler told reporters that his legislation wasn’t permanent because legislators want to “watch and see how it works out.” 
“I think it would be a great idea for it to become permanent someday. I hope it does,” Tusler said.  
Tusler also called on the Department of Revenue (DOR) to “get to work right away” should the bill become law to ensure it has forms ready. 
“This bill is going to pass, and it’s going to get signed by the governor, but if the Department of Revenue doesn’t get ready for that, they will not have their forms ready for the tip earners come tax time. Those tip earners will wind up paying their taxes for 2025 and then they’ll have to refile their taxes to pay it to get their tip refund back. That’s not something we should be asking working-class and middle-class taxpayers to do.”
Evers told reporters Monday that he is open to looking at Republican proposals to eliminate taxes on overtime and tips but wants to consider more “universal” forms of tax relief. He has proposed property tax relief as well as exempting certain items from the sales tax including diapers and over-the-counter medications. 
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) tried to introduce an amendment to bring tipped employees, who can make a minimum wage of $2.33, up to the minimum wage of $7.25. He said it would’ve helped raise the standard of living for workers across the state. 
“Restaurant workers, hotel cleaners, bartenders, and too many other Wisconsin workers still rely on the inconsistent generosity of their customers just to survive. This is a terrible system that primarily benefits bosses and corporations – it’s also rife for abuse, leading to frequent unethical and sometimes illegal behavior like forced pooling of tips, assigning of non-tipped work assignments to tipped employees, and outright tip theft by bosses and managers,” Clancy said in a statement. 
His amendment was rejected by Republican lawmakers.
The Assembly also passed AB 461 in a 61-35 vote. It would create an income tax subtraction for certain overtime compensation. Single filers could claim up to $12,500 per year under the subtraction, while joint filers could claim up to $25,000. Unlike the “no tax on tips” bill, this policy change would be permanent.
Bill coauthor Rep. Paul Melotik (R-Grafton) noted that overtime work can be essential to communities and also take a toll on family life. He said the bill would help support the “hard-working people of Wisconsin, who put out extra effort… whether it’s nurses working double shifts, deputies filling in on weekends, line workers staying late to meet production goals or service employees keeping the doors open.  
Bill to make English the official language.
AB 377 would make English Wisconsin’s official language and allow state agencies to use artificial intelligence translation tools instead of providing an interpreter to people during court proceedings.
The bill passed 51-43. Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) voted with Democratic lawmakers against the bill.
Rep. Priscilla Prado (D-Milwaukee), who chairs the Wisconsin Hispanic Legislative Caucus, delivered her opposition to the bill in Spanish — telling lawmakers that after that they could “use Google to translate that.” Prado stood again later to deliver her remarks in English, saying she would help lawmakers out.
“You want to make it legal to use AI as a translator, which might be useful for ordering lunch, but certainly not sufficient for legal hearings, official forms and civil rights — not to mention that this implementation of AI would, quite literally, take jobs away from Wisconsinites who work as translators,” Prado said. “If efficiency were the goal, we would be talking about improving language access, not political symbolism. Wisconsin does not lose its identity because Spanish or another language is spoken. What it does lose is credibility when it ignores a substantial part of its population.” 
Rep. Nate Gustafson (R-Ormo) said he didn’t think the bill was stripping people of their identity, but would instead give people a “tool in the toolbox.” 
“It allows our legal system to move efficiently and forward instead of waiting on, let’s say, a limited pool of resources that aren’t there again,” Gustafson said. “We have declining birth rate. Our absolute workforce  is obviously diminished at this point, but we’re still reliant on people at the end of the day. There is a point where we need to give the people who are doing these jobs the tools to be more efficient.”
Bill coauthor Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville), speaking after Prado, said the speech represented a failure to communicate as most people in the Assembly did not understand what she said.
“One of the important things about having an official language for society is language draws people together, and I think it’s really important to give a society cohesiveness with people that speak the same language. Now, that doesn’t mean that this bill in some way makes it illegal, or you know, somehow, impeaches your ability to to speak another language, however  I think we are making a mistake here that if you speak English in the society — it’s a huge advantage to you.” 
School revenue and lunches
AB 457, coauthored by Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) and Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), would require Wisconsin school districts’ financial reports to the Department of Public Instruction on time before they are able to go to referendum. It passed 52-44 with Republicans for and Democrats against. 
The bill was introduced in response to Milwaukee Public Schools’ financial scandal where the district was months late in submitting financial documents to the state. The news was unveiled just weeks after voters had approved a historic referendum for the state’s largest school district.
Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) said that the bill was a “distraction” from other issues that school districts and property taxpayers are facing. 
Wisconsin taxpayers’ December bills included the highest increase since 2018. The increase followed  a controversial line item veto by Gov. Tony Evers , which extended a one-time increases to school revenue limits for the next 400 years. State  lawmakers did not provide additional state aid to schools, pushing many districts to use their additional taxing authority and others to go to referendum to ask local residents to raise their own taxes.
“The Department of Public Instruction is already working through any financial issues that they need to work through with the Milwaukee Public Schools,” Phelps said. “Educators and property taxpayers just are not buying the Republican spin. They can see the impact of what this building has done on the services in our public schools and their property tax bills, so it is frankly a waste of taxpayer-funded time for us to debate this silly bill that isn’t going anywhere.” 
Referencing the acronym for the school district, Nedweski called her bill the MPS bill — saying it  stood for “maximizing public scrutiny.” Nedweski said her bill is “straightforward” and would ensure that school districts are transparent before seeking to raise property taxes. 
“Public trust was shattered,” Nedweski said of the Milwaukee schools financial reporting failure. She also asked whether the outcome of the Milwaukee referendum would have been different if voters had known about the absent financial reports. 
“As property taxes continue to rise thanks to that 400-year Democrat property tax increase, it’s imperative that voters have complete information about the financial outlook of their school district before voting to further raise their own taxes,” Nedweski said. “This bill does not ask school districts to do anything new. It is not one new hoop they have to jump through… They are already supposed to be completing and submitting their financial information on time in accordance with state law.” 
AB 226 would prohibit Wisconsin public schools, independent charter schools, and private schools participating in a parental choice program serving meals that contain certain ingredients. Some of the food additives that would be prohibited include brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben, azodicarbonamide and red dye No. 3, which can be found in candy, fruit juices and cookies.
The bill is another instance of GOP lawmakers seeking to align state policies with Trump administration efforts.

(Courtesy photo)“Winter?  What winter?” asked the email from an old friend and life-long Montanan.  
Indeed, right now it’s still in the 50s here in Helena, in mid-January.  At night, the temperatures are not even making it down to freezing, often remaining in the 40s.  New high temperature records are being set across the state every week.  
“Winter?  What winter?” is a dang good question. 
Now maybe those who are new in-migrants to Montana — and there are many — this may seem like “really nice weather.”  And it is — for Spring, not winter in Montana.  
But for those of us who have lived here for all or most of our lives, seeing new high temperature records being set every week as the mountain ranges remain brown except for their summits, something like seasonal dislocation is occurring.  And it is not comforting because we know what’s coming — and it isn’t going to be pretty. 
The meteorologists say the Sno-Tel sites measuring snow depth at elevation are showing wide variation in accumulation — some say it’s good, some say they’re way low.  As an email from another old friend this week reported: “Snowmobilers say there’s good snow at 9,000 feet in the Tobacco Root Mountains.”  9,000 feet?!  That particular range tops out at 10,000 feet, so we basically have 1,000 feet of actual snowpack and then, well, it’s back to brown all the way down to the valleys below.
Bob Dylan famously sang “you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows” — and indeed, you don’t need a meteorologist to know there’s no snow in our mountains, you can trust your own eyes on that by just looking around. 
What this proves – undeniably and more evident every day – is that the environmentalists were right.  The predictions of the consequences of overloading the atmosphere with human-caused pollutants are now coming home to roost.  Those predictions have been on-going for many decades, and for many decades they have been largely ignored, distorted, and contested by, of course, those with a profit motive in continuing “business as usual” in the fossil fuel industries. 
Now, that position has been wholeheartedly adopted by a science-deficient president and the kow-towing toadies larding his administration.  Despite his proclamations that climate change is a “hoax,” the reality is staring us in the face here in Montana — and no amount of propaganda is going to bring down the temperature or produce the snowpack necessary to sustain Montanans through the ever hotter and drier summers. 
Tragically, not only has the fossil fuel industry been unleashed by removing what few regulatory sidebars once existed, the administration has adopted an absolutely insane policy of massive deforestation of what remains of our national forests.  
While billions are being spent on quixotic quests to engineer huge machines to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, those forests and their green trees achieve that job by not only removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but safely sequestering it in the soil.  And they do it for free — if we simply let them live.
Unfortunately, Montana’s governor is equally misdirected by trying to log as much of our state forests as possible, even kicking up the supposed “sustainable yield” by millions of board feet every year when there’s no guarantee that they will regrow in the changing climatic conditions. 
The environmentalists were right and remain right, and many continue the struggle to try to save something for generations yet to come.  The weather?  Nice for April, not January, in Montana — where the old hands, who know better, are asking, “Winter? What Winter?”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Canyon-Ferry-0115-e1768534788156-1024x821.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 06:56:36.700142

DemasThe transition team of Detroit Mayor Mary Sheffield is asking residents, from every neighborhood, about their thoughts on long-term priorities that might shape her administration.
Sheffield’s Rise Higher Detroit survey, launched last week but released Wednesday, is being billed as the largest community survey effort in the city’s history. The city said the form will remain open for two months and will inform the mayor’s first-year priorities and strategies, with the aim of reaching those who have been historically left out of the decision making process.
“This survey reflects the commitment I made throughout my campaign and my career in public service to listen and govern alongside the people of this city,” Sheffield said in a statement. “Detroiters deserve a government that is shaped by their voices, their experiences, and their priorities and this survey is one way we’re turning that commitment into action.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The survey is available online but also can be filled out in person through community canvassing partners that will be around the city or at upcoming city events. Sheffield’s team is also partnering with Detroit Action, MI Poder and the Eastside Community Network to lead the on-the-ground effort. The surveys will be further available to residents at grocery stores, churches and other community spaces.
A series of community events are planned through February where residents can engage with Sheffield and her transition co-chairs, focused on priority topic areas.
The efforts six priority areas include: Thriving neighborhoods, safe and just communities, reliable transportation and sustainable infrastructure, equitable economic and workforce development, robust education and youth opportunities, and open and accessible government.
Cindy Gamboa, the executive director of MI Poder, said the organization was proud to step up to assist Sheffield’s new tenure, “ensuring the opinions, concerns and voices of all Detroiters are heard.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_9053-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 06:56:36.700142

For many, the recent holiday season was a time to connect with family. For some, family includes someone incarcerated in one of Wisconsin’s prisons or jails. 
Juli Bliefnick told the Wisconsin Examiner she was incarcerated in county jail and state prison from January 2012 to June 2016. She said that many people would save up precious telephone time to call their families for the holidays. 
“People that came from more disadvantaged backgrounds would not call their families as often,” Bliefnick said.
She remembers the cost of calls putting strain on her relationship with her parents while she was incarcerated. 
While incarcerated, Ventae Parrow said he had to choose whether to spend his money on additional food items and hygiene, or on talking with family on the phone. Parrow left prison in 2020 and is an organizer for the advocacy network WISDOM. He told the Examiner that how often he talked to his family depended on how much money he had.
Nationally, jail and prison phone call rates have declined over the years, according to a report covering 2008-2021 from the Prison Policy Initiative. And in 2024, the Federal Communications Commission voted for new rules to lower how much calls could cost.
The agency announced that for the overwhelming majority of people, the upper limit on the per-minute cost of calls would drop by over half. New per-minute caps ranged from 6 cents per minute for prisons to 12 cents per minute for very small jails.
However, the agency postponed aspects of the new rules in June, including the 2024 caps, until April 2027. Then the FCC voted in the fall of last year to partially roll back the 2024 change with new caps. The commission voted to increase the caps on the cost of a minute on the phone partway back to the caps that preceded the 2024 rules. The new caps range from 11 cents per minute for prisons to 19 cents per minute for extremely small jails. The FCC called them interim caps, and said it was seeking comment on how to establish permanent caps.
Worth Rises, a group advocating for lower rates, said the 2025 revised caps will deliver substantially less financial relief to families affected by incarceration. They will take effect April 6 barring further action.
In northeastern Wisconsin, people incarcerated in the Brown County Jail currently pay a per-minute rate of 15 cents for phone calls, Captain Heidi Michel told the Examiner. They receive two free phone calls and two free messages per week.
Michel said the jail’s average daily population for 2025 was 661 people, which meets the FCC’s definition of a medium-sized jail. The 2025 caps will require jails of this size to have rates of 12 cents per minute or less. Under the 2024 rules, medium-sized jails would have to abide by a lower rate — 7 cents per minute or less — and therefore charge incarcerated people and their families less money.
The 2025 caps also allow for people to be charged higher rates for video calls than the 2024 rules. Michel said people incarcerated in the Brown County Jail can have video visitation for 18 cents per minute. A medium-sized jail can have this rate under the 2025 caps for video calls. However, the 2024 caps would have required a rate of 12 cents per minute or less.
FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said rules the commission adopted in 2024 resulted in “serious, unintended consequences.” He said that limiting how facilities could recover safety and security costs through phone call charges caused some correctional facilities to scale back or even stop offering calling services.
The Baxter County Sheriff’s Office in Arkansas announced that the phone system used at the Baxter County Detention Counter would soon no longer be available due to the regulations. Two companies claimed to the FCC in April that its 2024 order was forcing correctional facilities to end or reduce access to services, and that the two companies were forced to end service to a few facilities.
Commissioner Anna Gomez, who dissented in the rollback of the 2024 rule change, said the commission took “narrow and speculative” concerns and granted a waiver of the entire 2024 decision. She also raised the idea that the commission could have considered an individual waiver of the 2024 caps for facilities that showed that having less revenue led to communication services being unavailable.
Gomez called the FCC’s order indefensible, saying it would implement “an egregious transfer of wealth from families in incredibly vulnerable situations to monopoly companies that seek to squeeze every penny out of them.”
Wanda Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative told the Examiner that according to the FCC, the caps were calculated to offset the cost of companies offering certain features to jails and prisons, such as call monitoring. In an interview, Bertram argued that call monitoring technology should not be funded by fees charged to incarcerated people and their families. 
Call costs for Wisconsin jails and prisons
The cost of a phone call varies across facilities. In the Eau Claire County Jail in western Wisconsin, incarcerated people pay 9 cents per minute on the phone and receive two free phone calls a week, Security Services Captain Chad Dachel told the Examiner. For the Polk County Jail, the rate is $0.19 per minute, and incarcerated people are allowed two free calls per week, according to Sheriff Brent Waak.
As of late 2021, the average cost of a 15-minute call from a local jail in Wisconsin was $3.00, according to a Prison Policy Initiative report.
In a statement to the Examiner, Mark Rice of WISDOM called for making prison and jail phone calls free for all. The effects of this would include reducing the financial challenge for families and improving the mental wellbeing of affected people, he wrote. The Prison Policy Initiative has argued that family contact also reduces recidivism.
In November, lawmakers and organizers announced a package of bills aimed at improving conditions in prisons and jails, including the affordability of communication, the Examiner reported.
ICSolutions, telephone service provider for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC), charges 6 cents per minute for calls at the department’s adult facilities, DOC communications director Beth Hardtke told the Examiner, as of late December. ICSolutions charges 1 cent per minute for calls made at juvenile facilities and continues to charge $2.50 for a 25-minute video visit or $5 for a 50-minute visit, according to Hardtke.  According to reporting from the Examiner in 2024, a family member of a man incarcerated at Fox Lake Correctional Institution said people receive two free calls every Sunday. Three free weekly messages are provided, according to the department’s website.
People incarcerated in jails and their families have tended to experience higher phone rates than those in prison, according to the Prison Policy Initiative report covering 2008-2021. Under the caps the FCC passed in 2024, the DOC’s 6-cent rate would still have been allowed; that’s a 15-minute rate of 90 cents In 2021, the average 15-minute rate for a jail phone call was roughly $3.
However, ICSolutions is required to pay the department a commission of 4 cents per minute for all calls at adult institutions. The FCC decision includes a ban on site commissions, which critics say inflate call costs. The ban will take effect on April 6. 
Will the commission ban affect state prisons?
Under state law, two-thirds of the phone commission from the contract must go to the Department of Administration, according to Hardtke. One-third goes to DOC and must be spent on services that “directly benefit” incarcerated people.
In September 2024, Hardtke told the Examiner that ICSolutions paid nearly $6.3 million in commission in fiscal year 2024. The Department of Corrections’ share was nearly $2.1 million. 
Hardtke said that “the commissions received allow DOC to purchase the following in support of the persons in our care,” and provided a list of items ranging from mail processing services to re-entry portfolios to art supplies. 
It’s unclear whether the FCC’s commission ban will affect prisoners’ ability to access items and services currently funded by  the commission money, or if other funding will sustain those items and services. However, $2.1 million is a tiny fraction of the Department of Corrections budget, and the commission money may not account for all of the funding supporting each item or service Hardtke listed. Hardtke said the Department of Corrections is continuing to evaluate how to best continue services to the Wisconsin prison population.
Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative said that charging people higher phone rates shouldn’t be the source of money for things like free video calls that benefit incarcerated people.
The decision leaves some room for authorities to receive money from phone calls. Within the new FCC caps, a portion of up to 2 cents per minute exists “to account for the costs correctional facilities incur in allowing access to (communication services).” 
Bertram told the Examiner that an example of this would be time spent by a correctional officer to escort people to a phone bay. The FCC said this was an interim measure while it sought comment for a permanent version. 
Hardtke’s full list of items that receive funding from the commission was: “mail processing services, driver education simulation equipment, recreation equipment, exercise equipment, library resources, TVs, cable TV, art supplies, re-entry portfolios, puzzles, yarn, activity books, CD/DVD players, movies, dayroom microwaves, incentive prizes, visiting room toys/activities, media credits, dayroom newspapers, magazine subscriptions, modern technology improvements and services, bus tickets for release, dayroom ice machines, personal laundry washing machines and repairs, barber services, religious and chapel supplies and services, legal loans, lanyards, burial/cremation for unclaimed bodies, dayroom game tables, dayroom board and card games, graduation ceremonies expenses, and more.”
Before the rollback in October, the FCC postponed its rate cap rules in June. In a November interview, Bertram said she’d already heard from families about the cost of connection going up in the wake of the loss of the 2024 caps. 
“This is going to come as a shock to a lot of families who had gotten a lot of relief from the 2024 rules,” Bertram said.

Said Arch: “Sometimes it’s extremely difficult to know, Where is the door? How do you actually find the opportunity to trade into the European Union? This is what Ireland is offering to us. They can help facilitate that.”
Plus, there’s the cultural bond. Roughly 12% of Nebraskans claim Irish roots.
“We have a lot of Irish people in Nebraska, a lot of descendants, a lot of heritage,” Arch said in an interview alongside Daly. “It’s a natural fit.”
If Legislative Bill 1087 passes, Nebraska would join 25 other states that have formed similar commissions with the “Emerald Isle” nation on the western edge of Europe, said Arch, who introduced the bill on Thursday.
 Ireland, big U.S. investor

Huskers without Irish ancestry also would reap job and economic growth benefits, said Arch, himself not among the Irelanders. Arch said he’s been a fan of the partnership since meeting Daly in Ireland at a conference a few years ago.

He recalled that international trip, and a visit to a university in Cork.  There, Arch heard a researcher mention a tie to the University of Nebraska, which underscored already forming pathways between the countries. 
“It was like, what? I went over to him afterwards, and it was agricultural related, they were collaborating on research in agriculture,” Arch said.

Ireland itself has a population of more than 5 million. State commission members gather annually in Dublin, said Arch, creating relationships and opportunities.
Said Daly: “Politics and diplomacy is like American football — it’s a contact sport and you put people in the room, and that’s how you create ideas and new opportunities.”
 Two-year terms

Under LB 1087, the new commission would include representatives from the Nebraska Departments of Agriculture and Economic Development. The governor would appoint members from a Nebraska university, business associations and nonprofits. A state lawmaker from each congressional district, appointed by the state Legislative Council, would serve as nonvoting members.
Two-year appointees would meet at least once quarterly, and, according to the bill, would not be paid except possibly for expense reimbursement if funds were available.
Arch foresees private fundraising and outside grants largely fueling a support fund the bill would establish. It is to be administered by DED. He said the bill would not trigger any state funding appropriation. 
A hearing on LB 1087 will be scheduled for the public to weigh in.

Arch drew a distinction between a proposed Nebraska-Ireland Commission and more typical state trade missions led by the governor or other state executives and business leaders. He said those overseas mission trips generally focus on strengthening a particular industry.
“This is much more the forming of relationships that will show us where those opportunities are,” he said. “We will discover opportunities that we had no idea — that were not preconceived.”
While in Nebraska Wednesday and Thursday (not his first visit), Daly attended the State of the State address and toured Omaha’s Boys Town, founded in 1917 by Father Edward Flanagan, who hailed from Ireland’s Roscommon. 
Daly, a senator in Ireland’s upper house since 2007 and the second-youngest person to serve as chair, said the mayor of his home county frequents the popular St. Patrick’s Day celebration in O’Neill, Nebraska. 
“We have connections that go back through the generations,” he said. “What we’re looking at here is creating new connections into the future.”

The court heard arguments Thursday from attorneys for Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group and security contractor Universal Protection Service, who maintain the lawsuit should be dismissed because such attacks can’t be foreseen.
The lawsuit in question was filed in 2024 involving Kaya Stewart, who was shot in the leg, and her younger sister, who just missed being wounded at the mall just south of Indianapolis.
Their attorneys assert that Simon and Universal were negligent in not providing adequate security, allowing the gunman to enter carrying a large backpack containing several weapons and spend more than an hour in a restroom before the attack.
Three people were killed in the July 2022 shooting before an armed bystander opened fire and fatally shot the gunman.
Family questions security
Gabriel Hawkins, an attorney for the Stewart family, told the justices that the victims should have the right to further investigate the mall’s security actions as the gunman walked through areas covered by at least a dozen video cameras.
“We know that these cameras were being monitored.” Hawkins said. “This is not a backpack that my son would carry to his high school. This is a backpack with a long extension specifically designed to carry assault rifles.”
A Marion County judge and the Indiana Court of Appeals have rejected attempts by Simon and Universal to dismiss the Stewart lawsuit on procedural grounds. 
Wrongful death lawsuits filed by the families of those killed in the shooting — married couple Pedro Pineda, 56, and Rosa Mirian Rivera de Pineda, 37; and Victor Gomez, 30, all from Indianapolis — are on hold until the Supreme Court decides whether the Stewart lawsuit may proceed.
State’s gun laws also raised
Simon Property Group attorney Michael Limrick argued that Indiana trial rules don’t allow a lawsuit to proceed in an instance where the defendants couldn’t have foreseen something like a mass shooting happening.
Michael Limrick, an attorney for Simon Property Group, argues before the Indiana Supreme Court on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. (Screenshot from court’s livestream)
“Just seeing someone with a backpack walking into a mall, I don’t think anybody can then make the leap to say that’s putting everybody on notice that a mass shooting is about to occur,” Limrick said.
Justice Christopher Goff asked the mall attorney about whether the security contractor should take steps to recognize someone as a potential shooter.
“I don’t think the court wants to slip into the mode of judicially sanctioned profiling, so I have a concern about that,” Limrick replied.
He then pointed to an Indiana law that generally allows people to openly carry guns in public places.
“We say that folks can walk down having a semi-automatic rifle out in the open,” Limrick said. “If the public policy of the state is that that’s OK, then how do we then flip it around and say that anytime somebody is exercising their statutory rights and they step into your business, you’re now obligated to assume they’re going to start shooting. I don’t think we can square that.”

The legislative panel proposing to defund the economic development shop wants to shuffle some programs to other state agencies. 
The post Lawmakers advance bill to dismantle Wyoming Business Council despite governor’s office objections appeared first on WyoFile .","The Legislature’s primary budgeting arm haggled over and then passed a 58-page draft bill on Thursday to dismantle the Wyoming Business Council after the measure was shared with Joint Appropriations Committee members, and the public, for the first time the night before.
The pace at which the panel moved drew a strong rebuke from a key adviser to Gov. Mark Gordon, who at one point bluntly told the committee, “This is nuts.”
Draft bill, “Wyoming business council-repeal,” passed by a vote of 9-3. Devils Tower Republican Sen. Ogden Driskill, Jackson Democrat Sen. Mike Gierau and Laramie Democrat Rep. Trey Sherwood voted against the measure. The bill will be introduced in the Senate when the full Legislature convenes in February for the budget session. 
Gierau made a motion to table the bill in favor of prioritizing the matter as a topic to hash out after the budget session. The motion failed.
The bill, brought by Powell Republican Sen. Dan Laursen, attempts to prescribe how the business council will be dismantled and to codify the committee’s action earlier this week to defund the agency, which also passed on a vote of 9-3 along the same division.
Though both the budgeting action and repeal bill will get a hearing before the full Legislature, proponents of the effort to dismantle Wyoming’s primary economic development agency heard criticism for the breakneck speed of the effort, as well as what’s been described as an unprecedented and monumental move to eliminate a major state agency.

“We don’t know what the ramifications are,” Gierau said after several hours of debate. “I mean, this bill, in my view, is fatally flawed. That’s why I asked that we put together a task force to try to make it right.
“I hear this, ‘Oh, get the government out of the way’ [argument],” Gierau continued. “I have yet to hear one positive thing that’s come out of this about how we’re going to help business. If you think that passing this bill is going to mystically help everything out just by passing it, I think you’re fatally misguided.”
Though he voted for both measures, Wheatland Republican Rep. Jeremy Haroldson also expressed concern about the short timeline the Legislature has to decide how to hand off multiple accounts and programs under the business council’s management to other state entities.
“I also heard the Wyoming Business Council has done nothing good,” Haroldson said. “I disagree with that. I think there have been good things that have come out of this. You guys, honestly, with this conversation, it makes an incredibly large discussion point going into the next [legislative session] because a lot of this is politics.”
Proponents, including Sheridan Republican Rep. Ken Pendergraft, argued that dismantling the economic development agency stands to benefit businesses.
“This is nuts. This is crazy. You’re attempting to [eliminate] an agency that has been around for over 20 years and what appears to be a rushed bill. It appears to have a lot of questions.”Randall Luthi, Gov. Mark Gordon’s office
“The concept, the underlying idea behind this, is to get government out of the way and allow businesses to find their own way and work for themselves, to survive on their own,” he said.
Reshuffling the deck
The bill to dismantle the business council prescribes where to transfer accounts, how to administer active loans, which programs under the council will be terminated and where other programs might be reassigned among various state agencies.
For example, the Main Street and Small Business Investment Credit programs would be eliminated, while others would be transferred to agencies such as the Wyoming Office of Tourism, Wyoming Workforce Services and Wyoming Energy Authority. The Wyoming Broadband Office, currently under the business council, is managing some $400 million in federal funds. That work would be shifted to the governor’s office.
None of those agencies, according to Legislative Service Office staff, have been consulted about how or whether they can handle the new duties.
Sherwood noted that, if the bill passes, the Legislature is essentially asking the council’s staff of 38 full-time workers and two part-time workers to dismantle the organization, knowing that their jobs are being eliminated. 
“Have we contemplated what happens if they all walk on day one — that this bill is signed and then, who is left to do this work?” Sherwood asked.
Though the pre-markup version of the bill didn’t contemplate a severance package, several members suggested that such an offering could help ensure employees’ cooperation to dismantle the organization.
“This is nuts. This is crazy,” Gov. Mark Gordon’s Policy Director Randall Luthi told the committee. “You’re attempting to [eliminate] an agency that has been around for over 20 years and what appears to be a rushed bill. It appears to have a lot of questions.
“There is a way to go through each and every question that you have and be able to find a home for where things might go or where we no longer need them,” Luthi added.
Gordon’s Communications Director Amy Edmonds reiterated to WyoFile that the governor will continue to defend his budget recommendation to fund the council into the future.
“We don’t believe [the defunding effort] has had the full vetting of the people in the state,” Edmonds said. “It’s just not how we do things in Wyoming. This should be done fully noticed with multiple opportunities for the public and other entities to come and to speak on it.”
The Legislature will convene Feb. 9.

People will continue to leave Wyoming unless our leaders trade in tired tradition for policies that nurture growth, writes columnist Jessica Brauer. 
The post Familiar soil isn’t guaranteed to be fertile appeared first on WyoFile .","“You cannot ignore this problem any longer, “ then Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan said in a 1989 State of the State Address to the 50th State Legislature. “We are losing valued employees and faculty, and those that remain are finding it increasingly difficult to find loyalty, love of Wyoming, and personal ties enough to keep them here.” 

Opinion

This grim forewarning to Wyoming’s people, made just months before I was born, holds true. Whether by way of regressive policies, stagnant professional opportunities, depleted resources for health and safety or the unaffordability of homes in our beloved communities, our neighbors are leaving — just as Sullivan declared 37 years ago. 
Our state’s struggle to retain its residents is no mystery. It’s the predictable result of tired choices made by lawmakers decade after decade. We’re on the precipice of them doing it again. 
The Wyoming Business Council, the state’s economic development arm, recently presented lawmakers with data showing steady economic decline, stagnant job growth and shrinking wages. The state’s exodus of residents is the worst in the country at twice the national average. 
But rather than unanimously applauding the Business Council for seeking solutions, there are state legislators who, in the upcoming budget session, want it defunded. 
Quite frankly, I question the sanity of those of us who opt to stay, myself included. 
My family planted roots in Casper, a place hardened by a petroleum-fed cycle of feast and famine, long before I came into the world 36 years ago. It bred tough people. In the late 1980s, the state of our state was dismal on the periphery of a devastating bust, and I came quietly into a roughneck town. Here, Wyoming weasled its way into my bones, and I grew devoted to it, for better or worse.  
I learned that the desire to leave Wyoming was itself a rite of passage. Across state lines was the opportunity to stretch through experience — to hear new stories, to ride escalators, to eat vegan food. The elders would boast of the children sowing their wild oats in the city, their starched denim replaced with pressed suits. 
Wyoming high school grads share excitement about a world beyond the four plumb walls of our familiar square state. Stacks of dorm-sized belongings accumulate for our leap from the nest. Grand illusions of far-flung adventure aside, I hauled my mini fridge and big dreams just 150 miles south to Laramie — Wyoming’s beloved town of brown and gold.
The University of Wyoming, one of the few anchors for young people in the state, is also in the crosshairs of the Legislature’s zealous budget cutters.
My time there extended my departure, but I eventually would leave, along with most of my friends.
As I stayed rooted in Laramie, I too believed that our state’s precious minds would return after their time away, bringing expanded worldviews and fuller pocketbooks with them. Yet, through the years, the goodbyes have far outnumbered the welcome homes.
One of Wyoming’s premier exports is its educated young people, who leave to neighboring states in more of a gush than a trickle. A Harvard Growth Lab study identified that by the time people born in Wyoming reach their 30s, nearly two-thirds have left. Why did they leave? Ask former Gov. Sullivan or the Business Council or the Harvard researchers. Prohibitive house prices, a dearth of quality job opportunities and subpar services and amenities make it hard to stay. 
Yet, Wyoming has a way of tugging us back by our bootstraps. My youthful thirst for broadened horizons took me from city to ocean, only to find my mind most comforted by a return to the wide open West. However, familiar soil isn’t guaranteed to be fertile.
I fell victim to Laramie’s fabled ailment: the boomerang effect. 
In 1881, a jack of many trades, Edgar Wilson “Bill” Nye, took the lead of the new-to-town newspaper, which he named after his trusty mule. Nye said the thing about Boomerang was that he had a knack for wandering, but he always came back. 
As a mule hungry for feed or a night’s rest away from the elements of the high plains, it’s no surprise that Boomerang kept coming home to Laramie. The question is, what made him wander from his companion’s care? Did Boomerang know greener pastures were just down the road, too?
The data shows, however, that the boomerang effect may only live on in Nye’s hooved pet. Growth Lab reports show residents leave the state at a young age, and most do not return in the years thereafter — contrary to the charming legacy. Rather, the exodus only grows. Older born-and-raised Wyomingites live outside the state at increasing rates — an all-too-familiar fallout of declining access to affordable medical care and services for senior citizens.
Instead, good legislation for Wyoming’s people keeps meeting its end at the Capitol steps while the lawmakers grandstand about how we’re resilient, how it’s not government’s role to lend a hand or produce solutions to generations-old problems.
Wyoming’s resilience is undeniable — look at how our trees bend with the wind. But gutting programs that invest in our communities, support our entrepreneurs and plan for our economic future isn’t an act of courage, nor defiance against anyone but your own. It’s negligence. To turn a blind eye to the needs of Wyoming’s people is, and was always, the wrong choice, even if we’re rugged. 
I dream of a state that listens to Sullivan’s plea and sees itself as deserving of nurturing from thoughtful change-makers, not a stubborn adherence to tired tradition.

Our state faces important challenges when it comes to keeping our young people, maintaining local services and supporting our health care system, writes columnist Khale Lenhart.
The post Wyoming faces critical questions in 2026 appeared first on WyoFile .","A new year is a natural time for reflection and looking ahead. This year promises to be another important one for Wyoming, with a major statewide election and big decisions to be made about our state’s future. Looking ahead to the coming year, what are some of the major political issues we are likely to see debated?

Opinion

One key issue that will be at the forefront of many debates is what we should expect of local and county governments. Last year, the Wyoming Legislature instituted significant cuts to funding for local and county governments. Just one year in, we have seen counties and municipalities dipping into reserves to make ends meet, programs shutting down and services ending. This will only continue as reserves run out and local elected officials must make decisions on where to spend fewer and fewer dollars. 
We will see whether the people of Wyoming approve of this new style of government as roads deteriorate, infrastructure like sewer and water goes without necessary maintenance, and local services like parks, street plowing, libraries and senior centers are defunded.. Local government is often the most responsive and most impactful for our day-to-day lives, but current trends point to less local control and more power being concentrated in the state capital in Cheyenne. Expect this debate to continue.
Access to quality and affordable health care is also likely to be a major issue. Wyoming has unique challenges in this area, as our large state, low population and dispersed cities make it difficult to provide access to necessary health care across the state. We simply do not have the population base to support the full range of necessary services in all communities. Some hospitals in smaller population centers have already stopped providing vital services. For example, cities like Evanston, Rawlins, Wheatland and Kemmerer have seen their hospitals close or pause inpatient maternity services, leaving these communities without a place where expecting mothers can have their children. They must now drive to other communities, sometimes hours away, to receive necessary care. Determining how to provide health care, especially in rural communities, in a way that is economically viable for both the providers and patients, is a massive issue that we have not made much progress on yet. As our population ages, this issue is likely to become more and more urgent.
Education is also likely to be at the forefront of many debates. Our state constitution requires the Legislature to fund a top-quality education, although the question of how and what should be included is a matter of significant debate. The Wyoming Supreme Court is considering two cases that are likely to have major implications on the future of education in Wyoming, as it decides whether the state can issue direct payments to parents for non-public education and whether the state has adequately funded our public system. Regardless of the outcome of these cases, public schools in Wyoming still must provide education in an ever-changing environment. Education is the single largest expense of our state budget and will undoubtedly demand major attention. 
Perhaps the greatest question for the long-term outlook of our state is how we stem the tide of outmigration of our young people. We are an attractive state for retirees or those who have already built a career or business, but we fall behind when it comes to those starting professional life. The answer is not just low taxes. If that were the case, we would be in great shape, as our tax burden is among the lowest in the nation. We must decide to do something more to build places where families are confident they can prosper. Quality careers, access to amenities beyond just our outdoors, the education, health care and community infrastructure that gives people confidence that they can meet their necessary needs at home. All of these are areas that require attention and are likely to be major issues of public debate in the coming year.
All these topics have a common thread. They all wrestle with the question of what our state looks like in the future and what type of lives our fellow citizens will lead. We must decide whether we want prosperity or whether we want to hold fast and watch the society around us wither away. Most voters do not spend their time following legislative debates or subscribing to political dogma. They want to live good lives, provide for their families and feel like they are making progress. Political decisions can make all the difference when it comes to how our families and communities operate. Let’s hope that all of us, citizens and officials alike, recognize the importance of finding the right solutions to the questions ahead.

On Thursday, Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, and Sen. Dave Lent, R-Idaho Falls, told the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee about the shortage of doctors and presented recommendations from the state’s Undergraduate Medical Education Plan Working Group. 
Overall, Manwaring called for state legislators to support and expand the state’s medical education program and seats, arguing that future medical professionals who train in Idaho will be more likely to practice medicine in Idaho. 
“We can’t go backwards,” Manwaring told the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee.
Recommendations from the report include:

Idaho must maintain undergraduate medical education capacity, both through the Idaho WWAMI program partnership with the University of Washington, as well as with the University of Utah.
Grow new undergraduate medical education capacity through University of Utah and Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine.
Increase graduate medical education capacity, particularly for rural Idaho.
Support a new office at the Idaho State Board of Education to coordinate and expand clinical placements and preceptors. 

Manwaring estimated it would cost $350,000 to $485,000 this year to expand undergraduate medical education by 10 seats. He said it could also cost another $350,000 for the new office to coordinate clinical placements. 
Rep. Rod Furniss, R-Rigby, asked about funding additional incentives, such as repayment of medical school debt. Last year, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee zeroed out a request from Gov. Brad Little to expand the Rural Physician Incentive Program, which provides $25,000 a year to help physicians who are practicing in areas facing health care shortages repay their medical school debt.
“Again, it’s about what are we willing to pay for?” Manwaring said. “Those incentives do work but we have to pick and choose and prioritize how much we can incentivize and how much we do it. But there is no question that works.”
This year every dollar of state funding is going to be tight. Idaho’s state budget is projected to run a deficit in the current fiscal year 2026 and next year in 2027. But Little and state legislators have vowed to cut spending during this legislative session to avoid a budget deficit. The Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed revenue.

In 2025, the Legislature and Gov. Brad Little approved the creation of the accounts through House Bill 26. 
“The launch of the Idaho ABLE Savings Plan is a great opportunity for more Idahoans to save money, and I’m excited that they now have access to these accounts through Idaho’s own ABLE program,” Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth said in a statement.
Before Idaho allowed the accounts, Idaho was one of three states without them — and people with disabilities who had more than $2,000 in their bank accounts risked no longer qualifying for Social Security Income, Idaho Reports reported. 
Since the law directed Idaho to partner with a national group of ABLE accounts, the law is not projected to cost the state money, according to Idaho Reports. 
Idaho’s ABLE website has information on eligibility, contribution limits, investment options and enrollment. People are eligible for ABLE accounts if they have a disability that began before age 46, according to the Idaho State Independent Living Council.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Memphis-area senator is spearheading legislation that would require the Shelby County district attorney to notify multiple state and federal officials any time a felony case arising from a Memphis Safe Task Force arrest leads to a plea agreement, lowered charge, or dismissal.
Sen. Brent Taylor — a Republican representing Germantown, Lakeland, Collierville and part of East Memphis — called the bill the “Memphis Safe Task Force Accountability Act.” The act does not contain accountability provisions for the task force itself, but solely focuses on the district attorney’s handling of the hundreds of cases that result from the multi-agency law enforcement force launched in September by President Donald Trump.
The act would apply to district attorney generals of any judicial district in which the Memphis Safe Task Force or Operation Viper, an FBI mission in Memphis, are operating — ostensibly limiting the scope to Shelby County.
A district attorney general is elected by the public to represent the government in criminal cases, including reviewing evidence, filing charges and prosecuting people accused of crime. District Attorney General Steven Mulroy has served Shelby County in the role since 2022.

Mulroy said Taylor’s proposal is unnecessary and only creates additional burden for his office, which is already stretched thin due to hundreds of task force arrests with no support from the state or federal government to handle the larger case load.
“Logistically, it would be a nightmare,” Mulroy said.
Nationally, more than 90% of criminal cases end in a settlement, he said, and Shelby County is no different.
“We settle cases all the time, so to have to constantly keep track of that and notify multiple bodies every 24 hours would be incredibly burdensome,” he said. “And even if it wasn’t every 24 hours, keeping separate track of just those cases that come in from the federal task force would itself be burdensome. It is not the case that we treat the federal task force cases any differently from any other case, nor should we.”
Rep. John Gillespie, the bill’s House sponsor, deferred to Taylor for comment when reached via phone Thursday. Taylor did not respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. Marshals Service reported earlier this month that the task force has arrested 4,700 people since October 2025. While the Marshals have highlighted a fraction of the arrested individuals they deem “notable,” the Marshals and other agencies involved in the task force have yet to provide a full account of the names of individuals arrested or the specific charges they face.
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said in December that the task force does compile arrest information, but daily updates provided to his office are marked “sensitive information,” and he could not share it due to the risk of retaliation.
Tennessee, feds provide few details on cost, arrests three weeks into Memphis task force

The U.S. Marshals’ releases initially included the number of immigration-related arrests, but the service has since stopped providing that information. Initial data showed about 20% of the task force’s arrests were for alleged immigration violations, which are handled by immigration courts and are not under Mulroy’s purview.
Mulroy said a “large percentage” of the task force cases have involved lower-level misdemeanors and nonviolent crimes. A “minority” have been violent cases, with some of the more serious cases stemming from an existing backlog of outstanding warrants that the task force has assisted local law enforcement in clearing.
Mulroy said the task force cases have increased daily General Sessions dockets by as much as 50%, though he said he’s not “trying to pour shade on the federal task force.”
“Helping us with our backlog on outstanding warrants is a good thing, but you’re asking about the effect on our workload,” Mulroy said. “It has been significant, and this law would merely exacerbate that situation.”
Mulroy also said the law is duplicative, because the Tennessee legislature passed another law in 2024 — also sponsored by Taylor — that requires each district attorney general to provide an annual report to the governor, the speakers of the house and senate and others containing the number of arrests and indictments and final case dispositions and sentences, among other things.
That law goes into effect on July 1, 2026.
Taylor has repeatedly accused Mulroy of being soft on crime, calling Mulroy the “weak link in this unprecedented investment to clean up crime” in social media posts.
In an Oct. 31 editorial published in The Tennessean, Mulroy wrote that Taylor’s characterization is false and pointed to the more than 40,000 cases prosecuted by his office each year. Taylor has repeatedly filed ethics complaints against Mulroy, which were dismissed by the state’s ethics board, Mulroy wrote.

(Photo: Community Home Trust) North Carolina’s community land trusts are working to raise the profile of their housing preservation model, which its members see as a vital tool in the struggle for affordable housing in a rapidly growing state.
Community land trusts keep housing permanently affordable by maintaining ownership of the land and selling the homes or buildings sitting on it to individuals or groups. The model removes the land cost from the purchase price, and the land trust controls resale values to ensure homes remain affordable to future generations.
Several of the state’s trusts have launched the North Carolina Community Land Trust Coalition to share best practices and resources to shape housing policy, and “increase government and philanthropic support” for the programs by educating lawmakers and the public. 
Today, more than 300 Community Land Trusts operate across the country, including a dozen or more in North Carolina. Funding comes primarily through competitive processes for grants, loans and other sources at the federal, state and local levels.

“The hardest thing to do is to find operational funding, especially for newer land trusts that are starting to be created,” said Kimberly Sanchez, executive director of the Community Home Trust in Chapel Hill. “You have to acquire land, which is not cheap and you have to hold it forever, so you have to have some level of consistent operational funding just to make sure you can keep the inventory that you have forever for the community.”
Sanchez has led the Chapel Hill-based Community Home Trust for six years. The nonprofit has been around for more than 30 years and is one of the oldest community land trusts in the state. It followed the Durham Community Land Trustees, Inc., which became the first in the state in 1987.
Collectively, the state’s community land trusts have created 394 homeownership units, 398 affordable rental units and have supported households with an average of 63% of area median income, the coalition reported.
Sanchez’s group and the Durham Community Land Trustees control hundreds of those properties, while newer community land trusts control just a few or sometimes a single property. The coalition expects 12 to 14 members, but noted that some are new and still forming and will be added to the coalition’s new website at a later date. 
Sherry Taylor (Photo:Durham Community Land Trustees)
Sherry Taylor, executive director of the Durham Community Land Trustees, said the coalition’s rise is timely, given the growing interest in community land trusts in North Carolina.
“We actually started meeting last year to come together and make sure that permanently affordable housing is at the top of mind, not just for individual areas of the state that we cover, but as a statewide initiative,” Taylor said.
Taylor noted the state law allows property tax exemptions for certain affordable housing when they’re controlled by qualifying nonprofits.
But, she added, there’s more to be done.
“We realized that attainable housing, especially home ownership, is something that is a growing need all across the state,” Taylor said. “We wanted to first inform lawmakers that this is a model that has worked all over the country and has worked in North Carolina and is still working to create attainable homeownership.”
Finding new ways for community land trusts to increase production of affordable housing would be the next step in the process, Taylor said.
“I’m not gonna list out all the ways that they [lawmakers] can possibly help this group, but I do think thinking through those things and getting in front of them will be the primary goals of our coalition,” Taylor said. 
Last year, a study commissioned by NC REALTORS®, the NC Chamber and the NC Home Builders Association highlighted the extent of the housing crisis in the state. Researchers found North Carolina will need more than 764,000 rental and for-sale units over the next five years to meet demand across all 100 counties.
The NC Housing Coalition has found that 48% of state renters are cost burdened by rent payments and 19% of homeowners have trouble paying their mortgages. A family is considered cost-burdened if it spends more than 30% of income on housing.  
Diverse models
North Carolina’s community land trusts operate differently from each other even though they share the same model, said Sanchez with the Community Home Trust in Chapel Hill. She says the model’s flexibility allows responsiveness to local needs.
“We focus on different things, the way that we’re funded is different, the way we interact with our community is different,” Sanchez said. “Durham and Chapel Hill are 10 minutes away from each other, but even just culturally, they’re totally different.”
A notable difference, Sanchez said, is that Durham focused on rentals early on while her organization focused on homeownership. Now, Durham has a growing stock of owner-occupied homes and Sanchez’s organization has entered the rental market.
Sanchez’s organization has nearly 300 properties in its portfolio. Many were acquired through Chapel Hill’s inclusionary housing policy. Under the policy, housing developers are “encouraged” to sell a few housing units to the community land trust.  
“It’s that political will that has given us the opportunity to have almost 300 homes,” Sanchez said.
A startup in Watauga County
Over the summer, the relatively new Watauga Community Housing Trust celebrated the completion of its first home, a refurbished, one-bedroom house near downtown Boone that it sold to an adult with disabilities.
The volunteer-run and member-led nonprofit was created in response to skyrocketing housing costs in one of the state’s more expensive zip codes. Boone is a major tourist destination and home to Appalachian State University, both of which put pressure on housing costs.
Ben Loomis (Photo: Watauga Community Housing Trust)
Ben Loomis, a Watauga land trust member, said the previous owner of the house contacted the then-startup about selling a lot and a rundown house at a good price.  
“It was just sort of an opportunity that was too big to pass up, even though we at the time, we had really just gotten started,” Loomis said. “That was like early 2023 and we had no money in the bank.”
Loomis said the organization spent the next summer fundraising and raised enough money to purchase the property. Over the next two years, he said, the group took out a construction loan, continued to fundraise and “basically rebuilt it from the ground up, everything from the foundation to the roof.”
Affordable housing has become an even bigger issue in region in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Helene and the historic flooding that ensued, Loomis said. Thousands of homes were destroyed or damaged in Western North Carolina, including 140 housing units that were condemned in Boone due to flooding. 
“That exacerbated all of the issues that we were focused on when Helene hit,” Loomis said. 
The new coalition is an opportunity for established community land trusts and new ones like his to share expertise to advocate for a greater good, he said.
“We see the goal as to be able to provide resources to other new community land trusts as they start up, but also to work on a higher level and do lobbying and large-scale partnerships for material donations with building companies and universities that each individual and trust may not be able to do on its own,” Loomis said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Image-3-1024x768.png,,,2026-01-16 06:56:36.700142

Yusuf Hakeem, a Chattanooga Democrat, is raising questions about the transparency of a state partnership with Turning Point, USA. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Chattanooga lawmaker is questioning the state’s partnership with Turning Point USA, the ultra-conservative creation of the late Charlie Kirk, and the introduction of “Club America” into the state’s public high schools.
Democratic Rep. Yusuf Hakeem sent a letter Wednesday to Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds saying his concerns aren’t based on opposition to civic engagement or student participation, but the way the deal came about without transparency and the “broader implications” for public schools.
“It is troubling that this initiative was reportedly discussed and announced through private meetings, without prior public notice, stakeholder input or clear explanation of implementation standards,” Hakeem said in a letter to Reynolds. “Public schools are taxpayer-funded institutions, and decisions that impact students, families and educators should be made through transparent, inclusive and accountable processes.”
The Turning Point USA partnership was introduced by U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson in a closed announcement at the State Capitol with a video from Gov. Bill Lee, who a few weeks earlier said he didn’t know anything about it. It will enable students to set up their own clubs at school, purportedly to increase civil debate. Kirk’s calling card was to challenge students to prove him wrong when discussing issues.
Hakeem, though, said he’s concerned about how the partnership would align with the idea that public schools should remain “politically neutral environments,” since Turning Point USA is a partisan organization. In fact, President Donald Trump has called it a blueprint of sorts for his second term.
TPUSA Final Letter
Hakeem questioned whether groups with opposing political points of view would be given the same opportunity. Otherwise, the state risks undermining “trust” in its schools, he said in the letter. 
The lawmaker asked for clarification on the guidelines used to approve the partnership, as well as “safeguards” for ensuring neutrality and fairness, in addition to how transparency and accountability would be handled in the future.
“Tennessee’s public schools serve students of all backgrounds and beliefs. It is essential that educational policy decisions reflect fairness, openness and a commitment to democratic principles,” Hakeem said.
The lawmaker didn’t mention some of the demeaning things Kirk said publicly about Black men and women nor Kirk’s contention after six people were killed at The Covenant School in Nashville that school shootings were the price of having the Second Amendment. He was shot to death before an event at a Utah university where he was to debate students.
The state Department of Education declined to answer questions from the Lookout about Hakeem’s letter.
“The state of Tennessee stands ready to support those patriotic students’ efforts and ensure their constitutional rights are respected,” Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, said at the announcement of the state’s partnership with Turning Point, USA. (Photo: Sen.Jack Johnson Facebook)
Asked about the matter, Johnson said this week he believes the partnership was formed with complete transparency.
“I don’t know why somebody would think that it wasn’t,” Johnson said. “We’re excited to encourage as many Turning Point chapters (Club America) in Tennessee high schools as possible. It’s a great organization.”
Johnson said similar groups with opposing views would be able to form, too. He denied saying the attorney general’s office would provide a legal defense for the group against anyone who challenges the partnership. 
“I said that there would be consequences if someone tries to thwart the formation of (a club) as long as they’re following all the school policies like any other civic group in a high school,” Johnson.
The prediction here, though, is that Johnson and others won’t be holding announcements for a partnership with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.
Not only did Kirk posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of Honor, the House honored him with a resolution Thursday. Democrats objected to the move, but House Republicans used a maneuver to cut off debate and go straight to a vote that was overwhelmingly in favor.
Wouldn’t Kirk have demanded a civil debate?
One more for the road
House Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison announced Thursday he will leave the Tennessee legislature after nearly 16 years.
Faison, who earlier in the day passed the resolution honoring Kirk, won’t seek re-election to the District 11 seat representing Cocke County and parts of Hamblen and Jefferson counties in East Tennessee.
Faison said in an X statement that when he entered the House in 2010, a friend told him there are only three ways out of the legislature: losing an election, dying or walking out with your head held high, then said, “Jeremy, I don’t think you want to do the first two.”
The East Tennessean called it one of the “greatest honors” of his life and said only his faith and family are more important.
“I have nothing but respect, admiration and love for each one of you (constituents) and the greatest amount of respect and love for this institution,” he said.
A staunch conservative by most measures, Faison, nevertheless, supports the softening of Tennessee’s anti-cannabis laws.
He previously pushed passage of medical marijuana bills and said recently the federal government never had a “sound justification for a naturally occurring plant” to be classified as a Schedule I drug, which made it comparable to heroin, LSD and Ecstasy.

When Trump signed an order reclassifying marijuana, Faison said he hoped it encourages medical research “that either debunks what many sick Americans have testified to or provides the evidence and foundation showing that cannabis is safer than opioids and other man-altered substances.”
Faison would like to forget it, but he infamously tugged at the pants of a high school basketball referee who was calling his son’s ballgame in East Tennessee, drawing considerable ridicule in January 2022. He was ejected from the gym.
But he is leaving the legislature on his own accord.
Another defection
State Rep. Johnny Shaw of Bolivar said this week he will not run for re-election to another term, a move that could leave the House without one rural Democrat. 
At one time, rural Democrats from West Tennessee pretty much ruled the roost in the legislature. That control started slipping away in the early 2000s and culminated with the retirement of House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh of Covington.
His departure was followed by the one-term speakership of Republican Kent Williams who partnered with Democrats to ascend to the post instead of Jason Mumpower, who was expected to win the House election for the chamber’s top job. Instead, Mumpower got stuck with the comptroller’s job, which, truth be told, gives him about as much authority as the speaker.
Shaw, a preacher and 24-year House member who often quoted scriptures to back his stances, spoke vehemently against bills to make the Bible the state’s official book, saying its teachings should be kept in the heart and not in state politics.
Not in the hunt
Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn made a strong showing in the recent special election for the 7th Congressional District seat, pushing Republican Matt Van Epps to the limit. 
Behn cut the Republican margin of victory over the last two elections in half, whittling it down to less than 10 percentage points. Van Epps, though, picked up a Trump endorsement that pushed him to a win in the Republican primary and rode that to victory over Behn, capturing the seat mainly because of returns in Williamson County and the rural parts of the gerrymandered 7th District, which stretches from the Alabama line to Kentucky.
Rep. Aftyn Behn will use money left over from her recent congressional run to start a political organization. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“This campaign proved something important: with real investment and serious organizing, so-called ‘red states’ can compete,” Behn said. “Political power does not have to come at the expense of our marginalized communities, and there is a growing coalition of Tennesseans who are sick of the chaos and cost of living.”
But Behn said the race came with a heavy emotional and mental cost as she endured a “daily deluge of violent rape and death threats” in addition to digital stalking and harassment of her immediate family. She said she feared for her safety throughout the campaign and would need months to recuperate.
The East Nashville Democrat said she will run again for the District 51 House seat and use $200,000 in her federal campaign account to start a new organization called “Unrigged,” which will back her efforts to run for higher office in a few years.
In other words, this ain’t over.

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate) Lawmakers will decide Friday whether to send an additional $32 million to Arkansas’ school voucher program, which has seen a large increase in participation after opening to all students for the first time last fall. 
The Arkansas Legislative Council is taking up a request that would push the Educational Freedom Account program’s cost to nearly $310 million for the year.
The program, created through a 2023 education overhaul known as the LEARNS Act, provides state funding for allowable education expenses such as private school tuition. Lawmakers allocated more than $187 million for the program in the state’s budget in April before approving an additional $90 million in June.
State education officials have said the extra money is needed to support the expansion of the voucher program, which has grown to more than 44,000 since eligibility opened to all students for the 2025-2026 academic year.
Lawmakers earlier this week questioned how they would make room in the budget for the growing program in the future, as well as what guardrails are in place to ensure participants are using state funds appropriately. 
Despite those concerns, the subcommittee advanced the request to the full council following a voice vote with audible dissent. The Arkansas Legislative Council’s meeting begins at 9 a.m. Friday and it will be livestreamed here.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)SORRENTO — As a resident of heavily industrial Ascension Parish, Kheri Monks is no stranger to living near petrochemical facilities. Monks has been living in Gonzales for more than a decade. In that time, she had three children. All of them have asthma and were born prematurely. Monks thinks that exposure to pollutants might have led to their health concerns.
“I just can’t help but think, ‘Should I have not given birth here in Louisiana? You know, with all of the environmental concerns that we have?”’ Monks said. “I can’t believe I’m living, like literally living in Cancer Alley.”
Monks’ home is in the middle of “Cancer Alley,” the petrochemical corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that is home to more than 200 chemical-emitting industrial facilities, which many researchers and environmental groups have linked to disproportionately high rates of cancer, pre-term births and respiratory diseases.

Now Monks is worried about yet another petrochemical project in the works, one that would be built, in part, near her kids’ school.
For the past several years, Pennsylvania-based chemical company Air Products has been working toward building a new hydrogen plant in Sorrento. The plant will process natural gas, separating hydrogen from carbon dioxide. But instead of having excess carbon dioxide enter the atmosphere, the company would capture the byproduct greenhouse gas and pipe it through Ascension, St. James, St. John the Baptist, Tangipahoa and Livingston Parishes, before storing it underground beneath Lake Maurepas. Because of its relatively low-carbon footprint, the project is being promoted as a “green” energy solution.
Air Products declined an interview for this story. During a public meeting in November, Air Product’s vice president, Andrew Connelly, said the project will, “dramatically reduce the world’s potential impact on the environment and the surrounding community.”
The project would be the largest carbon sequestration and storage project in the world, according to Air Products, and will prevent most of the plant’s carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. But critics have said the pipeline project puts vital wetland, including Lake Mareupas, at risk.
Monks, though, worries about how the pipeline will affect her family. The hydrogen plant is being built near Sorrento Primary School, where her children are currently enrolled. The school, and the Orange Grove subdivision that it’s located in, would be just half a mile away from the proposed carbon dioxide pipeline if the project continues. And having a carbon dioxide pipeline can be risky — a report from Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that there are at least three carbon dioxide pipeline leaks every year.

Although the chemical compound is naturally present in the air, high concentrations of it can cause dizziness, headache, and in extreme cases, suffocation. In 2020, a leak in Satartia, Mississippi led to 45 hospitalizations and forced 200 residents to evacuate. Stricter regulations had been proposed to prevent future leaks near the end of Joe Biden’s presidential term, but those proposals were tabled when President Donald Trump entered office.
To continue, the project needs a coastal use permit from the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy and a Clean Water Act permit from the Army Corps of Engineers. Air Products submitted the applications early last year. Representatives from both departments said they will consider the project’s impacts on the community when granting the permits, but are more concerned about impacts to coastal waters and wetlands.
Federal and state regulations require pipelines to avoid populated places like business, schools, and neighborhoods, said Patrick Courreges, spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy. But pipelines can still be within 50 feet of those populated places if they have additional cover to protect against surface ruptures. In fact, there are already two active hydrogen pipelines surrounding the school, one of which is owned by Air Products.
The potential adverse health effects and little documentation of Air Products’ plans in case of an emergency, prompted environmental law nonprofit Earthjustive to partner with a scientist who modeled the CO2 pipeline rupture in Satartia and commission a model of what a rupture could look like near Sorrento Primary School.
“What this report shows is that the pipeline would put these kids and teachers in harm’s way,” said Earthjustice scientist Cyndhia Ramatchandirane. “There would be a very large cloud of CO2 that would cover the area, the houses, the school very quickly — within like 10 minutes.”
Because carbon dioxide is so dense, concentrations of it would be higher near the ground, where children are, Ramatchandirane said. The model predicts that the levels of carbon dioxide released could trigger respiratory distress and elevated heart rates in healthy adults, based on thresholds set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But it’s unclear how the effects of CO2 exposure would be different for children who already have respiratory illnesses, such as Monks’ kids.
Even if a leak is discovered and the pipeline is shut off relatively quickly, the model still predicts “serious health effects” for those in the school and in the neighborhood, Ramatchandirane said. And emergency response could also be slowed down in the event of a leak, as high levels of carbon dioxide in the air prevent combustion engines, which need oxygen to work, from starting.
Emergency response is just one thing that parent Estefania Aultman, who has been working to inform her community about the plant to prevent its construction, worries about when it comes to the project. Aultman’s son attends Sorrento Primary School, and she said the town doesn’t have the infrastructure to deal with a full response to a leak.

In an email to WWNO and Verite News, Air Products said it has engaged with local first responders through the Ascension Parish Community Awareness and Emergency Response group, a collection of chemical and industrial companies that have plants in Ascension Parish working with local government to prepare for industrial emergencies.
James LeBlanc, the group’s chairman and Ascension Parish’s fire chief, did not make himself available for an interview for this story.
As part of an effort to improve community relations, Air Products has also made a $280,000 donation to the River Parishes Community College to start a year-long afterschool STEM program at Sorrento Primary and Lowery Elementary schools. The program, which started this fall and currently serves third graders, is meant to boost career readiness so that students can one day join the energy industry.
Aultman said that students at Sorrento Primary don’t often have opportunities to pursue specialized afterschool programming. She has criticized the program and sees it as a way to keep parents from speaking out against the plant.
“Do you think parents really want to talk about how they’re against Air Products if they just funded [this program]?” Aultman said.

Aultman and Monks said there has been little communication from Air Products and the parish about the project and its potential risks. Aultman said she’s reached out to members of the school board and Sorrento Primary’s principal, Honey Lundin, to ask if they’ve received information about the project from Air Products, but hasn’t received a response.
In a statement to Verite News, Ascension Parish Schools spokesperson Jackie Tisdell said the district is committed to providing safe learning environments and collaborating with community partners.
“Ascension Public Schools is focused on educating students and supporting their success,” Tisdell said. “We value our relationships with community and business partners who share in that commitment.”
Aultman, a former insulator at Exxon who used to patch leaks by tanks and pipes, said that a leak near the school would be “catastrophic.” It’s not a risk she’s willing to take. Aultman said her family will move if the project continues.
“We started looking for homes,” Aultman said. “We’re willing to fight this, but if we can’t get our voices heard and get enough community involved and engaged, like if it is just me speaking or a handful of people, it’s just not gonna be enough. And I can’t, I can’t have my family here for that.”

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Despite Gov. Patrick Morissey’s focus on improving West Virginia’s troubled foster care system, data from the state’s judicial branch shows the number of foster children living in hotels hasn’t improved over the last year.
“Unfortunately, we haven’t seen a real decrease in the number of hotel youth,” said Cindy Largent-Hill, director of the Division of Children’s Services in the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. She presented the information to members of the House Committee on Judiciary Thursday at the state Capitol. 
“We tend to hover on average between 15 to 25 children a day in a hotel,” she said.
West Virginia Watch reported this week that the state Department of Human Services is also using short-term rental properties, like Airbnb, to house foster children. A child in foster care was recently injured while living in one of the rental properties and received medical care. 
Largent-Hill has served as a court-ordered monitor for the past year of the state’s use of hotels and short-term rental properties to house foster children after a 12-year-old boy involved in a case attempted suicide in a hotel last year.
The state’s use of hotels and short-term rental properties for children is due the state’s lack of psychiatric treatment beds and appropriate care options. 
According to Largent-Hill, some children coming into the system need an intensive hospital setting for ongoing medication monitoring and counseling; many of the children are struggling with self harm and suicidal ideation, she said. 
“I have never in my life seen children as challenging and as the mental health issues we’re seeing, [and] the autism, the low, low low cognitive functioning,” Largent-Hil said. “We’re seeing more children, younger children, more involved children. It’s really heart-wrenching what is coming into the system … Using hotels is a symptom of an issue within the entire child welfare system.”
In February of 2020, there were 810 in-state treatment beds available to children in the state; now, that number has dropped to about 149.
“Unfortunately, over recent years, the number of beds in West Virginia has decreased,” Largent-Hill. “After Aug. 1 of 2025, unfortunately, West Virginia lost our psychiatric residential treatment facility beds.”
The lack of in-state pediatric beds has also led the state to send hundreds of foster children to out-of-state facilities. There are 380 children in out-of-state institutions in states including California, Florida, Texas and Utah, according to DoHS data.
Morrisey announced a $6 million initiative to bring out-of-state children back to West Virginia, and he’ll need to renovate state facilities and recruit staff for these high-needs children. 
Alex J. Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services
DoHS Secretary Alex Mayer shared positive changes in child welfare over the last year but told lawmakers, “In terms of hard metrics, we’re still seeing kids go out of state. We’re still seeing kids in the utilization of hotels.”
The department is having conversations with in- and out-of-state providers to increase specialized care for kids. They’ve also initiated contracts with providers to help get kids out of hotels, Mayer said. 
“So that’s also taken time, and I think we’ll start seeing a change in that trend as we’re starting to sign those contracts and get those things in place, get the training and licensing established,” Mayer said.. “I’m confident that we’ll continue to see some progressive change within the system in some of the problem areas that we’ve traditionally seen those numbers not move.”
West Virginia short on attorneys for child welfare cases 
Largent-Hill highlighted other issues in the child welfare system from the court’s perspective, including that the state saw a decrease over the last year in the number of attorneys certified to take on child welfare cases.
“We continue to have a concern and a desert of attorneys to do child abuse and neglect work,” she told lawmakers. “We have a couple of circuits that only have one.”
Last year, Morrisey vetoed a bill that would have given public defenders and guardian ad litems working with child welfare cases a pay raise of an additional $10 per hour for in- and out-of-court work. In his veto message, Morrisey said he was “sympathetic to the intent of this bill” but noted that lawmakers had reduced his proposed funding amount for the Public Defender Services.
The Republican-sponsored legislation was in an effort to improve the shortage of guardian ad litems, which are required in child welfare cases and represent the best interests of the child. The shortfall has led to cases often lingering in the court system while children await permanency. 
Del. J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha\
Del. J.B. Akers, chair of the House Committee on Judiciary, said foster care reform will once again be a focus for his committee, which met for the first time Thursday.
 There are around 6,000 children in West Virginia foster care.
“ … Until that issue is significantly resolved, that will continue as long as I’m the chairman, to be the primary focus of this committee,” said Akers, R-Kanawha. “We have a lot of issues we have to deal with, but the child welfare issues in this state will be the priority issue that we look at.”

(Courtesy of Denver Public Library Special Collections, X-11769)On the morning of Jan. 15, 1876, the town of Boulder’s leading citizens gathered at the train depot to welcome a special passenger car carrying Colorado Gov. John Routt and about 50 other dignitaries from the territorial capital, who had been invited to inspect the future site of the soon-to-be state’s flagship university.
 

This story is part of Colorado at 150, featuring special reports on the people and history that define the state.


The trustees of the University of Colorado were eager to show off to their visitors the 55-acre site donated by the town to the new college, where a state-of-the-art $30,000 building — complete with gas light fixtures, soundproofed floors and a ventilation system — was nearly finished.
“The chapel is a fine room, and, indeed, so are all the rooms on the first and second floors,” reported the Rocky Mountain News on Jan. 16. “The building committee are well satisfied with the manner in which the work has been carried on.”
Known today as Old Main, the building recently underwent its third major renovation, and ranks among the oldest continuously occupied public buildings in Colorado.
The territorial Legislature had authorized the establishment of a public university as early as 1861, but momentum had stalled for more than a decade amid Colorado’s broader stagnation during the Civil War and its aftermath. In 1874, lawmakers finally agreed to appropriate $15,000 for the university’s construction in Boulder, on the condition that the townsfolk there raise the remainder of the necessary funds.

The cause of public education, or the “common school” system, was championed by several of the Colorado Territory’s most prominent citizens — especially among liberal Republicans, who viewed public schools as a crucial tool in remaking the United States an egalitarian republic in the Reconstruction era.
Routt and his fellow visitors, who included many members of the Legislature and the constitutional convention, which had convened in Denver, were welcomed in Boulder by a committee that included John A. Ellet, a former Union Army colonel and early CU booster. Public schooling, he told the assembled dignitaries, was “the palladium of our liberty.”
“It says to the rich man, you must contribute of your abundance to educate the child of your poor neighbor, so that a knowledge of the elementary branches shall be within reach of all,” Ellet said, according to The Boulder County News, calling on the Legislature to make a “liberal appropriation” for the new university, and to levy a new tax to safeguard its future.
“​​‘Oh!’ says one, ‘but there’s the taxes. You must not increase the taxes!’ The citizens of Boulder do not feel so,” Ellet continued. “We know that if we would enjoy the blessings which modern civilization confers, we must pay for them, and we are willing to do it.”
Boulder and the university trustees wanted the 11th and final territorial Legislature to appropriate the $30,000 needed to “put the university in operation during the Centennial year,” the Rocky Mountain News reported.
Lawmakers balked at that request, appropriating just $15,000 instead. Later in the year, Routt reported that Old Main, though structurally complete, still lacked furniture, and CU Boulder wouldn’t admit its first class of students until 1877.

A war of words
Boulder in 1876 was the setting for an old-fashioned frontier newspaper war. Proprietors Otto Wangelin and Robert Tilney had launched The Colorado Banner the previous year as a Democratic rival to The Boulder County News, an established Republican journal published by Amos Bixby and Eugene Wilder.
The simmering tensions between the two weeklies — the Banner published on Thursdays, the News on Fridays — boiled over in an editorial published by the Banner on Jan. 20, 1876. Provoked by a minor dispute over whether the Banner had inadvertently made an “inexcusable thrust” at the conduct of one of Boulder County’s delegates to the constitutional convention, the Banner’s Democratic editors unleashed a torrent of invective against their Republican rivals.
“​​There are some men in this world who are happiest when they can lie,” bemoaned the Banner’s editorial.
“The efforts of the News ever since the Banner was started have been to run it down in the eyes of the people,” it complained. “The first note made of its rival was the prophecy by a dead beat that this paper would fail, the next was a charge that the Banner was opposed to public schools, a charge as false as it was malicious, then came a charge on an editorial of a possible suspension, and now is the News guilty of the above misrepresentations, gross and unjust, and which the News knows is as false as Satan.”
“What could be the object of the News in thus misrepresenting? Did it want to get on the soft side of our representative in the constitutional convention, and influence him against this paper?” the Banner continued. “The only other solution is that the News wanted to get off something smart, and that the underhanded nature again showed itself, and all because the Banner is gaining daily in circulation and patronage.”
After a series of changes in name and ownership, the two rival papers went on to merge in the mid-1880s, but the Boulder News and Banner would ultimately lose out to the Boulder Daily Camera, which published its first issue in 1890.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Another legislative session has started in West Virginia, and call me naive, but I’m feeling a little optimistic when it comes to environmental issues. Over the last year, West Virginians have paid attention to things like proposed dirty data centers in their communities, rising utility bills and the lack of clean water for many residents.
It’s not fair that we have to deal with these challenges. West Virginia shouldn’t be a testing ground for out of state actors to put their data centers and reap the profits while leaving us with the burden of dirtier air and water. We shouldn’t allow our power bills to spike because some lawmakers and the Public Service Commission dedicate themselves to propping up coal plants and discouraging renewable energy, even though it is typically cheaper and faster to build. 
It’s worse that our state and federal representatives have hardly lifted a finger to solve these problems. In fact, they’ve often doubled down. 
But this year could be the start of a different path. This week, state environmental organizations, including the West Virginia Environmental Council (disclaimer, I’m the board president) released a policy book outlining experts’ and citizens’ legislative priorities. We didn’t just write this book for legislators under the golden dome, agency leaders or the decisionmakers at the Governor’s mansion, but for readers like you, too. 
Sometimes the issues we discuss can sound too nebulous or too boring for even the strongest environmental advocates. With this book, we broke down complex issues like forever chemicals and data center development. Readers can get insight on what the current local landscape is for each topic. We also recommend actions that the legislature can take to start making headway towards solutions. Some of these actions include reforming the data center legislation that passed last year, funding the Flood Resiliency Trust Fund for the first time and addressing our state’s mine and gas well crises. 
We designed every section to provide a succinct overview of the issue. Readers interested in learning more, can always reach out to WVEC and the authors and organizations listed in each section. This is just the inaugural edition. It’s our hope that the book will grow in the years to come. There are more environmental challenges that we face than we could include in the book. Please tell us what you think we missed or should include next year. 
Use this to start conversations. It’s our hope that this policy book can help West Virginians become stronger advocates for the environmental issues that are affecting their communities. Now it’s time for our legislators to listen to the expert guidance in this booklet and rally for the health and wellbeing of their constituents.

(Examiner file photo)According to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau (LFB) analysis released on Thursday, Wisconsin’s general fund balance at the end of the biennium, June 30, 2027, is projected to be $2.37 billion. The projection is about $1.53 billion above the projected balance when the 2025-27 biennial budget was enacted last year.
According to the LFB, the majority of the growth, $1.367 billion, is due to an increase in estimated tax collections. Other contributions to the growth include $104 million in departmental revenues, an increase of $49.9 million in sum sufficient appropriations and an increase of $107.8 million in the amounts that are estimated to lapse to the general fund.
Both Republicans and Democrats sought to take credit for the news.
Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) and Sen. Howard Marklein (R- Spring Green) said in a statement that Republicans’ “long-standing commitment to responsible budgeting and fiscal discipline is working.” 
The lawmakers warned that the state should continue to exercise caution. 
“These increased revenue estimates are driven in part by strong stock market performance and resulting tax collections,” the lawmakers said. “We must be careful when committing to ongoing spending using one-time money. Our disciplined approach has delivered results and put Wisconsin in a strong fiscal position.”
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said that the numbers are “a tribute to Wisconsin Democrats, who have prioritized investments in the people of Wisconsin that have improved our state’s economy, provided middle class tax relief and helped make Wisconsin a state where businesses want to invest and families want to live.”
Gov. Tony Evers told reporters that the revenues were larger than expected on Monday and he wanted to use the funds for priorities including over $1 billion in property tax relief. Republican lawmakers have said that they want Evers’ 400-year veto, which gave school districts the ability to enact annual revenue limit increases, repealed in order to deal with rising tax cuts.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)Our president is using his attorney general to make war on our chief central banker. He’s threatening real war that would destroy the Atlantic alliance. His immigration police are dangerously out of control. His broken health department says nothing about flu shots in the middle of a flu outbreak.
Worse than the flu, Donald Trump has the nation and much of the world in a political and social fever. When will it break? When the Epstein files are finally revealed, as required by a federal law co-sponsored by Rep. Thomas Massie, whom Trump is trying to oust in Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District? We sure haven’t heard much about the files since Trump imposed suzerainty on Venezuela.
There’s no telling when the files will see full light, but Trump’s political standing is already shrinking, from growing Republican objections and from the action of state election laws. It shrank just a little more on Friday, Jan. 9, the filing deadline for this year’s primary elections in Kentucky. As more such deadlines pass (in half the states by March 15, and in 32 by the end of March), more Republicans in Congress will no longer fear a Trump-endorsed primary opponent and will be more willing to buck him.
There were several signs of that as Congress reconvened. Massie and Rep. James Comer were among 35 House Republicans who voted to override Trump’s spiteful veto of a Colorado water project. Comer represents the 1st District, would like to be elected governor next year, and may figure that he needs a few fig leaves of independence from a president who may be largely discredited by the time November 2027 rolls around.
By that time, Gov. Andy Beshear will probably have been a declared presidential candidate for some time, and he keeps moving closer to it, most recently and publicly in his Jan. 7 State of the Commonwealth and budget address, which was chock-full of hints.
Beshear said “American” or “America” 30 times, beginning with “To every Kentuckian and every American watching from home, good evening.” (The address was on C-SPAN and covered live by Jonathan Martin, senior political columnist and politics bureau chief for Politico, ahead of an interview with Beshear the next day.) Most of those references were to “the American Dream,” which the governor said is being threatened by “the president’s big, ugly bill.”

The address was given in the state history center, because the Capitol is under renovation – “a reminder that our great democracy at times can buckle, and that cracks in the foundation and stress on the joints can threaten our very future,” Beshear said.
Most of the speech was a Beshear brag-and-propose litany, but there were enough national references to hold the attention of Democrats in other states. And Beshear continued his steady improvement in presentation, much as one of his national rivals, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, did the next night in Sacramento.
Beshear cited Kentucky as an object example to a country “looking to find hope beyond the chaos” and “a national politics poisoned with division,” a state where “we’ve found a way to work together, to find unity, and to succeed.” But Republican legislators have long been the state’s main policymakers, due to their big majorities, and most didn’t attend the speech. Senate President Robert Stivers said Beshear’s presidential chances were worse than a snowball’s in hell.
Stivers and House Speaker David Osborne have little use for Beshear, and continue to reject his call for universal pre-kindergarten. Beshear surely knows his big policy proposal is doomed; he said “If you’re against this because you think it gives me a win, what you’re really doing is handing these kids a loss.”
Perhaps Democrats in this year’s legislative elections can make an issue of pre-K, but it would make little difference in the balance of power because they don’t even have candidates running for most Republican seats, as Louisville Public Media first reported.
Beshear described Kentucky’s political situation best when he compared it with the nation’s: “In Kentucky, we’ve turned down the temperature.” That’s mainly due to traditional Republican leaders like Stivers and Osborne, who have done a good job of thwarting most of their feverish members’ wishes. For example, Osborne said on KET Monday night that Somerset Rep. Shane Baker’s bill to bar naturalized citizens from public office has constitutional problems.
On the same show, Stivers revealed that he had rebuffed a White House request that the legislature split Jefferson County among more congressional districts in order to oust 3rd District Rep. Morgan McGarvey, the only Democrat in the state’s delegation. He also said legislators hadn’t discussed further limiting the governor’s powers — which Comer was surely glad to hear.
So, as we pray for the national fever to break, let’s be thankful that Kentucky isn’t so badly afflicted.

Glenn Youngkin reflected on his four-year term. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)As he prepares to hand the keys of the Executive Mansion to his Democratic successor, Gov. Glenn Youngkin says his four years leading Virginia exceeded even his own expectations — a tenure he describes as transformative, results-driven and largely free of regret.
In an expansive interview with the Virginia Mercury on Thursday in the governor’s Cabinet Conference Room at the Patrick Henry Building in Richmond — less than 48 hours before Abigail Spanberger is sworn in as Virginia’s 75th governor — Youngkin framed his administration as one that fundamentally changed how state government operates, despite four years of divided government.
“I really don’t like the question about people’s legacy. What I think most about is, what is the impact that we’ve had on Virginia going forward,” Youngkin said. “And it really is a comprehensive transformation of the state, and where it’s going.”
Youngkin, a former private-equity executive who entered public office as a political outsider, said he rejected the idea that governors must limit their ambitions to a narrow set of achievable goals. 
Instead, he said, his administration pursued broad changes across nearly every area of state government — from education and public safety to economic development, behavioral health and core state services.
“We came in with a mindset of transforming the way government works, and defining success as delivering results as opposed to activity,” Youngkin said. “That transformation is not defined by a bill or a single program. It is a comprehensive effort that changes the way things are done and delivers results.”
The remarks echoed themes from Youngkin’s final State of the Commonwealth address Wednesday, in which he highlighted record economic investment, regulatory rollbacks, education reforms and public safety initiatives.
 A businessman governor grappling with divided government

Youngkin, 59, was elected in 2021 by narrowly defeating former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, winning a then-purple state at a moment of pandemic-era frustration over school closures and remote learning. 
He governed for four years, with Democrats controlling both chambers of the General Assembly for part of his tenure — a dynamic that shaped both his accomplishments and his conflicts.
“I am encouraged by the fact that we have this comprehensive transformation … while we have a divided government,” Youngkin said. “Because we never had the General Assembly aligned with us. And we still were able to accomplish all of this.”
Youngkin said divided government forced negotiation but did not derail his administration’s fiscal agenda, pointing to budgets approved with bipartisan support and the ability to fund major initiatives.
“We generated $10 billion in surplus revenue, $9 billion in tax relief, in a divided government,” he said. “We delivered the funding to support the transformation in education, and behavioral health, and made sure that we could change the way we do business development.”
At the same time, Youngkin used his veto power aggressively during his tenure — a fact Democrats say underscores how often the governor clashed with the legislature.
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said Youngkin struggled to define a clear governing vision and often prioritized cultural fights over affordability.
“He vetoed a record number of bills,” Scott said in an interview Thursday. “So what did voters do? They hired me to be speaker in the middle of his term, they fired his Republican speaker, and they gave us the majority.”
Scott said Democrats frequently pushed back against what he described as Youngkin’s emphasis on cultural issues rather than kitchen-table concerns.
“The governor wanted less teacher pay; we got more teacher pay. He wanted less for health care; we got more for health care,” Scott said. “He spent most of his time fighting culture wars.”
Scott said Youngkin’s rise was tied to a specific set of circumstances rather than a durable realignment of Virginia politics.
“I think his legacy will be, for Virginia, that he was a flash-in-the-pan governor,” Scott said.
Despite those disagreements, Scott said his personal working relationship with Youngkin improved after Democrats re-took control of the House in 2023, and he credited the governor with making a consistent effort to engage once Scott became speaker.
Scott said Youngkin regularly attended his weekly interfaith prayer breakfasts — early-morning gatherings held every Wednesday at 7 a.m. during the legislative session.
“He didn’t miss one, ever, when I was speaker,” Scott said. “So I give him a lot of credit for that.”
Scott also said he respected Youngkin for entering public life from a position of professional and financial success.
“He could have stayed rich and continued to do his thing,” Scott said. “But the fact that he put his name in the hat and entered the arena, I admire that as well.”
 Economic development and deregulation

In the interview, Youngkin framed his record primarily around jobs, investment and what he described as a fundamental reshaping of how Virginia competes for business.
He pointed to what his administration says is $157 billion in committed capital investment, record job growth and a sweeping effort to reduce state regulations.
“When I wrote that executive order on day one to get 25% of our regulations either removed or streamlined, there was the big question, ‘Sir, how do we do this?’” Youngkin said. “And before you know it, we not only got through 25%, we got through 35% of regulations, streamlined saving Virginians $1.4 billion a year.”
Although it’s still not clear exactly how his administration calculated those reductions, Youngkin emphasized that they were accomplished entirely within the executive branch. “There was no bill,” Youngkin said. “It was a managerial exercise.”
Youngkin also pointed to decisions by major companies to locate or expand advanced manufacturing and pharmaceutical operations in Virginia, including facilities announced by AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Merck.
These businesses, he said, “made a decision to come and build their futures, their largest facilities in the world, right here in Virginia. That ecosystem is now so strong that we’ll continue to see great companies come.”
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said those corporate commitments — along with Youngkin’s sustained attention to Southwest Virginia — shape how the governor is viewed in much of rural Virginia.
“I think his legacy for Virginia is he’s been our job creator,” Kilgore told The Mercury in an interview Thursday. “On a personal note, he really helped Southwest Virginia during the disasters. He showed up.”
Kilgore said Youngkin’s visibility during the devastating flooding spurred by Hurricane Helene in 2024 and the ensuing human suffering left a lasting impression.
“Seeing him in action when people lost everything, and here Governor Youngkin was praying with them and talking to them — that was really impressive,” Kilgore said.
 Education, behavioral health and public safety

Youngkin said education reform was another defining feature of his administration, citing new accreditation standards, revised academic benchmarks, cellphone restrictions in classrooms and expanded tutoring initiatives.
“We established expectations of excellence,” he said. “We overhauled the entire accreditation system.”
But some of Youngkin’s education changes drew sharp criticism, particularly his administration’s initial overhaul of the state’s K-12 history and social science standards. 
Early drafts were widely criticized by educators, historians and civil rights groups for omitting context on race and slavery and for what opponents described as political bias, prompting delays and significant revisions after a contentious public review process. 
Youngkin also pointed to investments in behavioral health, calling the system “broken” when he took office and crediting his administration with fundamentally changing how services are delivered.
Veteran Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth said those efforts may be among Youngkin’s most durable accomplishments.
“I think he can take some credit for making further progress on addressing the behavioral health issues in Virginia,” Holsworth said. “And he was very popular in Southwest Virginia for the fact that he showed up a lot.”
Still, Holsworth argued that Youngkin’s governing style relied heavily on executive authority rather than legislation.
“When you look at his legacy, he has no legislative legacy. What you saw on Wednesday was a list of executive actions,” Holsworth said, referring to Youngkin’s final speech before the joint legislature this week, where he touted his accomplishments.
 Controversies and regrets

Asked whether he regretted any decisions, Youngkin said he did not — though he expressed frustration over the collapse of a proposed Northern Virginia sports and entertainment complex, which Senate Democrats blocked amid opposition led by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth.
“That was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It would have benefited Virginia hugely,” Youngkin said. “And it was blocked wrongly.”
The proposal would have brought an estimated $12 billion in economic development and 30,000 jobs, according to the administration. Opponents said it wasn’t a project citizens should be responsible for financing, and pointed to possible transportation and environmental challenges with the arena plan. 
Youngkin also defended his approach to higher education governance, where his board appointments at UVA and other institutions sparked partisan battles.
“I’m so proud of the board work that our team has done,” he said, criticizing Senate Democrats for blocking nominees he described as highly qualified.
 Trump, national politics and political fallout

Youngkin rejected the premise that he distanced himself from Donald Trump during his 2021 campaign, saying Trump’s 2016 victory influenced his decision to run while his own race remained focused on state issues.
“One of the primary influences on my decision to do that was the fact that a businessman named Donald Trump had stepped out of his life, run for president, and won,” Youngkin said, echoing sentiments he shared in a speech at the Republican National Convention in 2024 where Trump became his party’s nominee for president. 
“In my race, the key was focusing on state issues, local issues, and not a federal race, because at the end of the day, governor is a state job.”
Youngkin said his relationship with the Trump administration during the president’s second term benefited Virginia through preserved grant funding and federal cooperation.
Holsworth said that embrace ultimately proved costly for Republicans in Virginia, who lost all three statewide races in November.
“That turned out to be a debacle of historic proportions for his own party,” he said. “He essentially made the Democrats’ argument.”
Scott echoed that view, saying Youngkin’s political pivot was noticeable.
“It took him almost four years to begin mentioning Trump’s name,” Scott said.
 Leaving office

As he prepares to leave public office, Youngkin said he was surprised by how much his administration was able to accomplish — and by how much he enjoyed serving alongside his wife, Suzanne, whose work on fentanyl prevention he repeatedly praised.
“I didn’t expect we could get this much done,” Youngkin said. “I had ambitions and dreams of what we might be able to do, but I was told by everybody, there’s no way you could do it.”
With his term ending and a transition underway, Youngkin said he is ready to step away from public office, at least for now.
“We’re taking a break,” Youngkin said. “Suzanne and I are going on vacation to an undisclosed location.”

(Stock.adobe.com image by s_l).State officials this week voted to tap private health insurance plans to make up for an expected loss in funding and rate-setting control as Maryland transitions to a new federal framework for Medicare payments to state hospitals.
The changes approved Wednesday by the Health Services Cost Review Commission will not take effect for at least a year, but will likely mean higher premiums for people on private health insurance plans when they do kick in.
It’s part of a multiyear shift to the new Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design, or AHEAD, model of setting hospital rates for Medicare services in the state.
Private insurers are less than pleased with the new plan.
“We remain concerned that the state relies again and again on the commercial market when unaffordable health care costs already burden Maryland families and businesses,” said Matthew Celentano of the League of Life and Health Insurers in Maryland, in response to Wednesday’s policy approvals.
The state’s previous hospital rate setting system technically came to an end on Dec. 31 — even if major changes in state operation have not yet occurred. The old model, called the Total Cost of Care system, gave Maryland officials authority to regulate hospital costs across all payers in the system, which include private insurance, Medicaid and Medicare.
Total Cost of Care leveled costs for patients across coverage types, so that different patients did not end up paying more for the same services. Those rates are set by the Health Services Cost Review Commission.
Work AHEAD: State, federal officials finalizing terms of new hospital system in Maryland

Maryland has had the authority to set Medicare hospital rates for more than 40 years, but it will lose that authority under the AHEAD model by 2028, when rate-setting will revertto the federal government. AHEAD also requires the state to reduce Medicare spending by $435 million annually.
The changes approved Wednesday would increase hospital rates for the commercial market by $87 million annually, beginning in 2028. State officials estimate that those rate increase will add a total of 1.8% to private consumers’ premiums by 2032.
That’s not a huge hike in premiums, but it comes on top of growing health care costs generally. Last year, state insurance officials approved an average 13.4% rate increase for 2026 health care plans to account for the expiration of a federal tax credit that helped thousands of Marylanders afford health care in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
Subsidizing Medicare Advantage
Wednesday’s changes also turn to private insurance plans to fund efforts to preserve Medicare Advantage — supplemental, private insurance that provides coverage such as vision, dental and transportation assistance that may not be covered by standard Medicare plans.
About a quarter of Maryland Medicare recipients also use Medicare Advantage, but thousands have lost that coverage recently as insurers pull out of the state, where they say the current hospital system makes it too costly for them to do business.
In an effort to keep insurers in the state, the changes approved this week would let Medicare Advantage plans reimburse hospitals at a rate about 11.55% less than what they pay, starting in 2027.
To offset the financial loss to hospitals, the HSCRC plans to raise rates for private insurers. State documents say commercial rates are expected to increase by 0.75% “once fully implemented” from the Medicare Advantage stabilization policy.
“Total increases to commercial rates across both proposals will amount to 2.55 percent by 2032, with the largest single-year increases occurring in 2028, at 0.6 percent combined for the two programs,” according to the Department of Health.
Jon Kromm, executive director for the cost review commission, said that both policy recommendations approved Wednesday have the possibility for “refinements” and other changes in future discussions.
Maryland has used state funding in the past to prop up the Medicare Advantage market, but with state lawmakers facing a $1.5 billion budget deficit this year, officials were wary of relying on state dollars again.
Thousands of Maryland seniors notified of the end of their Medicare Advantage plans

 
“It seemed like a reasonable plan to fix it,” Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, said Thursday of the approved Medicare Advantage policy.
“The only question I really have is that we kind of have the problem now. So, you’re kind of waiting until ’27. What happens between now and ’27?” Ransom asked.
It’s one of many questions facingthe Maryland health care system as it continues its bumpy transition to AHEAD.
State and federal officials had signed an agreement in 2024 that would have largely kept the state’s authority to regulate all payers intact. But the Trump administration decided early last year to renegotiate the terms of that agreement, the start of the move toward the AHEAD model.
State and federal officials went back and forth over how much authority Maryland should have to dictate hospital rates. Ultimately, the state was allowed to keep much of its hospital payment system for two years, allowing time to implement larger policy changes before revoking the state’s authority to set Medicare rates in 2028.
Maryland Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said that AHEAD will help the state move toward a “world-class health care system,” but there is still “a lot of good work ahead of us.”
“Landing the model with CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) was absolutely a team effort,” she said via Zoom during Wednesday’s HSCRC meeting. “I think we know when this all started, it created a lot of uncertainty for the market, for the communities in our state.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) instructed Seshamani in September to create a multi-agency workgroup — including the health department, the HSCRC, state insurance officials and other health-related officials — to work on implementing some of the larger changes under the AHEAD agreement.
Cost-sharing and stabilizing the Medicare Advantage market are the first two priorities the workgroup has addressed so far, with more to come.
“We have landed in a place that will be incorporating feedback from everyone and all the perspectives to have something that works for the entire state, from the hospitals to the payers to individuals to Maryland businesses, the physicians,” Seshamani said.

Eleven groups petitioned the agency in 2022 to protect the yellow and purple critters that are found in shale and sandstone rockfaces in West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Those habitats have frequently been subject to blasting for mountaintop removal mining. 
The lawsuit alleges that the agency has missed the mandated timeline of 12 months to conduct assessments on species that could qualify for the endangered or threatened lists. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service found in 2024 there is a possibility the salamander may qualify for special protections under the Endangered Species Act. It stated in the January 2024 release that a review would begin. But it has been two years and a decision has not been made on adding them to either list to get critical habitat protections –  which prompted the group to file the lawsuit.
“These are some of the most imperiled salamanders on the planet and they can’t wait any longer for protections,” said Will Harlan, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Without federal action these salamanders will go extinct on our watch.”
The conservation groups fear that much of the salamander’s populations have been wiped out due to mining and road construction in the mountains where the species is solely found. The petition estimated that only about 200-400 of the salamanders remain across its range. If they were listed as endangered species, then their habitat would be safeguarded by law and require the federal government to create a plan on how to boost the population.
Petitioners identified that the yellow-spotted woodland salamanders not only experience habitat loss but are faced with disease, pollution, and invasive species challenges. 
“Appalachia is a global biodiversity hotspot for salamanders, with more salamander species than anywhere else in the world,” the Center said in a release about the lawsuit. “Today 60% of salamander species are threatened with extinction.”
This comes as the Department of Interior recently announced plans to roll back portions of the Endangered Special Act. Those changes would narrow what could be considered critical habitat and potentially limit the species that can be placed on the protection lists.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Legislative Correspondents Association pool.)Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted has taken at least $75,000 in campaign contributions from Centene, the largest Medicaid managed-care provider in the United States. Of that, more than $29,000 came after the company paid $88.3 million to settle allegations that it had fraudulently extracted tens of millions from Ohio Medicaid.
Meanwhile, Husted has repeatedly voted against extending subsidies for 600,000 Ohioans who are now seeing their health insurance skyrocket. One of the reasons he has cited is fraudulent activity in the program during the coronavirus pandemic.
When Centene paid the settlement, then-Lt. Gov. Husted was part of the administration that was in charge of the program that had allegedly been defrauded. 
The administration of Husted and Gov. Mike DeWine suspended contract negotiations with Centene for a few months in 2021. But taxpayer dollars flowed again after Centene hired an old friend of DeWine’s to lobby the officials on its behalf.
Husted’s office didn’t respond to questions for this story — including whether he thinks it’s important to fight fraud. 
DeWine appointed Husted to the U.S. Senate at the beginning of 2025 after he spent six years in an administration marked by one of the biggest corruption scandals in Ohio history.
Catherine Turcer, executive director of the watchdog group Common Cause Ohio, said it’s disconcerting that Husted took big donations from a company that had paid millions to settle allegations of massive fraud against Ohio taxpayers.
“We expect our elected officials to turn their backs on donors who have committed fraud,” she said. “We expect them to step away and repudiate that. One way they can do that is by refusing campaign contributions.”
Tax cuts for the rich, but no health subsidies for the modest

Husted voted last summer for President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which cuts more than $1 trillion over 10 years from Medicaid and federal food assistance to the poor. At the same time, it extended Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, providing a $1 trillion windfall to the richest 1% of Americans, and adding $4.1 trillion to the national debt.
But while Husted voted to extend tax cuts heavily tilted toward the wealthy, he repeatedly voted against extending 2021 subsidies for 600,000 moderate-income Ohioans to buy health insurance in a marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act. About 70% of the people using the ACA exchanges make 250% or less of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of four, that’s $80,375 a year.
Before the subsidies expired at the end of 2025, experts predicted that expiration would cause premiums to more than double, on average. 
Now that they have expired, that appears to be the case. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that nationally, enrollment has already dropped by 1.4 million. 
That’s about 6% of the 24.2 million Americans who get insurance from the program. Experts told the paper that if the subsidies aren’t reimplemented, that number likely will rise, and many who stop using the ACA marketplace will no longer be insured.
After a 43-day government shutdown in a fight over the subsidies, Husted took to the Senate floor in November to propose freezing the amount spent on the subsidies, adding further restrictions, and extending them, but just for two years. 
He also proposed requiring everybody to pay something, no matter how poor they were. He said that would stop a problem with fraud that the Commonwealth Fund said already had been largely fixed, while proposing further steps that didn’t involve making the poorest pay.
Fraud in Ohio Medicaid
Concerns about fraud were addressed in 2021 when the administration to which Husted belonged decided to resume business with Centene. The company owns Buckeye Community Health Plan, one of the Medicaid managed-care providers that administered much of the $28 billion the department spent that year.
Managed-care providers act in many respects like insurers — with the major difference being that taxpayers pick up the tab. They sign up clients, create provider networks and they pay claims.
They also work with pharmacy middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. Those companies decide which drugs are covered, negotiate non-transparent rebates with drugmakers, and they decide how much to reimburse pharmacies that purchase and dispense them. 
In 2017, while DeWine was still Ohio attorney general and Husted was secretary of state, two PBMs charged taxpayers far, far more for drugs than they were reimbursing pharmacists. 
A 2018 audit of the opaque system showed the PBMs — part health conglomerates CVS Health and UnitedHealth — charged the state $224 million more for drugs in 2017 than they paid Ohio pharmacists, who even then were closing their doors at an alarming rate.
Centene-owned Buckeye Community Health Plan added its own PBM to transactions that were already running through the CVS PBM. Centene charged taxpayers an additional $20 million in 2017. 
Centene denied that it was double-dipping — even though it and CVS were unable to point to any unique services the Centene PBM provided.
Despite its denials, incoming Attorney General Dave Yost in 2019 launched an investigation and filed a lawsuit in 2021. 
Just three months later, Centene settled with the state for $88.3 million. It didn’t admit wrongdoing, but it also announced that it was setting aside more than $1 billion to settle similar claims with more than 20 other states that hadn’t even sued it.
“Centene used sophisticated moves to bill unearned dollars — moves known only at the top levels of health care companies,” Yost said in a written statement announcing the settlement. “It has taken a huge effort by my team to untangle this scheme — and now that we know how it works, the alarm bells should be ringing for anyone using similar tactics.”

Husted is a long-standing opponent of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s signature law. 
“I wasn’t in Congress when Democrats created the broken ACA system or the Biden (health care) subsidies… ,” he said last month.
Despite Husted’s criticism, his supporter Centene owes its massive size and much of its current identity to the ACA. 
Its annual revenue was just $4.45 billion in 2010. That figure mushroomed to $163 billion in 2024, largely by providing Medicaid managed care.
Through it all, it has supported Husted’s political career with donations, giving his campaigns $75,000 over the past two decades.
Turcer of Common Cause said people and companies don’t make donations of that size for the mere sake of good government.
“When you look at why someone gives $50 to a candidate, it’s probably because they really like that candidate,” she said. “But when you start getting into thousands of dollars, those folks want something. They want a policy, they want to develop a relationship so that they can get their phone calls returned quickly. They are making those larger contributions as a way to grease the wheels.”
At the beginning of 2021, as Yost was investigating Centene’s dealings with Ohio Medicaid, the company hired Michael Kiggin, DeWine’s law school classmate and close associate. Kiggin signed on to to lobby DeWine, Yost, Husted, and the Medicaid department on “decisions regarding Medicaid managed care” on Centene’s behalf.
During the fraud investigation, the Medicaid department suspended negotiations over a managed-care contract for 2022. But two months after a settlement was announced, the Medicaid department announced it was resuming business with the company — without mentioning the fraud allegations.
And while Husted continues to have problems with the Affordable Care Act and fraud in its subsidy program, he has not voiced any problem with Centene — a company that has benefitted greatly from the ACA and was credibly accused of defrauding millions from Ohio Medicaid.
A year ago, DeWine appointed Husted to fill the U.S. Senate seat that was vacated by JD Vance when the latter was elevated to the vice presidency. 
Since June, Centene executives have contributed $29,000 to Husted’s effort to be elected in his own right next year, according to records at the Federal Election Commission. 
Meanwhile, company executives appear not to have contributed anything during this cycle to Husted’s likely Democratic challenger, former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown.
Turcer said elected officials shouldn’t take political contributions from companies that are credibly accused of ripping off taxpayers.
“If our elected officials don’t turn their back on those who are engaged in shenanigans and focus on protecting Ohioans and our pocketbooks, we’re all going to be taken advantage of,” she said.

(Photo by Molly Rains, New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire and its counties may soon be barred from enrolling publicly owned lands in carbon sequestration programs.
“We don’t see sequestration as a traditional use,” said Rep. Mike Ouellet, a Colebrook Republican, at a hearing before the House Committee on Municipal and County Government on Tuesday. The committee later voted, 13-1, to recommend passage of House Bill 1205, which would prohibit “carbon sequestration projects” on state- and county-owned lands.
Forest carbon sequestration is the process through which trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas released in large volumes by the burning of fossil fuels, from the atmosphere. Then, trees lock that carbon away for storage by converting it into plant matter. Disturbances like logging and wildfires cause forests to release some carbon back into the atmosphere.
Healthy forests sequester carbon naturally as they grow. Through carbon sequestration contracts, landowners monetize that ability, often marketing it to companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon “credits” elsewhere.
The contracts that form the basis of sequestration projects vary. They may permit a range of management practices or require a hands-off approach, and they typically last anywhere from a couple decades to a century, according to Steven Roberge, forest resources state specialist with the University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension.
No county- or state-owned land is currently listed on the registry of New Hampshire carbon sequestration projects maintained by the Division of Natural and Cultural Resources. But the long duration of forest carbon contracts and the possibility they would impose restrictions on land use were two reasons bill proponents cited for preventing them on public lands in the future.
“It’s very clear how New Hampshire wants to use its forests, its land, that it’s used for the public enjoyment and not strangled by somehow entering into 100-year contracts,” said Executive Councilor Joseph Kenney, who represents the state’s northern district, at the hearing.
Others said timber harvest could be an important source of revenue for counties and the state, and worried the contracts would have a negative impact on the timber industry. Ouellet, who introduced the bill on behalf of prime sponsor and Milan Republican Rep. Arnold Davis, said sequestration was not one of the traditional uses of public lands.
“We bought that land, as taxpayers, with certain expectations of what it was going to be used for,” he said. “Tying it up … feels like a break in trust.”
Rep. Alvin See, a Loudon Republican, also spoke in favor of the bill. He requested an amendment to add cities and towns to the list of entities that cannot enroll lands in the program, “so that there’s no question that it applies to all public land.”
However, Matt Lahey, public policy director for the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, spoke in opposition to the bill. Carbon sequestration projects can bring revenue to forest landowners, including counties or the state, he said. He also spoke in opposition to a blanket prohibition on such projects as proposed by the bill.
“We take that position acknowledging that there are a whole bunch of questions about these forest carbon markets,” he said, “but we also believe, the forest society believes, that these types of programs could be one option for a forest landowner to generate some more revenue.”
Carbon sequestration and carbon storage are two of the many resources forests offer and can be managed to maximize, Roberge said in a phone interview. But such management strategies don’t always need to occur in the absence of other land uses. Different markets for carbon credits carry different levels of expectation for forest management and use. While some are strict, others allow some activity such as selective timber harvesting, he said. 
The UNH Extension does not advocate for or against any particular management strategy, said Roberge, who added that managing a forest for just one resource like timber or carbon is generally ineffective.
At the hearing, one landowner said carbon sequestration projects often required hands-off management that defers logging to prioritize mature and old-growth trees. 
Mature and old-growth forests are important ecologically and for carbon storage: They store multiple times more carbon than younger, managed forests, and can also continue to accumulate large volumes of carbon if left alone, according to a 2025 study by researchers at the Woodwell Climate Research Center and Wild Heritage.
But one thing that’s often misunderstood about forests and carbon, Roberge said, is the different roles played by forests of different ages. While mature and old-growth forests are important for carbon storage, young, rapidly growing forests have an important role to play, too: as they grow, they rapidly capture the element and sequester it away.
“I think about forest carbon as a bank account,” Roberge said. “Sequestration is the interest rate and storage is the balance. The higher the interest rate, the more your balance grows. … (Old growth) forests are definitely beneficial to have, but so are very young forests. That diversity is very important. We need all those things on the landscape.”
Rep. Julie Gilman, an Exeter Democrat, suggested the statute be changed to an enabling statute, allowing counties or the state to take action themselves and opt-in to prohibiting carbon sequestration projects on their lands. 
“Every county is different,” Gilman said, adding that counties could consider their landscape and timber availability when deciding whether to allow such projects.
“Under current law, counties are permitted to enter into contracts with businesses and other organizations,” said Rep. Laurel Stavis, a Lebanon Democrat. The bill, as proposed, would set up carbon sequestration programs as the only businesses counties could not engage with, she said. But Ouellet said he felt that restriction was justified to honor the intended use of public land.
Ultimately, Gilman was the only representative on the committee to vote against recommending the bill.
A House study committee is currently tasked with studying the topic of carbon sequestration, including the tax impact and policy around the practice, and its impact on forest management and the timber industry. A moratorium on new sequestration contracts on both public and privately owned land over 500 acres is in place until November 2027.

Getty ImagesNearly three-quarters of all state student aid money nationwide was based on financial need rather than merit in the 2022-2023 school year, according to the College Board.
In Georgia, that number was around 1%.
Georgia is an outlier when it comes to the money available for college students without the money for an education or the grades and test scores for a merit-based scholarship.
But that could be changing with the expansion of the University of Georgia Foundation’s DREAMS Scholarship program announced by Gov. Brian Kemp Thursday.
Kemp proposed a one-time investment of $325 million in state funding for the program, which is seen as a potential companion to the merit-based HOPE Scholarship launched in 1993 under Gov. Zell Miller.
“In this era of high prices and new challenges for those graduating from high school, we also recognize the advantage need-based financial assistance can give to those who would not otherwise be able to access higher education,” Kemp said in an address to the state Legislature.
“Like their peers who have the means to attend college, these students have great dreams for rewarding careers and impactful lives, but they do not always have hope that those dreams can become reality,” he added.
The new scholarship could provide up to $3,000 to students who meet qualifications, including that they work or volunteer at least part time. Recipients also need to be Georgia residents, demonstrate financial need after all their other scholarships and grants are considered and complete a financial literacy course.
Georgia student loan borrowers have the second-highest average student loan balance in the nation at $42,300, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Of the $325 million, $25 million would be direct scholarship money, and the rest would serve as seed money for an endowment, the proceeds of which the foundation would withdraw from every year to pay for the scholarships. The plan is to grow the endowment so it could support offering tens of millions of dollars in aid to students.
Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, called the plan “a tremendous victory.”
“This is a work of labor of a good nine years from people around the state, committed educators and counselors who saw students just falling through the cracks because their families were not in a position to write a check for their higher education financing,” she said.
Orrock chaired a Senate committee that met several times last year to study college affordability. That committee estimated that annual funding of over $120 million could have funded about 99,000 students per year, Orrock said. The committee also recommended using money from the Georgia Lottery’s unrestricted reserve to pay for scholarships, a pot of money Kemp and his fellow Republicans have been loath to draw from for recurring expenses.
Orrock said she was unbothered that Kemp’s proposal did not match the committee recommendations.
“We’re on the road, and we’re optimistic that there’s going to be broad buy-in for this vision,” she said. “And as we see the success rate, the successes that come from it, we’re going to continue to build it to fully fill the need that’s out there.”
Ashley Young, senior education analyst with the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said advocates have been calling for needs-based aid in Georgia for decades and called the plan exciting but said she will be waiting to see further details, especially what kind of financial need students will need to demonstrate.
“It’s a little bit hard to understand how much of an impact it can make, just because we don’t have some of those specifics answered,” she said. “But certainly the model of ensuring that we are establishing a program that is based solely on student need and not merit is a step in the right direction.”
State Rep. Chuck Martin, an Alpharetta Republican who chairs the House Higher Education Committee, expressed confidence that the program will benefit Georgia students.
“I don’t have all the details, but I have great trust in the governor for putting that in the budget,” he said. “So I look forward to working with them on what’s necessary to see the implementation. We just want to see the investments that are made be productive, and I’m sure they have a plan to do that.”

For researchers whose communities have not historically been represented in science – including many people of color, LGBTQ+ and first-generation scientists – identity is intertwined with how they engage in and share their work.
As researchers who ourselves belong to communities that have been underrepresented in science, we work with scientists from marginalized backgrounds to study how they navigate STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – spaces. What happens when sharing science with the public is treated as relationship-building rather than a one-way transfer of information? We want to understand the role that identity plays in building community in science.
We found that broadening the ways scientists work with the public can bolster trust in science, expand who feels they belong in STEM spaces and ensure that science is working in service of community needs.
 STEM spaces as an obstacle course

Science communication involves bridging knowledge gaps between scientists and the broader community. Traditionally, researchers do it through public lectures, media interviews, press releases, social media posts or outreach events designed to explain science in simpler terms. The goals of these activities are often to correct misconceptions, increase scientific literacy and encourage the general public to trust scientific institutions.
However, science communication can look different for researchers from marginalized backgrounds. For these scientists, the ways they engage with the public often focus on identity and belonging. The researchers we interviewed spoke about hosting bilingual workshops with local families, creating comics about climate change with Indigenous youth and starting podcasts where scientists of color share their pathways into STEM.
Instead of disseminating science information through traditional methods that leave little room for dialogue, these researchers seek to bring science back to their communities. This is in part because scientists from historically marginalized backgrounds often face hostile environments in STEM, including discrimination, stereotypes about their competence, isolation and a lack of representation in their fields. Many of the researchers we talked to described feeling pressure to hide aspects of their identities, being seen as the token minority, or having to constantly prove they belong. These experiences reflect well-documented structural barriers in STEM that shape who feels welcome and supported in scientific environments.
We wanted to see if a broader definition of science communication that incorporates identity as an asset can expand who feels welcomed in scientific spaces, strengthen trust between scientists and communities, and ensure scientific knowledge is shared in culturally relevant and accessible ways.
 Transforming STEM communication

Prior studies have found that scientists tend to prioritize communication focused on conveying information, placing much less emphasis on understanding audiences, building trust or fostering dialogue. Our research, however, suggests that marginalized scientists adopt communication styles that are more inclusive.
Our team set out to create training spaces for researchers from communities that have been historically marginalized in science. Since 2018, we have been facilitating ReclaimingSTEM workshops both in-person and online, where over 700 participants have been encouraged to explore the intersections of their identities and science through interactive modules, small-group activities and community-building discussions.
Expanding what counts as science communication is essential for it to be effective. This is particularly relevant for scientists whose work and identities call for approaches grounded in community connection, cultural relevance and reciprocity. In our workshops, we broadly defined science communication as community engagement about science that could be both formal and informal, including through media, art, music, podcasts and outreach in schools, among others.
While some participants mentioned using traditional science communication approaches – like making topics concise and clear, as well as avoiding jargon – most used communication styles and methods that are more audience-centered, identity-focused and emotion-driven.

Some participants drew on their audience’s cultural backgrounds when sharing their research. One participant described explaining biological pattern formation by connecting it to familiar artistic traditions in her community, such as the geometric and floral designs used in henna. Using imagery that her audience recognized helped make the scientific concepts more relatable and encouraged deeper engagement.
Rather than portray science as something neutral or emotionless, participants infused empathy and feeling into their community engagement. For example, one scientist shared with us that his experiences of exclusion as a multiracial gay man shaped how he approached his interactions. These feelings helped him be more patient, understanding and attentive when others struggled to grasp scientific ideas. By drawing on his own sense of not belonging, he aimed to create an environment where people could connect emotionally to his research and feel supported in the learning process.
Participants found it important to incorporate their identities into their communication styles. For some, this meant not assimilating into the dominant norms of science spaces and instead authentically expressing their identities to be a role model to others. For example, one participant explained that openly identifying as disabled helped normalize that experience for others.
Many felt a deep sense of responsibility to have their science engagement be of service to their communities. One scientist who identified as a Black woman said she often thinks about how her research may affect people of color, and how to communicate her findings in ways that everyone can understand and benefit from.

 Making STEM more inclusive

While the participants of our workshop had a variety of goals when it came to science communication, a common thread was their desire to build a sense of belonging in STEM.
We found that marginalized scientists often draw on their lived experiences and community connections when teaching and speaking about their research. Other researchers have also found that these more inclusive approaches to science communication can help build trust, create emotional resonance, improve accessibility and foster a stronger sense of belonging among community members.

Centering the perspectives and identities of marginalized researchers would make science communication training programs more inclusive and responsive to community needs. For example, some participants described tailoring their science outreach to audiences with limited English proficiency, particularly within immigrant communities. Others emphasized communicating science in culturally relevant ways to ensure information is accessible to people in their home communities. Several also expressed a desire to create welcoming and inclusive spaces where their communities could see themselves represented and supported in STEM.
One scientist who identified as a disabled woman shared that accessibility and inclusivity shape her language and the information she communicates. Rather than talking about her research, she said, her goal has been more about sharing the so-called hidden curriculum for success: the unwritten norms, strategies and knowledge key to secure opportunities, and thrive in STEM.
 Identity for science communication

Identity is central to how scientists navigate STEM spaces and how they communicate science to the audiences and communities they serve.
For many scientists from marginalized backgrounds, the goal of science communication is to advocate, serve and create change in their communities. The participants in our study called for a more inclusive vision of science communication: one grounded in identity, storytelling, community and justice. In the hands of marginalized scientists, science communication becomes a tool for resistance, healing and transformation. These shifts foster belonging, challenge dominant norms and reimagine STEM as a space where everyone can thrive.
Helping scientists bring their whole selves into how they choose to communicate can strengthen trust, improve accessibility and foster belonging. We believe redesigning science communication to reflect the full diversity of those doing science can help build a more just and inclusive scientific future.

Many states are reporting fewer new enrollees, more people dropping their coverage, and more people choosing cheaper and less generous health insurance plans with higher deductibles.
Across most states, Thursday was the last day to enroll for plans that start in February. But nine states and Washington, D.C., have deadlines later this month, so the numbers could change.
There are 21 states with state-run health insurance marketplaces, and the rest use the federal website. The vast majority of states have seen declines in enrollment so far, compared with around this time last year.
Preliminary data released Monday by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services shows 22.8 million enrollees, down from a record total of 24.3 million last year.
Premiums have surged as a result of the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies first made available by the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act. The availability of the subsidies spurred a sharp increase in the number of people buying health plans on the marketplaces. In 2020, 11.4 million people were enrolled in marketplaces through Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. More than double that amount enrolled last year.
Dozens of states tackle high prescription drug costs

Congress failed to reach an agreement on extending the subsidies before the end of last year and still hasn’t reached one. As a result, premiums were expected to increase this year by 114% on average — from $888 last year to about $1,904, according to estimates made in September by health policy research organization KFF.
The higher costs appear to be driving many people to forgo insurance or opt for cheaper, less generous plans this year, health officials and analysts say. Several states with state-based marketplaces — including Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, Virginia and Washington — are reporting fewer enrollments this year in comparison with enrollments through early January 2025, according to early data. Other states, such as California, are reporting fewer new enrollees.
“It’s important to consider that this is preliminary data, so this represents people who have signed up and selected the plan — but they probably haven’t received their first premium bill,” said Elizabeth Lukanen, executive director of the health policy research organization State Health Access Data Assistance Center at the University of Minnesota. “Once that happens, I think there’s concern — and it seems very possible — that people may decide to drop coverage. So, the decline could get bigger.
“On the other hand, open enrollment hasn’t closed, so you have two things sort of competing. It seems pretty likely that there will be a decline,” she said.
If the downward trend continues, the nation could see the first decline in enrollment since 2020, Lukanen said, adding that a full picture of income levels and demographics of people who have dropped coverage won’t be clear until the summer.
In Pennsylvania, data updated through Tuesday shows more than 15,000 previously enrolled adults between the ages of 55 and 64 have dropped coverage entirely — the most of any age bracket.
Pennsylvania’s state-based exchange, Pennie, has seen about 15% fewer new enrollments compared with last year. The state is also reporting 1,000 residents dropping coverage per day during open enrollment — with the most coverage losses among people with incomes 150% to 200% of the poverty level. These could include families of two adults and two children with an income between $48,225 and $64,300.
The state is seeing an “unprecedented” number of previously enrolled people dropping coverage, said Devon Trolley, executive director of the Pennsylvania Health Insurance Exchange Authority.

California is reporting 31% fewer new enrollees this year compared with last year, and more than a third of new enrollees are choosing bronze plans — the lowest, least generous coverage tier — up from less than a quarter at this time last year.
In Minnesota, data as of Dec. 3 shows more than half of active enrollees are opting to keep their coverage tier. But of those changing plans, more than a third — 37% — are going to cheaper plans. The state notes a full picture won’t be available until March.
Meanwhile, some states are seeing roughly the same number of enrollees or more. Texas, for example, is reporting about 4.1 million people enrolling this year compared with 4 million last year.
Charles Miller, health and economic mobility policy director at Texas 2036, a policy research nonprofit, said it’s unclear why enrollments are up, but pointed to some clues.
“Texas had a uniquely large population of uninsured individuals eligible for free and inexpensive plans that hadn’t enrolled previously … [and] has more affordable bronze and gold plans than many states,” he said.
He attributes that to a bipartisan state law, enacted in 2021, that had the effect of increasing subsidies for those plans, Miller said.
Nevada is seeing fewer enrollees overall. But compared with this time last year, the state is seeing 29% more people who are actively shopping the website to explore plans, said Katie Charleson, communications officer at the Nevada Health Authority Division of Consumer Health Services.
The state introduced a new public option, according to the Nevada Current, and health officials told lawmakers last week that about 1 in 5 people are opting for that plan.
One Big Beautiful Bill Act complicates state health care affordability efforts

In addition to the expiration of the subsidies, the cost of coverage has risen because of other factors, according to insurers. They say they’ve had to raise premiums because of rising prescription drug costs, inflation and workforce challenges, such as provider shortages.
But the enhanced premium tax credits were aimed at buffering those year-to-year changes for Americans with lower incomes, said Trolley, adding that the tax credit structure “helps make sure that [enrollees] don’t see those really larger drops that happen from time to time, sort of from those market forces.”
“When there are broader rate increases of … the total cost of the coverage, the tax credits are structured so that people who get a tax credit don’t feel a lot of that increase. They’re sort of sheltered from it on a year to year basis,” Trolley said. “The tax credit is tied to someone’s income and limits what they pay as part of their income, not necessarily tied to the cost of the coverage.”
She added that she’s also heard from some residents who say they are waiting to enroll in a plan to see if Congress takes action.
“People are leaving the ACA marketplace because the trade-offs have just become harder to justify,” Lukanen said. “What worries me is that when the coverage becomes unaffordable, it isn’t that people suddenly stop needing care. They just lose the protection that insurance offers, and those health care costs don’t go away.”











If people are going to the doctor and they don't have insurance, these costs are then just shifted.

Lukanen added that if more people forgo coverage, health care services may end up costing the nation more overall.
“If people are going to the doctor and they don’t have insurance, these costs are then just shifted. They’re shifted to hospitals, ultimately to the community and the taxpayer.”
Trolley echoed that, saying she’s concerned about the overall burden on providers in rural counties, which are seeing the highest drops in Obamacare coverage in Pennsylvania.
“Any increase in the uninsured rate is going to further strain providers that are in rural areas, especially — further strain their financial situation,” she said. “We are very concerned about that in Pennsylvania.”
