(Photo posted by Meskwaki Nation Police Department Facebook page)The Meskwaki Nation police chief has identified his son as one of the two Iowa National Guard members killed in Syria Saturday.
The two service members were killed by a lone gunman suspected to be affiliated with ISIS, according to information released Saturday. The identities of the soldiers who died in the attack were not officially released as of Sunday evening, but Iowa Army National Guard officials were expected to officially share more information after next of kin has been notified.
In a social media post late Saturday, Meskwaki Nation Police Chief Jeffrey Bunn wrote that his son, Sgt. Nate Howard, was one of the soldiers killed in the attack.
“My wife Misty and I had that visit from Army Commanders you never want to have,” Bunn wrote. “Our son Nate was one of the Soldiers that paid the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, to keep us all safer. He loved what he was doing and would be the first in and last out, no one left behind. Please pray for our Soldiers all around this cruel world.”
No information has yet been shared about the second soldier or civilian victim of the attack.
Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa National Guard Maj. Gen. Stephen Osborn confirmed Saturday the two soldiers killed in the Palmyra, Syria, were in the Iowa National Guard. Three other soldiers were injured in the attack — one of the injuries was “superficial,” Osborn said, while two others were “significant,” and both were stable but in critical condition receiving treatment at the Jordan air base. One civilian, an interpreter who was not from Iowa, was also killed in the attack.
Reynolds asked Iowans during a Saturday news conference to “stand united” in supporting the victims, their families and all National Guard service members, “especially those who served side by side with the soldiers killed and wounded today,” following the attack.
“Everyone who wears the Iowa National Guard uniform — I can tell you firsthand that this is a family,” Reynolds said. “I’ve seen them close up, working together in any number of challenging situations, and they share a deep bond. Today’s attack and the loss of two of their own weighs heavily on everyone at every level, so please keep all of them and your thoughts and prayers.”
The attack, currently under investigation, occurred “as the soldiers were conducting a key leader engagement,” according to Sean Parnell, the U.S. assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. The soldiers’ mission was in support of ongoing counterterrorism efforts in the area. Osborn said at the Saturday news conference the Iowa National Guard forces in Syria operate as a part of the Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve, an international union led by the U.S. focused on fighting ISIS in the region.
“Our soldiers were doing their job, serving with courage, dedication and professionalism,” Osborn said. “They carried out their mission to the best of their ability, and we are proud of their incredible service and sacrifice, and we will continue to stand strong as a team united in the purpose and resolve their mission.”
There are currently 1,800 Iowa soldiers in the Middle East, Osborn said, deployed in May 2025. Of that group, between 200 and 250 are National Guard members deployed in Syria.
President Donald Trump pledged a strong U.S. response to the ISIS attack in a Truth Social post Saturday mourning the deaths of the three Americans.
“This was an ISIS attack against the U.S., and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them,” Trump write. “The President of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, is extremely angry and disturbed by this attack. There will be very serious retaliation.”
Other Iowa leaders shared their condolences for the fallen soldiers and their families following the news Saturday. U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, a veteran who served with the Iowa National Guard, asked Iowans to join her “in praying for the families of these American heroes.”
“Our Iowa National Guard family is hurting as we mourn the loss of two of our own and pray for the recovery of the three soldiers wounded,” Ernst said in a statement. “These soldiers were carrying out a critical mission in combatting the threat of ISIS and keeping our homeland safe from the threat of radical Islamic terror. This tragic attack is a reminder that freedom is not free and that every American owes an enormous debt of gratitude to our brave men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line every day.”
The last death of an Iowa National Guard member in service occurred in 2011 in Afghanistan.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said the deaths of the Iowa National Guard members was “absolutely shocking news” in a statement Saturday.
“The National Guard represents the best of us – citizens always ready to protect and serve their neighbors,” Hart said. “May the families of these brave Iowa soldiers know that the entire state of Iowa grieves for them and send our sincerest sympathies to them for their unbelievable loss.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/nationalguard.photo_-1024x725.jpg,,,2025-12-14 20:57:43.623622

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)PROVIDENCE — It was supposed to be a joyful event. But a Christmas tree and menorah lighting scheduled for late Sunday afternoon at Lippitt Memorial Park was turned into a vigil for the victims of Saturday’s shooting at Brown University.
Despite the mid-20-degree weather and falling snow in Providence, over 200 people gathered to light candles to honor the two students who were killed and nine others who were wounded inside the Barus and Holley engineering building.
Councilor Sue AnderBois began the holiday event at the park near the Pawtucket line last year.
“Instead, we are gathered here to share light with one another in one of Providence’s darkest times,” AnderBois told the crowd. “We’re here together to be together and to support.”

AnderBois was joined by several of Rhode Island’s elected officials including Gov. Dan McKee, who earlier in the afternoon ordered flags at all state buildings and facilities to be lowered to half-staff as a sign of respect for the victims of the shooting.
McKee did not speak during the vigil, nor did most elected officials in attendance. Remarks during the 10-minute ceremony were given by AnderBois, Mayor Brett Smiley and Sarah Mack, senior rabbi of Temple Beth-El near Wayland Square in Providence.
Smiley, who converted to Judaism last year, invoked the first night of Hanukkah in his remarks, noting that the initial lighting of the menorah represents a small spark that grows into a bright light by the end of the eight-night festival. He said he hoped the vigil would be “the first little flicker for our community to start to heal and get better together.”
“It’s going to be a long road, but what I know about this community is that we will be here for one another,” Smiley said.
Mack similarly spoke of the need for Rhode Islanders to come together as a way to provide light in these dark times.
“We can use our light to kindle other lights — to care for one another,” she said. “That is how we get through this dark moment.”
After Mack concluded her speech, the crowd spontaneously began to sing “Amazing Grace.” Officials had no further press briefings scheduled for Sunday night on the status of their investigation.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The person of interest detained overnight as part of the massive investigation of Saturday’s mass shooting at a Brown University engineering building has yet to be criminally charged. Two people were killed and nine were injured.
A man in his twenties was apprehended early Sunday morning at a Coventry hotel, approximately 15 miles away from the Ivy League campus in Providence. But Col. Oscar Perez, chief of Providence police, declined to say if he is the same person of interest depicted in video footage released by law enforcement Saturday night.
“We’re in the process of collecting evidence. We’re in the process of typing search warrants as needed and we’re in the process of doing what we need to do in order to get those items,” Perez told reporters at a noon press conference at the Brook Street Station at the edge of Brown’s East Side campus.
‘The unthinkable has happened.’ 2 killed, nine injured in mass shooting on Brown University campus

“While it may be frustrating for certain members of our community to feel like we’re not being fully forthcoming with details, the reason is that we’re not sharing details that are unconfirmed is that it could compromise our prosecution,” Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said.
As Perez was taking a question from a reporter who used the term “custody” referring to the person of interest, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, the state’s top prosecutor, who was standing beside Perez leaned in.
“Custody’s the wrong word,” Neronha whispered to Perez.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said he had spoken to four of the eight shooting victims who were still hospitalized at Rhode Island Hospital. One had been discharged. Brown President Christina H. Paxson said she had spoken to all but one of the hospitalized students. 
Brown is not yet releasing names as not all victims’ families have been notified. Paxson on Saturday night confirmed that she had spoken to the families of the two students who died.
As the noon press conference was happening, news crews from around the region waited outside the Hampton Inn on Centre of New England Boulevard in Coventry. Crime scene tape blocked off the entrance to the hotel while FBI and ATF agents were inside. But details about the progress of the investigation were scarce.  
Law enforcement agents were seen looking inside vents below two windows on the first floor of the hotel’s west side. They pointed to an upper floor.

FBI Director Kash Patel in a social media post Sunday credited a lead called into Providence Police, describing a “person of interest in a hotel room in Coventry,” as the impetus for the search team’s successful apprehension of the suspect. The search team included members of the FBI Boston field office’s Safe Streets Task Force, along with the U.S. Marshals Service and Coventry police, according to Patel.
“This FBI will continue an all out 24/7 campaign until justice is fully served,” Patel wrote on X.
Kristen Setera, a spokesperson for the FBI, referred to Patel’s social media post when asked for additional comment Sunday.
A dispatcher for the Coventry Police Department declined to answer questions when contacted by phone Sunday afternoon, referring a reporter to the local FBI office. 
Federal investigators are still working to gather evidence and reconstruct the shooting scene. They have also set up a digital portal to take in photos and videos submitted by the public that might be helpful, Patel said on X.
Perez repeatedly declined to answer questions about the person of interest, how he was found, or any potential connections to the university, explaining that he did not want to compromise the ongoing investigation.
“I’m pretty confident in the work that the men and women have done for the department, but I gotta respect their work,” Perez said. “Some of them haven’t gone to sleep. I have to respect the fact that they’re going to continue to give us what we need in order to be able to prosecute somebody properly.”

Perez rebuffed questions about lack of camera footage from the university’s expansive footprint across College Hill, including in the engineering building where the shooting took place. 
The university relied on its internal text message alert system to tell students, administrators and faculty about the situation. But the three outdoor sirens across its main campus were not activated due to the fast-moving nature of the crisis, said Rodney Chatman, the university’s director of public safety and emergency management.
Smiley acknowledged the need for further scrutiny about safety measures and policies at a later date.
“There will be plenty of time to talk about what advocacy and policy changes should be made but we’re still very much at work at the task at hand, and that is to be able to bring charges forward on the person responsible,” Smiley said.
By midday Sunday, evidence of the crime scene that engulfed the residential neighborhoods around the university had been removed. All roads were reopened except for the immediate area around the Barus and Holley engineering building on Hope Street, Smiley said. City officials and law enforcement expect to provide more updates when available Sunday but from a different venue: the Providence Public Safety Complex on Washington Street in downtown.
Somber Sunday on campus
About an inch and a half of snow dusted the campus overnight through Sunday morning. An impromptu memorial of flowers had formed outside Brown University’s Engineering Research Center around noon. Standing alone at the display was Katelyn Meyer, a Ph.D. student in chemical engineering.
“It’s so quiet this morning,” she told Rhode Island Current. “On the one hand, it feels kind of peaceful. On the other, it feels very somber.”
Meyer works inside the Barus and Holley engineering building — a structure she assumed would be safe in the event of a lockdown. There are no windows inside, all the doors are cinderblock — some of which require keypads to open, Meyer said. She had been scheduled to be in her office Monday, but the engineering building continues to be an active crime scene.
“I’ll be honest, I really don’t want to go back in,” Meyer said.

Paxson got emotional at the end of the press conference as she described talking with students at the university’s main dining hall Sunday morning.
“It is a big shift and not the way we hope to end this semester obviously,” Paxon said.” A lot of students gathered there. They are amazing, and they are supporting each other. … The students on campus There’s just a lot of gratitude right now. They’re remarkable.”
Brown continued to inform its campus community and the public with updates to its website.   
An update from Brown’s ​​Vice President for Campus Life Patricia Poitevien posted to Brown’s website at 12:03 p.m. listed resources for students still on campus, such as food and the availability of police escorts to help students retrieve their belongings from dorms. 
“When I was at the hospital today, one of the students that showed tremendous courage literally said to me, ‘You know that active shooter drill they made me do in high school helped me in the moment,’” Smiley said during the press conference, “which at the same time provided me hope and was so sad. We shouldn’t have to do active shooter drills but it helped.”
Laura Paton contributed to this story.



A public vigil hosted by Providence City Councilor Sue AnderBois and the Providence City Council is scheduled for 5 p.m. Sunday at Lippitt Memorial Park in Providence. The event was originally planned as a tree and Menorah lighting to celebrate the holidays. There will be security in place for the safety of attendees. 
Family Service of Rhode Island is working with the state, city of Providence and Brown University to offer crisis support to the community. There is a drop-in center at 55 Hope St. in Providence, open until 5 p.m. Sunday and again 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. There is also support by phone at (401) 854-6678.
Additional resources are available on the city of Providence website.

Courtesy photo. Kendall Qualls, Army veteran, former health care executive and anti-anti-racist activist, won the Minnesota Republican gubernatorial straw poll on Saturday, beating House Speaker Lisa Demuth, MyPillow guy Mike Lindell and a long list of other names.
The poll of the party’s State Central Committee offers the first look at how the candidates in the 2026 governor’s race are positioned among roughly 300 of the party’s most engaged activists leading up to precinct caucuses on Feb. 3, which will begin the process of selecting the 2,300 delegates to the party’s all-important endorsement convention in May.
Qualls won votes from 93 delegates, followed by Demuth with 90 and Lindell with 49, according to the state party.
Much can change before the party convention, and candidates with weak showings in the straw poll have gone to win the MN GOP nomination. Former state Sen. Scott Jensen finished third in the first Republican straw poll but won the party endorsement in 2022. (Jensen, who is running again, finished seventh this year.)

“I’m a unique candidate as a political outsider and business leader who can energize Republicans and attract a sizable share of swing voters — enough to win decisively in 2026,” Qualls said in a statement celebrating the results of the poll.
Qualls, although popular among party activists, has never won a general election. He finished 11-points behind former U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips in 2020 to represent the purplish suburban 3rd Congressional District. In 2022, Qualls finished behind Jensen at the state nominating convention.
In recent years, Qualls has led the nonprofit Take Charge Minnesota, which promotes “the notion that the promise of America is available to everyone regardless of race or social station,” according to its website.
Demuth led House Republicans during the 2024 election to win a share of power in the 67-67 House, effectively thwarting the Democrats’ legislative agenda this year.
Both frontrunners are Black, which would be a first for Minnesota if either prevails in the Republican primary and against Democratic Gov. Tim Walz in 2026.
Lindell, who’s lost a fortune promoting false claims about rigged election machines, announced his campaign for governor on Thursday from his Shakopee pillow factory and livestreamed it on LindellTV with fellow right-wing influencer and former Trump advisor Steve Bannon.
Prominent attorney Chris Madel celebrated his fourth place showing behind Lindell in a news release, saying he was “genuinely amazed by the level of support shown by delegates from across our great state.”
Rep. Kristin Robbins, a suburbanite whose relative moderation might be an asset in a midterm election that usually favors the party not in the White House, finished a distant sixth.
She entered the race early and has used her position as chair of the House fraud prevention committee to raise her profile by pummeling Walz over fraud in state-run human services programs.
What’s unclear at this point is the role of President Trump in the nominating contest. Lindell has long portrayed himself as a Trump ally, including long-running amplification of Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election. Robbins scrubbed her support for Nikki Haley — who ran against Trump for the GOP nomination in 2024 — from her social media.
Trump and the MAGA movement seem to have a particular disdain for Walz and may be calculating who has the best shot at beating the two-term DFL incumbent.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMGL0519-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-12-14 11:57:29.560874

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s success rate for keeping truancy cases out of court is the lowest it’s been in a decade, according to an annual report presented to a state committee.
The Juvenile Justice Reinvestment Oversight Council is a group of representatives from law enforcement, schools, the Legislature, social services and the court system. It is responsible for tracking South Dakota’s efforts to reduce the number of children in custody.
The group first came together in 2015, following a set of juvenile justice reforms meant to address South Dakota’s status at the time as the state most likely to lock up children. The number of delinquency petitions has decreased from 3,025 in 2014 to 2,489 in 2025.
A delinquency petition is a legal document that launches the juvenile court equivalent of an adult criminal case. Diversion programs typically allow children to avoid such a petition.
Truancy diversion programs redirect chronically absent students and their families away from the justice system by providing support and services to address the cause of the absenteeism.
‘Big gray area’: SD authorities fear alternative instruction means ‘no-schooling’ for some students

The success rate of truancy diversions dropped to 63% in fiscal year 2025, which ran from July 2024 through June 2025. That rate has declined from a high of 97% in 2021.
Truancy can be more than students not attending school, State Court Administrator Greg Sattizahn said at the meeting, since it can be a “reflection of a lot of other things happening” in the child’s life, including “breakdown in a family structure,” abuse or neglect, criminal activity or substance abuse.
“A $100 fine as diversion is not going to address that meaningfully,” Sattizahn said, adding, “There is just a lot that you have to unpack in those truancy cases, so they continue to be a challenge.”
Truancy diversion success rates significantly dropped in fiscal year 2023, following a 2021 law making it easier for parents to pull their children from school and place them in alternative instruction, such as online schooling or homeschooling.
The law change struck down testing requirements and instruction time requirements, and removed a clause that allowed the state’s Department of Education to investigate situations where there’s concern a child might not be getting the instruction they’re required to under state law.
Committee member Rep. Mike Stevens, R-Yankton, told South Dakota Searchlight that the report overall shows that the2015 changes have been largely effective. But truancy, he said, is a “big area that we have to look at as a state.”
Truancy diversions have decreased since the 2021 truancy law changes took effect, gradually dropping to 270 in 2024 and 171 in 2025. There were 694 diversions in 2021 and 565 in 2022.


Parents can avoid potential truancy charges by signing their kids up for homeschooling without accountability, Stevens said.
“We don’t know where those kids are going to school. That’s a real issue,” Stevens said.
Because parents can more easily remove their children from schools, he said, it gives the state less opportunity to intervene.
Stevens plans to address truancy this coming session with a proposal to require families who enroll their child in alternative instruction to tell the state each year where their child is receiving their education.
“I have no problem with someone homeschooling their child or sending them to private school. But there are kids out there that we don’t know if they’re going to school or not,” Stevens said. “That’s a real concern and something that could easily be taken care of.”
Committee member Sen. Red Dawn Foster, D-Pine Ridge, hopes to better understand the “root causes” of youth involvement in the justice system and the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system.
In the case of truancy, she wants to understand the connection between academic achievement, educational opportunities and truancy rates. Foster works with the Boys and Girls Club in Pine Ridge.
Foster told South Dakota Searchlight that understanding ways to not only divert children from the justice system but address “root causes” is more urgent as the Legislature discusses prison construction and rehabilitation reform.
“As Native people, we understand what is happening in our community, and a lot of times we don’t have the resources or data to do something about it,” Foster told South Dakota Searchlight. “If you have the right resources and access to data, you can support others doing phenomenal work to address these issues.”

But police activity will continue in Barus and Holley Engineering Building and the surrounding area that is still considered an active crime scene, according to officials.
Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez declined to share any details about the person in custody or where they were arrested, citing the ongoing investigation into the shooting. All he’d noted was that the person was in their 30s.
WPRI-12 reported that the person was taken into custody without issue at 3:45 a.m. at the Hampton Inn and Suites on Center of New England Boulevard in Coventry. The town’s police department did not immediately respond to request for comment.
A woman who answered the phone at the Hampton Inn said she could not give out any information at this time. “We are working with law enforcement,” she said.
Perez told reporters detectives are now collecting evidence and conducting interviews as part of the investigation.
“From there, we’ll be able to, when it’s appropriate and accurate, to share more details with you all,” he said.
Gov. Dan McKee told reporters the Rhode Island State Police will remain on alert to provide a “sense of calmness in the state.”
“The state of Rhode Island is in shock,” McKee said. 
Of the nine students who were injured and taken to hospital Saturday, seven were in a stable condition, one was in critical but stable condition, and another had been released, Smiley said. 
University President Christina Paxson said Sunday morning the shooting happened inside a classroom where an exam review for an economics class was underway. The Providence Fire department was first alerted about the shooting at 4:05 p.m. 
Brown sent out its first emergency alert at 4:22 p.m., noting “an active shooter near Barus & Holley Engineering.” 
All remaining undergraduate and graduate exams, medical classes, papers and projects for the rest of the fall 2025 semester have since been canceled, Provost Francis J. Doyle III wrote in an update to students at 8:24 a.m.
“In the immediate aftermath of these devastating events, we recognize that learning and assessment are significantly hindered in the short term and that many students and others will wish to depart campus,” Doyle wrote.
Paxson said a couple of thousand students were transported overnight by law enforcement from locations within a police perimeter to an evacuation site in the Olney-Margolies Athletic Center. “We prioritized getting those students to a place where they could rest and receive any necessary resources,” she wrote in a university update. “I am deeply moved by all the students who opened their homes and their arms to welcome friends into their dorms and other residences while we transported others to local hotels.”
The Rhode Island Blood Center put out a call for blood donations.
“Hospitals rely on a ready supply during emergencies,” the Center posted to X.

But their vital work continues to be underpaid, across the country, throughout the state of Michigan, and even here at the University of Michigan (U of M).
The university’s ECE teachers are part of University Staff United, a newly recognized union who is fighting for a contract that would include higher wages for many of the university’s lowest paid full-time workers, including the early childhood educators at all three campuses’ children’s centers.
When I joined Towsley Children’s House in 2012 as a recent graduate with a bachelor’s degree in education, I was offered just $27,000 per year. While the university offered generous health and retirement benefits to offset the lower salary, I was not able to live independently on this wage. I first lived with roommates and then my spouse, who made twice what I made. Even with yearly merit increases, I could only afford to pay about a third of our joint expenses.
After six years at Towsley, we decided I would accept a job at a school in China that paid me twice what I was making at U of M. I had to leave the country to find a school that was willing to pay me a competitive wage! When we moved back to Michigan in 2023, I applied back to Towsley and was offered $42,000. I was eager to return but, as a certified teacher with a Master’s Degree in Early Childhood Education, this was significantly less than what I could earn in area districts like Ann Arbor Public Schools. ECE teacher compensation has been a topic of conversation and concern throughout my time at U of M.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2014, teachers had an informal meeting with HR, where we shared our worries and low pay. Many teachers spoke about how difficult it was to cover all their living expenses without a second job or a spouse. The university’s response was to say they were paying the market rate for ECE teachers and our salaries were not going to change. In 2021, two Towsley teachers spoke anonymously to the Michigan Daily to discuss pay equity for ECE teachers at the university.
The teachers highlighted important aspects of this issue. For example, only a small percentage of our budget comes from university funds. This places the burden of paying our salaries on the families we serve. One of these teachers noted,“The university expects the child care centers to pay for themselves, which in turn raises tuition costs, which is a burden to families and it doesn’t allow for the teachers in our programs to make a living wage.”
In 2023, the University’s Business and Finance division (which oversees Human Resources, Child and Family Care, and the Children’s Centers) rolled out a compensation framework that capped the salary of different roles within the division. Children’s Centers ECE teachers were informed that their maximum salary would be $55,210, regardless of educational attainment or number of years worked at the university.
The most senior teachers, who had regularly received annual merit raises putting them above that salary threshold, were told they had reached their salary cap and would never make more. Understandably, some teachers felt undervalued and chose to leave.
The University of Michigan is not alone in under-paying ECE professionals. Across the country, many of these teachers are paid at or below the federal poverty level and few states are making an effort to change that. Early educators, in particular, are penalized for working with young children. Michigan early educators with a bachelor’s degree are paid 21.5 percent less than their colleagues in the K-8 system. Imagine how the conversation around early childhood educator pay could change with the support of a great institution like the University of Michigan.
Teaching at one of U of M’s Children’s Centers is an honor and a privilege. We provide some of the highest quality early childhood education and care available in our city, county, and state and the quality of our programs are used to attract professionals to the university. It’s time that we are recognized and compensated for being the leaders and the best in our field.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-14 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Donald Trump wants to abolish federal independent boards. Could that occur in Mississippi?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/14/donald-trump-independent-boards-mississippi/,It would be difficult for the state Supreme Court to rule that a board created by the Mississippi Constitution is unconstitutional.,"The state government of Mississippi is packed with agencies and commissions that are governed by independent boards and not by the governor.
President Donald Trump argues such independent boards on the federal level violate the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court recently heard arguments from the Trump administration on the issue, and a ruling next year in favor of the president would be far reaching and upend decades of judicial precedence.
Not long ago, a ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court abolishing the independent or regulatory boards would have been far fetched, but no longer thanks to the current Supreme Court’s willingness to acquiesce to Trump’s whims.
Is the same possible in Mississippi?
Could Gov. Tate Reeves or some future governor challenge the constitutionality of the independent agencies in this state?
Perhaps. 
After all, anybody can file a lawsuit. And it often appears that whatever Trump does, Reeves and many Mississippi politicians want to emulate. But there are some distinct differences between the powers of the governor under the Mississippi Constitution and the powers of the president under the United States Constitution.
Granted, the U.S. Constitution and Mississippi Constitution are similar in terms of the president and the governor both commanding the military, having broad pardon authority and being able to request reports from agencies.
Both the U.S. Congress and the Mississippi Legislature have created agencies with governing board members appointed by either the governor or the president. Often, the board members serve staggered terms, preventing one chief executive officer from appointing all the members.
The purpose of the independent boards – especially on the national level – is to take politics out of the governance, such as with the Federal Election Commission, the Federal Reserve, the National Labor Relations Board, the National Science Board and a host of others.
Trump wants to be able to fire the board members if he does not like their policies.
Mississippi also has multiple instances of the Legislature creating a governance system where appointed board members hire the executive director and set the policies of the agency. The Department of Mental Health, the Department of Health and the Community College Board are examples where, for whatever reason, the Legislature opted to create an agency with the executive director reporting to the board members instead of the governor.
But there are differences between the Mississippi system and the national system.
Some of the independent agencies are created by the Mississippi Constitution (the people) and not by the Legislature.
The Board of Education, arguably one of the state’s more important boards, is created constitutionally with the members appointed by a combination of the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the House. The state’s eight public universities are governed by a constitutionally created Board of Trustees of state Institutions of Higher Learning. The board members serve staggered terms appointed by governors. In some rare instances, one governor elected to two terms could have all the appointments on the IHL Board.
Then, of course, there are statewide elected officials who oversee their agencies. Most of those state positions – the secretary of state, treasurer, auditor, attorney general – are created by the Constitution and do not answer to the governor. But the insurance commissioner and the commissioner of agriculture and commerce are not constitutional officers. They are legislatively created.
It is not certain the U.S. Supreme Court will grant Trump’s wishes and abolish the independent boards, but many judicial experts believe it is possible if not likely.
But what is certain is that Mississippi’s Republican leadership follows the lead of Trump.
Still, it is difficult to see a scenario where a Mississippi governor would take the issue to court.
First of all, it is highly unlikely that the Mississippi Supreme Court would find a board or agency created by the Mississippi Constitution to be unconstitutional. That would be a difficult position for a judge to take.
In addition, a governor who has a strong relationship with lawmakers might have better luck changing the governance of those independent agencies that are not in the Mississippi Constitution by going to the Mississippi Legislature instead of petitioning the Mississippi Supreme Court.
But in the current crazy political climate, it seems anything is possible.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/07003107/MG_1584-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-14 07:56:22.369106

Winooski Superintendent of Schools Wilmer Chavarria testified on Capitol Hill last week about his detention earlier this year by federal authorities in Texas. He filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security the day after testifying, alleging violations of Fourth Amendment protections at the border.
“I accepted to be a plaintiff for this lawsuit because, if we are successful, it can protect the Fourth Amendment rights for all Americans,” he said in an interview with VTDigger.
Chavarria, 36, said he was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials in Houston’s airport on a trip back from visiting family in Nicaragua in July. Federal agents denied him legal counsel, searched his devices without a warrant and told him he did not have constitutional rights at the border, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court Wednesday.

“CBP policies that claim to give its employees the power to search and seize electronic devices without a warrant violate the Fourth Amendment and therefore should be set aside,”said a press release from the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing Chavarria. 
At the Dec. 9 public forum in Washington, D.C. held by U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-CT, and U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, D-CA, Chavarria spoke about his experience being detained and what it means for his future.
“Since this incident, I do not feel free to travel. I am fearful that a visit to my mother could mean extended detention or a fabricated plot to destroy my life, like they threatened to do,” he testified. “If the goal is to make some citizens feel like they are of a second class, with only some of the rights but not others, then they have succeeded.”
Born in a refugee camp during the Nicaraguan Sandinista-Contra war, Chavarria detailed both the challenges he faced and the milestones he achieved – from being embarrassed for not having shoes in school as a young boy to graduating as a valedictorian at 15 and attending university in Managua on a full scholarship.
He then received scholarships to attend college in Canada and the United States, earned graduate degrees from the University of New Mexico and Harvard University before becoming a naturalized citizen in 2018, he said.
“When I held my U.S. passport for the first time, I felt an enormous sense of pride and I was deeply inspired to give my new country the best of me, my talent, my work and my dreams,” Chavarria said during his testimony, which was focused on the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
“My mother’s high expectations had propelled me to unlikely places, and I had to make a difference in the land that welcomed me,” he said in the Hart Senate Office building in D.C. 
On July 21, Chavarria was returning to Vermont through Texas after visiting his mother in Nicaragua. He was detained and questioned for hours, and federal immigration authorities at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston searched his possessions and confidential school district information.
It was a “surreal” and “dehumanizing” experience being separated from his spouse, with multiple federal officials aggressively questioning him in windowless rooms without clocks.
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt, introduced Winooski Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria at a the Dec. 9 forum in Washington D.C. Screenshot
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, who introduced Chavarria at the forum, commended the contributions of new Americans and condemned the “indiscriminate roundup of people.”
“Telling your story so that the American people can see that what we’re not talking about is an open border, what we’re not talking about is criminals who all of us want to be protected from,” he said. “We’re talking about hard working people who have families, who have careers, who have aspirations, and who deeply, deeply believe in the American dream.”
The forum included testimony from four other citizens who recounted similar detentions by federal immigration agents this year. 
DHS officials did not respond to comment specifically on Chavarria’s experience or lawsuit. They released an email stating that all travelers entering the United States are treated with “dignity and respect” and are subject to inspections “critical in identifying and combating serious crimes, such as terrorism, smuggling, human trafficking, child pornography, and visa fraud.” 
Chavarria’s testimony and lawsuit comes after the Winooski school district received an onslaught of racist and violent messages for raising the Somali flag after President Donald Trump called the country “garbage.”
The community in Winooski also recently rallied to help a second grade student and his mother, who were detained by immigration authorities during the Thanksgiving break.

Those who love life
Campbell Clarke, 16, Colchester
Life is 
meant to be lived 
fully and completely. 
You need to commit. 
Fully. 
You aren’t meant to dip one toe in from the edge. 
You’re meant to dive in 
with no hesitation, 
no “what ifs.” 
The people who do that 
are the ones who make every day 
thrilling. 
Who care so much 
and with their whole heart, 
care about life and those who live it,
that they are willing to 
risk that whole heart 
to make yours a little lighter. 
These are the people you can count on 
to send you a hug 
wrapped up in little glitters of their love 
anytime you need it. 
You might not even notice 
when they lift the weight, 
but the next time you turn inward to confront it,  
it will be missing. 
These are the people 
who together 
find a way to share their immense love for the world 
with everyone.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on Dec. 11, 2025.
For Rae Beecher, a South Burlington resident of six years, helping provide neighbors with access to food isn’t just a labor of love — it is an act of protest against the hunger war that millions of Americans fight every day.
Last Sunday from 1 p.m. until 2 p.m., for a third snowy week in a row, Beecher and a small group of volunteers were posted up on Market Street just in front of Goose Park with a table chock full of food, sanitary products, canned goods and winter clothes, waiting to greet any passersby with a smile and, should they need it, a hot bowl of soup, too. On the menu this week was a turkey broth vegetable soup with white rice and buttery roasted squash.
“My passion is cooking for people and not getting paid,” Beecher said, letting out a laugh.
The table sports a large “Food Not Bombs” banner, which is a national volunteer-run advocacy group that shares free meals — often vegan and vegetarian — made from reclaimed surplus food to protest war, poverty and environmental destruction.
And while the ethos of the new South Burlington initiative is similar, Beecher, who has organized the group, said it’s following more closely the Burlington-based mutual aid group, Food Not Cops, which has offered free food of all kinds and supplies in downtown Burlington every day for over four years.
“We believe that all food should be used,” Beecher said. “There is an ever-mounting pile of dairy products and meat and stuff that can be eaten.”
Beecher had been volunteering with the Food Not Cops group for three years, but before that had been on the receiving side of the table for a year. After seeing the impact the group was making, Beecher decided to become a part of it.
Part of the draw was the decentralized autonomy that exists with both Food Not Bombs and Food Not Cops, which makes volunteering an easy step to take without many rules or hoops to jump through.
“I myself am disabled, trans, all of these marginalized identities that have made it very difficult for me to be able to go places to volunteer,” Beecher said. “I’ve been all over the United States and it always seems like you have to be part of an organization or you’ve got to be a part of a church or you’ve got to fill out paperwork. But Food Not Bombs has made it so accessible to be able to volunteer.”
For Chamberlin neighborhood resident Ali Gitzes, that’s also part of the reason she has jumped on board after learning about the new initiative.
“I tried a couple of times to join some other Burlington groups, but I never really felt fully comfortable with some of the groups,” Gitzes said. “But here, it’s been very much a, ‘Hey, come and do what you are comfortable doing.’ And that has been fantastic for me.”
But bringing Food Not Bombs to South Burlington is personal for Beecher, who came to the city for one sole reason: safety. South Burlington continually floated to the top of the “best places to live” lists while researching places to relocate. After nearly 50 long hours of travel all those years ago, Beecher and Beecher’s child, Shelby, hopped off a bus in Vermont to begin a new life.
Although Beecher had been volunteering in Burlington for several years, bringing the program to South Burlington really began taking shape as Beecher noticed tents and small encampments popping up across the city.
“Before we moved here, we were homeless for two and a half years, going from shelter to shelter, so I recognized that struggle,” Beecher said. “I’ve been noticing folks sleeping on the ground on sheets on the concrete in my neighborhood. And I’ve got the knowledge, the skill set, all the connections that I needed to get this started in here.”
According to data from Hunger Free America, since the Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 54 million Americans, including 18 million children, are facing food insecurity. And more locally, a 2022 University of Vermont study showed that two in five people in Vermont had experienced food insecurity in 2021.
Despite the program’s success in feeding the community, the Food Not Cops initiative in Burlington faced public pushback in recent months when 100 business leaders drafted a letter in May, saying the program — and those utilizing the program — was having a “negative impact” on the area and should be moved out of its longtime home at the garage just off the Church Street Marketplace, according to reporting from Seven Days.
Although the South Burlington initiative is much smaller and still in its infancy, similar cries of concern have bled onto the city council table.
Councilor Laurie Smith brought up the topic at the end of a council meeting earlier this month, asking how the city plans to address some resident feedback, more specifically, what he’s heard about South Burlington, “becoming like Burlington” as safety concerns in City Center have mounted in recent months.
“What’s the concern?” City Manager Jessie Baker frankly asked.
“The concern is that we’re going to open up this food service and then we’re going to have this mass influx of unhealthy behavior,” Smith said, emphasizing that these weren’t his words but concerns he’s heard from constituents.
While the volunteer group is technically operating on city land without a permit, Baker said the city is taking a collaborative approach.
“We are taking the approach of, we would like to be in partnership with them and understand who they are and what their goals are and provide any support and partnership we can,” she said. “So that’s how our police chief and our community services sergeant are engaging.”
In the hour that the group was set up last week, at least four South Burlington residents dropped off donations. The overwhelming generosity from neighbors has far outweighed any pushback the group has received, which they noted has been minimal.
“There are a lot more people who want this community to be one that shows love,” volunteer Matt Van Wagner said. “And my feeling is that love begets love, and it drives out fear.”
After all, the initiative isn’t a charity or a service, Beecher said, its simply neighbors doing what they should for each other.
“It’s like a picnic out here, you know, trying to just help the community,” Beecher said. “Solidarity, not charity. We are out here for each other.”

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Dec. 11, 2025.
“I’m gonna die with a smile if it kills me,” Jon Gailmor sang on his 1990 song of the same name.
He sang it again in a video he released in April 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, in the midst of a project in which he posted a video of a performance each day of the lockdown, like bottled musical messages cast into the digital ocean, beginning with an original song about the virus on March 25, 2020, and ending with Steve Winwood’s “Back in the High Life Again” as the vaccines rolled out on May 9, 2021.
As a description for the video where he sang about planning to revel in the pleasures of life so deeply that he would embrace its end satisfied, he appended a note: “My philosophy of life since August 5, 1948.”
He sang his song about leaving this world with nothing left undone for the last time on Nov. 30 and died at 77 with a smile on his face in his son’s New Orleans home following a leukemia diagnosis 18 months prior.
Gailmor was born in Manhattan and spent his early childhood in Philadelphia at the dawn of postwar America. His father had come from a family of Orthodox rabbis, according to Westport reporter Dan Woog, but his father, William, left the synagogue to become a leftist journalist and eventual speechwriter for Henry Wallace, one-time vice president to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Progressive Party presidential candidate the year Gailmor was born, he told the Burlington Free Press in 1981. He was Wallace’s godson.
The future Vermont music icon graduated from Staples High School in Westford, Connecticut, in 1966, and his early adulthood was shaped by a turbulent world for someone born out of the hope that World War II would be the last war. He remarked to the Free Press that marching in the Poor People’s Campaign to Washington, D.C. in 1968, a protest for economic justice for the poor organized by Martin Luther King, Jr. prior to his assassination but carried out after it, was one of the “most beautiful days of (his) life.”

Despite the core of optimism that would become his hallmark as a professional musician, he grew increasingly pessimistic about the political state of the country as the sixties soured into the seventies. After vagabonding about Europe and releasing a little noticed folk record on British label Polydor with a former high school classmate, he decided trying to cut it in the commercial music industry was not for him. In the late 1970s, he drew closer to Vermont, settling on the shores of Lake Elmore.
“Vermont is what America could be and should be. Vermont is a country, a closely-knit country of its own. In many ways, Vermont feels like the ‘60s. There’s that ‘being a part of something’ and ‘having a say in something’ attitude here,” he said.
Vermont in turn embraced him and allowed his career as a children’s entertainer, teacher and troubadour to flourish. Gailmor planted his songs like little seeds, one by one, in classrooms and in parks and churches and village granges; in “Just Kidding,” the radio show for children on WDEV that ran for 25 years; in his popular songwriting workshops; and his general ability to break out a song wherever he went.
For nearly half a century, Gailmor planted his songs everywhere he went, whether it was a packed crowd in his hometown Elmore United Methodist Church or with the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, which he performed with in the summer of 1993 in a performance that prompted a Free Press writer to dub him “Vermont’s John Denver.”
“The guy could play anywhere, anytime and not miss a beat,” Rusty Dewees, fellow entertainer and Elmore resident, and friend of Gailmor’s, said. “He produced the same high-level output whether it was a dementia ward where everyone is sleeping, or a sold-out show with 10,000 people. You don’t see that with all entertainers. It’s unique.”
Though he wasn’t afraid to play broadly across genres, his workaday approach to songwriting, as something that could be born from anyone as long as it was a true feeling, feels directly descendent from the populist folk music tradition, not stadium pop country. Writer Tom Mckone quoted a friend in his remembrance of Gailmor in The Barre Montpelier Times Argus as calling him the “Pete Seeger of Vermont.” He was well on his way to gaining that status when he opened for Seeger and Arlo Guthrie at Sugarbush in 1978.
In an essay on the songwriting method he passed along to students of all ages published in 2006, Gailmor wrote that, in his misbegotten days trying to make it in the music business, he learned that trying to write a hit left him feeling empty, and that “honest writing unearths threads that connect us all, and that songs that were remembered came “from the gut.”
Despite his endless circuit of performing, teaching and raising his family with his wife, Cathy Murphy — she died in 2022 — Gailmor still devoted time to his role as town moderator, which he held through last year. Armed with Robert’s Rules of Order, he ran Town Meeting Day in Elmore for decades, facilitating the kind of community-centered political life that made him choose Vermont in the first place.
Gailmor would dote on Murphy whenever he got the opportunity, including in a 2022 interview with the News & Citizen about town moderators itching to get back to in-person town meetings. He said one of his favorite photos of his wife was from Town Meeting Day 1980, when she delivered “an eloquent presentation” about the importance of a nuclear arms freeze between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Of course, because this love for Town Meeting Day was a true feeling, Gailmor had to write a song about it. “A Town Meeting Tune,” from his 1994 album “Checking In,” is a paean to the annual enactment of small-scale democracy.
“Creating songs is exhilarating and fulfilling,” Gailmor wrote in 2006. “It also saves me an awful lot of money on therapy. As I age, my pieces become more personal and carry an urgency for me to launch them into the world while I’m still in it.”

	Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a “significant” factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt’s son signed in August 2024.
Yet Genesis hasn’t paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.
Once the nation’s largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.
The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.
When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.
As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.
“It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,” said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt’s family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.
Nellie Betancourt, shown in a photo with her husband, Gabe, had planned a trip to Las Vegas before she fractured her hip at a Genesis HealthCare rehabilitation center — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. “When she went into that place, I said, ‘Well, she’s going to be taken care of for a few more days and I’ll take her home,’” Gabe says.

Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained “focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption” during bankruptcy.
One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident’s behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer’s patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.
Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company’s owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis’ new ownership and other companies they blame for the company’s collapse.
John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, “They never had any intention to honor these deals.”
Low ratings and fines
During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.
In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.
In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.

The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.
Dangers in memory care
Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.
Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer’s in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded “shut up bitch I know you like this,” according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.
Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident’s behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, “I want to have sex with you.” When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, “Shhh.”
The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. “don’t sing anymore.”
Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn’t provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.’ lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“We just felt we have to hold them accountable,” R.S.’ daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. “Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?”
Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family’s claim filing.

Growth and debt
Genesis’ downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.
In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis’ bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.
Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis’ bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and “mired in corporate inefficiencies.” Robichaux wrote that Genesis’ financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the covid pandemic.
Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux’s filing.
But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised “substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee’s Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and “siphon value to himself.” The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while “staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.” Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.
Drawn-out lawsuits
Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson’s lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.
After the judge rejected Genesis’ request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2½ years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.
This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“It was so drawn out and for so long,” Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis’ bankruptcy “despicable.”
Payouts postponed
Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson’s, said the company frequently filed appeals. “They did not usually win them on these issues,” she said, “and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.”
Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote’s law partner. “The payments wouldn’t start for several months out,” Harvey said. Foote said Genesis’ lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.
Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis’ settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.
Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy — 21 months after the case was resolved — it still owed $100,000, according to the family’s claim.
‘We never found out the truth’
Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.
“It looked like she was hit by a truck,” Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. “I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.”
The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson’s jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.
“We never found out the truth,” Harley said. “They wanted to settle out of court.”
The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson’s five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.
“If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,” Harley said.
Maddening judges
By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.
Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate’s lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown’s estate or explain the delay.
Genesis “obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,” McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. “They assure me that they’re not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven’t lived up to what the bargain was.”
Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.
In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.
In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing “unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.” Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.
Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt’s claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt’s lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.
Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.
‘Bankruptcy as a tool’
In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.
Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.
“Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,” Rafatjoo said. “A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.”
On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau’s favor despite an “objectively better and higher competing bid” from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau’s group had increased its bid during the auction.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee’s Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that “individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.” Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.
Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.
“They can file bankruptcy again,” said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. “And we’re the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.”

Many parents want to keep it that way,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/14/ct-doesnt-regulate-homeschooling-many-parents-want-to-keep-it-that-way/,Seeing their kids fall behind during COVID galvanized a new cohort of parents to educate their children themselves. They’re sticking with it.,"It was March of 2022 when Alicia Teitelbaum, a Stamford mother of three, made her decision. 
Her second-grader Britney, who had a speech delay, had spent two years surrounded by people wearing masks. Evelyn, her fourth-grade daughter, was still struggling to catch up after missing many weeks of school in 2020 with exhaustion brought on by Lyme disease.
“I was literally pulling out chunks of my hair,” Evelyn, now 13, recalled. “It was definitely not a healthy environment with me.” 
Teitelbaum said she’d tried to be involved at her children’s school. She was a member of the Parent Teacher Association, worked on a community garden project and developed a food-saving program. But she said she felt the school didn’t want parents’ input. 
Teitelbaum’s youngest daughter was set to start kindergarten the next school year, but a recently-passed state law meant the family would no longer qualify for vaccine exemptions — which Teitelbaum wanted because of concerns about health conditions in the family. 
She decided that, starting the following year, her three daughters would receive their education at home. 
Teitelbaum was part of a wave of parents across the country who moved away from traditional school systems after the pandemic hit. The experience of watching children struggle to sit in front of screens and fall farther behind in their learning galvanized a new cohort of parents to take on the task of educating their children themselves. 
With schools now back to pre-pandemic, in-person, maskless learning, many of those new homeschool parents have decided to stick with it. 
It’s difficult to get solid estimates of the number of homeschoolers in the country — particularly in Connecticut, where parents aren’t required to inform their local district that they’re homeschooling. 
The U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey found that about 5.9% of children in the U.S. were reported as being homeschooled in the 2023-24 school year. The survey also found Connecticut had one of the lowest proportions of homeschoolers that year, at about 3% of the total student population. According to state data from 2023-24, just over 1,800 children were reported as being homeschooled. 
National figures show that the rise in homeschooling was widespread that year. The Institute for Educational Policy at Johns Hopkins University found that 19 of 21 states that reported data on homeschooling showed a higher number of children in homeschool in 2023-24 compared to the prior year. (Connecticut wasn’t among the states included in the study.) 
Connecticut families who are part of the recent wave of new homeschoolers said the benefits quickly became clear. 
They said homeschooling brought their families closer, with siblings learning side-by-side and parents and children spending their days together. It gave children more freedom to explore their own interests and learn at their own pace. Parents of children with learning disabilities say by teaching them at home, they’re more able to provide the attention and services their children need — which they often don’t receive in school.
Many parents believed they’d found the answer. But then, more questions came.

Earlier this year, homeschooling came under scrutiny from state lawmakers after multiple high-profile cases of child abuse made national news. In May, the public learned of a Waterbury man who was allegedly held captive for two decades after being withdrawn from public school. 
The state Office of the Child Advocate released a report that found withdrawals of children from public schools had been used to hide abuse. Of 774 children who were withdrawn to be homeschooled between 2021 and 2024, about a quarter were in families where there had been at least one report of abuse or neglect that the Department of Children and Families judged to merit more attention. (The state doesn’t keep equivalent data on the families of children who attend public schools.)
Alongside the report, Acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio drafted recommendations that the state require homeschool parents to inform their local school districts each year that they’re homeschooling, and that their children receive an annual academic evaluation. She also recommended that local school districts review the records of any family seeking to withdraw a child for homeschooling, to see whether there are any past reports of abuse and neglect. 
Ghio said the recommendations were based on two goals: to make sure homeschooled children are being educated and to keep them “healthy and safe.” 
“ We acknowledge there are a lot of parents that are doing homeschooling and doing a wonderful job, and this is not an allocation of blame on those parents,” she said. “The reality, though, is we currently have a system where we know that some children are being removed from school for the stated purpose of homeschooling to hide abuse and neglect. And that’s not acceptable.” 
The assurances have done little to calm the fears of parents like Teitelbaum. 
Many homeschooling parents — who have devoted resources, time and money to giving their children what they feel is the best education possible — say they feel they’re being blamed for the state’s shortcomings. They point to failures by the state Department of Children and Families to monitor families who were reported for neglect and abuse before they pulled their children from the public schools — families like that of 11-year-old Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García, who was abused and died in 2024 and whose mother allegedly claimed the child was being homeschooled in another state. 
Rather than regulating homeschooling, parents like Teitelbaum say they want the state to audit DCF and address problems in its operations.
“I don’t understand why the legislative body is protecting DCF as a government agency instead of saying, ‘We have major failures going on, let’s fix them,’” Teitelbaum said.
DCF spokesperson Peter Yazbak said in a statement that the agency is “committed to being as transparent as possible and welcome further dialogue and feedback from families, legislators, advocates and community partners to enhance our case practice and best protect children.”
Parents and advocates also frequently mention the challenges faced by the public schools — chronic absenteeism, for example, or the number of students in public schools who aren’t reading or doing math at grade level. They say the state should be focusing on what’s already under its control.
“Fix your house that’s broken rather than trying to regulate what we’re doing,” Teitelbaum said.

The Evergreen Co-op Social Club
One might assume all homeschool arrangements look similar: a group of siblings scribbling in workbooks around a dining room table. But these days the educational experience is more varied, and more communal. 
Take, for example, the co-op — a collective of parents who teach classes to their own children and other children in the group. Three years ago, Teitelbaum founded her own co-op along with nine other families in Stamford. 
With the blessing of her pastor at the Church of Christ in Stamford, they transformed the building into the home of the Evergreen Co-op Social Club, which meets on Mondays and Thursdays and offers a mix of classes that they switch up every 10 weeks. Most of the co-op parents spent the other three days of the week covering more academic subjects like math and language arts at home.
On an October morning inside the church, children as young as toddlers all the way through high school were scattered in classrooms, or sitting outside in the sunshine for their classes. No space was left unused. Jackets, bookbags and shoes lined the hallway from the main worship space to classroom and fellowship areas. 
Downstairs, a parish social space filled with tables and chairs served as a cafeteria during lunchtime and a space for art and cooking classes during the day. Amy Irish, a mom of two, was downstairs checking on the earrings that her students had fashioned out of clay, part of a jewelry-making class she teaches. 
The classes range from three to 12 students who are roughly the same age. All are taught by parents, who offer instruction in subjects aligned with their expertise or interests. Irish, a former yoga teacher, also teaches a section on hula-hooping. John Questel, a father of three who worked as an electrician in the U.S. Navy, said he sometimes teaches an introductory class on circuits. 
Like the other parents, Irish and Questel said it was the pandemic that pushed them to homeschool. Irish, who at the time had a second-grader and a toddler, said it was impossible to get her second-grader to sit in front of a screen while responding to her toddler’s demands for attention. 
“Remote hybrid learning was so terrible,” Questel said. Even before that, his son Steven didn’t like school. The boy had trouble reading, and while the public school gave him extra help, as soon as he’d get caught up, all the extra help would disappear, Questel said. And his son would fall behind once again.

Homeschooling was his wife’s idea, and initially he wasn’t thrilled, Questel said. He’d grown up in public school, and his perception of homeschoolers was that they were antisocial and didn’t have the necessary skills to succeed in life. But discovering the existence of co-ops, coupled with the fact that his wife had a master’s degree in education, convinced him to give it a shot. 
Several of the homeschool parents have backgrounds in education. Brittany Velazquez, who drives to the co-op from her home just over the state line in New York, was a former teacher and assistant principal in the New York City Public Schools. Her oldest son, Amari, was only a baby when COVID began, but her experiences working in the school system during the pandemic made her realize that she wanted to take charge of her son’s education herself. 
“ I can give him a more well-rounded education because I know what he’s into,” she explained. “One-to-one learning would be the ideal situation for anybody. So I kind of just took it and then ran with it at that time.” 
Some of the parents who send their children to Evergreen have exceptional skills they teach the children. For instance, Teitelbaum said one of their parents who worked on Broadway has taught a music class. At picnic tables outside the church, a parent who works at the Greenwich Country Day School was teaching carpentry, demonstrating how to use a drill and explaining different drill bits. In a “Model UN” class — in which students pick a country to represent and learn about the United Nations — one of the guest speakers was a mother who’d worked as a translator during the Kosovo War.  
Angela Watson, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and the director of the university’s Homeschool Research Lab, said the availability of groups like co-ops, along with a vast array of online resources and materials, should alleviate concerns that parents might not have enough education themselves in order to teach their children. Several of the parents said they also have tutors who work with their children on days they aren’t at the co-op. 
Erin Reeves, a former hairstylist, said she’s taught a few courses on the subject, including a color and styling class that ended with the kids having their hair dyed. Reeves said she initially said no to teaching at the co-op. “ The idea of teaching other kids was overwhelming to me,” Reeves said. “I was like, I feel like I’m barely teaching mine.” 
That has changed. This semester, Reeves and a group of 11-year-olds are reading “Bridge to Terabithia,” a short novel about two friends who create an imaginary kingdom. The kids are creating costumes and props for their own “kingdom” — an undersea one. 
Teitelbaum’s daughter Britney was dressed in a mermaid costume, wearing a crown she made from construction paper and carrying a trident made out of aluminum foil. At the end of the class, they’d perform a play.

Reeves discovered the co-op through Teitelbaum after she’d decided to pull her daughters from school during the pandemic. Her oldest, Violet, who was in second grade when the pandemic hit, has dyslexia and ADHD, which made online schooling nearly impossible for her. 
“I couldn’t even unload my dishwasher,” Reeves said. “They both just needed help constantly.” 
Violet, who is now 13, said she remembers struggling in elementary school and that she was bullied because of her dyslexia. She said her parents had to bribe her with money and candy to get her to go to school. 
Reeves said she was nervous at first about the idea of homeschooling a child with a reading disability. She did a lot of research on her own and hired a tutor specializing in dyslexia. Then they discovered the co-op, which she said both her daughters loved. 
In some ways the co-op feels like a series of after-school clubs and activities, designed to bring students together and expand their interests and knowledge. 
The co-op breaks down what parents say is one of the major misconceptions about homeschooling: that the children are isolated and have no social life.
In addition to participating in co-ops, homeschool students often enroll in sports. Some of the students participate in Barefoot University, a weekly group that offers activities focused on nature and the outdoors. Teitelbaum’s daughters are part of a writing group that meets online with a former writing teacher who offers coaching. Questel’s 15-year-old son Steven is enrolled in online college courses. 
“ My kids are so social, and they just have so many interesting experiences all around,” said Irish. 
Teitelbaum repeatedly refers to the co-op as having the “village mentality.” It’s a place where the families know one another and are invested in one another’s lives, she said. 
“They’re all my kids,” she said.

What’s best for kids
Homeschool organizations have a history of success — in many states — in pressuring lawmakers to recognize homeschooling as a legitimate form of education, and then to loosen restrictions on it. 
In the book “Homeschool: An American History,” Milton Gaither wrote that state lawmakers who try to strengthen regulations on homeschooling almost always fail “due to massive outcry from homeschoolers.” Gaither even cited an example from Connecticut, when, in 2002, a state representative proposed legislation requiring local superintendents to approve homeschoolers’ curriculum and mandating that parents who homeschool have at least a high school diploma. Over 1,000 people showed up in opposition to the bill, which never saw the light of day. 
Something similar happened this year. In May, as lawmakers conducted a hearing on the child advocate’s report and recommendations, thousands of homeschool families crowded into the Legislative Office Building in Hartford to protest the possibility of new regulations. They stayed on for several days, many of them with children in tow, displaying signs throughout the building’s lobby and atrium. 
Ultimately, lawmakers decided not to raise any new legislation establishing new requirements for homeschoolers.  
Unlike some of its neighboring states, Connecticut doesn’t require homeschoolers to submit an instructional plan or submit the results of a yearly academic test. It’s one of 12 states that doesn’t even require homeschoolers to notify local districts that they plan to homeschool. 
Ghio, Connecticut’s acting child advocate, said her recommendations for homeschooling were meant to strike a balance between parents’ rights to teach and care for their children as they deem fit and children’s rights to be educated and well-cared for. 
Watson, at Johns Hopkins, said she believes that for a state like Connecticut, with no regulations around homeschooling, to add in stringent requirements would be extremely difficult. Instead, she suggested the state use incentives for homeschoolers to participate more in the wider public school community — like offering free testing or free curriculum, or allowing homeschoolers to participate in sports and extracurriculars in their local school districts. 
“Connecticut is one of the only states in the country that doesn’t provide for any access at all for homeschooled children to their local public schools,” Watson said. 
Fran Rabinowitz, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Public School Superintendents, said allowing that kind of participation in public school activities could be complicated, raising questions about insurance and how to handle situations in which a child gets hurt or refuses to follow rules. 
And Ghio said the incentives Watson suggested wouldn’t resolve the problem of parents who withdraw children from school in order to isolate them from society.

Coral Karrass, a mother of three who serves as treasurer of the Connecticut Homeschool Network, one of the largest homeschool organizations in the state, said she felt recent conversations at the Capitol were creating a picture of homeschooling families as “secretive abusers.” 
“ It’s hurtful. It’s so hurtful,” she said. 
She said she often speaks with parents who tell her about the difficulties they’d had with their local public school. She said while public schools are necessary, they aren’t the ideal place for all students. 
“We care about kids,” she said. “I think that everyone should want to see what is best for every child, no matter what that might be, no matter what that looks like.” 
Karrass was homeschooling before the pandemic. She and her sister taught their combined five children together. They switched back-and-forth between their two homes, carrying a bag that contained notes from whoever had taught the previous day. 
She and her sister both needed to work — they work gig jobs making deliveries — and the arrangement allowed them to educate their kids while earning money. 
Her niece and daughter were close in age, as were her nephew and her son, meaning they could do similar assignments. Karrass said she established a tiered system, where each child would do assignments on a similar theme, but at their own level. 
She described it as resembling a one-room schoolhouse. The older children care for the younger ones, she said, and it’s a better example of the kind of relationships they would encounter as adults. 
“I think when you go out into the real world, even in college … you’re mixed with a wider variety of people,” Karrass said. “It’s more like a realistic community than I think what a public or private school setting gives.” 
Karrass hadn’t expected to homeschool. Her oldest daughter, Abbi, was a January baby, and she barely missed the cutoff date to enroll in kindergarten. The little girl seemed ready to start learning, so Karrass decided she’d try teaching her for a year. By the end of that year, Abbi was reading at an advanced level. 
Rather than put her in a classroom where she would be far ahead of her peers, Karrass said, she decided to continue homeschooling her. When Karrass’s sister saw what she was doing, she wanted to join in. 
Through an online chat group, Karrass connected with Diane Connors, president and co-founder of CHN, who she said helped guide her through the homeschool process. She said the organization provides parents with critical support in everything from finding curriculum to establishing a routine. 
Karrass also developed a list of free and inexpensive resources for parents who don’t have a lot of money to spend on homeschooling. “Money should not be an obstacle,” Karrass said. “If you have access to the internet, ignorance is a choice.” 
Research from Johns Hopkins shows that parents of gifted students, like Karrass, often turn to homeschooling when the local school district can’t meet their needs. 
The same is true of children with special needs. Watson said that “upwards of 20% to 30%” of homeschoolers fit that description. 
That was the case for Kathryn, a single mother of two boys who pulled her younger son out to homeschool during the 2021-22 school year. Kathryn asked that only her middle name be used because her older son is still receiving special education services through their local school district, and she’s concerned about repercussions. 
Kathryn’s sons are both on the autism spectrum, she said, and getting special education services for her older son was a “full legal battle.” He was being restrained and secluded on a near-weekly basis — so much that he developed claustrophobia. Eventually, her local district placed him in a specialized school outside the district. 
Her younger son’s challenges started in first grade. She said she couldn’t get his school to provide him with a special education plan, called an IEP, and he was being bullied. By Christmas of that year, Kathryn said, he was trying to figure out how to avoid going to school.
But it wasn’t long before the pandemic hit, and Kathryn began working from home more. That allowed her the time to homeschool her younger son. 
She now works a hybrid schedule. On the days she’s home, she gives her son assignments he can do independently. The teaching continues year-round, including on evenings and weekends. On the days Kathryn goes to the office, a nanny stays with her son, who is now 10 years old. He’s also part of a co-op, and plays adaptive sports. 
Kathryn said she’s concerned with the idea of additional regulations for homeschoolers. The idea of being forced to check in with the school district annually makes no sense, she said. “They already failed my child once. Why would they step in again?”

Tradeoffs and priorities
Parents who choose to homeschool don’t do so lightly. It requires a great deal of time and engagement, Watson said. But they say the rewards — family time, a flexible way of learning — outweigh whatever sacrifices they’ve made.
“ I don’t homeschool because I think traditional public or private school education is bad,” said Trisha Kozloski, who directs the Catholic Schoolhouse Co-op in Middletown. “I do it because these children were given to me as wonderful gifts from God, and I want to be with them as much as I can. And we have a big family, and so I want us to know each other and love each other and build relationships and strong bonds.” 
Parents emphasized the benefits of spending time together as a family, the flexibility of allowing children to learn at their own pace, and the absence of stigma for children with disabilities. They say their children can sleep in; that they can finish their schoolwork in a few hours, leaving time for fun excursions, and that they no longer have to rush through the mornings. For children who are deeply involved in outside activities, like dance, it allows them to focus on their passions without the pressure of a traditional schedule. 
That doesn’t mean it comes without challenges. With the need for one parent to be present at home, choosing to homeschool sometimes means moving to a single income, forcing the family to be more frugal.
“ Of course I would love a bigger house,” Kozloski said. “ You make these choices. And my kids are also just fine with not having these things. They don’t get everything they want. They wear hand-me-down clothes. And they’re perfectly fine children. They’re probably better for that, too.” 
For some parents, it also means making the hard decision to give up a career they’ve worked toward. 
“I think as a female it is very hard to say you spent five years working at a degree for something, and then say, well, my priorities have shifted,” said Teitelbaum, who worked as a physical therapist before deciding to homeschool full-time. 
Velazquez, who had worked in the New York City public schools, said the decision was also difficult for her at first. “ I was really sad for a long time. At one point, I kind of felt like it was a defeat,” she said. “And then one day it really just clicked that … you have all of this value to give your most prized possession, which is your child.”  
Kozloski said she was disturbed by the idea that a child was being abused by parents who lied and said they were homeschooling. But she said that those bad actions didn’t negate her good ones. “ I have nothing to hide, but that doesn’t mean you should make me prove myself. I’m doing what I’m supposed to be doing,” she said. 
Kozloski said she’s worried that additional regulations would take away from the time she has to spend teaching her kids.
“ My main focus is educating these kids and doing that to the best of my ability. I don’t want to be burdened by recordkeeping,” said Kozloski. 
And Karrass expressed concern that the public schools, which have graduated children who were unable to read, would be responsible for determining what was or wasn’t “adequate” for homeschoolers — potentially holding them to a different standard. 
Watson, of Johns Hopkins, said evidence shows that homeschooled children often do well on tests and attend college. And while her research showed that homeschooling families value academic achievement, they place less value on having their children attend prestigious universities. Parents who spoke to the Connecticut Mirror also placed a great deal of value on practical, everyday knowledge. 
Karrass said it was more important to her that her children have a solid foundation rather than be pushed ahead to advanced classes. A student might be able to figure out a calculus equation but can’t add simple money, a task they would need to do every day, she said. 
“Academics are great. Of course, everyone wants their kids to be straight-A students and get lots of scholarship money for college and get all the AP credits and stuff,” Kozloski said. “But I want my kids to be kind, contributing members of society in whatever way fits for them.” 
Similarly, Teitelbaum said her priorities aren’t about having her children work at a Fortune 500 company or go to an Ivy League university. 
“I want them to be happy. I want them to be great people,” she said.

Two homeschoolers, two stories
In the homeschool community, advocates refer regularly to a specific passage in Connecticut state law known as Section 10-184 — “Duties of Parents.” 
It’s a law that requires parents to teach their children basic subjects, including history, mathematics, reading and writing, either by sending them to a public school or proving they are getting “equivalent instruction” somewhere else. Homeschool advocates present this law as proof that the state places the education and care of children first and foremost in the hands of the adults who raise them. 
In this lies one of the biggest challenges in proposing homeschool regulations: the vast diversity in how parents teach their children and the wide spectrum of experiences that former homeschoolers say have influenced their lives, for better or worse. 
Some young adults say homeschooling was the best education they could have imagined. 
“I couldn’t have asked for a better education, for a better childhood,” said 21-year-old Annaliese Harper, a former homeschooler, during a forum in August in Torrington. 
The youngest of five, Harper — whose mother is Donna Person, vice president of the Education Association of Christian Homeschoolers in Connecticut — was homeschooled from an early age all the way through high school. Most days, she said, she would finish her work by 1 or 2 p.m. and have free time for other activities. She was involved in dance, drama, took piano lessons and showed Alpacas and goats while in 4-H.

Up until high school, Harper was part of a once-a-week co-op through Classical Conversations, a Christian homeschool education program that has chapters across the country and internationally. Harper said homeschoolers would be grouped by age and study traditional subjects like math, science, history, English and Latin. The program was primarily discussion-based, with parents acting as “tutors” to help students learn. 
Harper said she never felt she was missing out on anything by not attending a traditional school. 
“I was thankful I didn’t have to wake up at, I don’t know, 7 a.m. and go to school and I didn’t have to be in a classroom all day. I could go outside a lot and be with my family, be with my siblings,” she said. 
Her experience was different from that of 24-year-old Beau Triba, who was also homeschooled throughout his life. Triba spoke at a forum on homeschooling in May, where he said his parents were part of an evangelical Christian community that had to approve all the textbooks he used and controlled myriad aspects of his life — from what he wore to whom he could be friends with. He said he did not receive instruction and taught himself by reading the textbooks his mother gave him.
“I think that my mom did the best that she could. I want to say that with my full heart,” Triba told CT Mirror. “She did not have the resources she needed to educate three young children.” 
Triba, who is queer and transgender, said he struggled with anxiety and depression from a young age, made worse by the isolation he felt. He also said he felt judged by the community he was raised in. 
Triba said in May that he did not feel that the education he received was equal to a public school education, that it contained inaccurate information, and that it did not prepare him for adulthood. 
“I have never felt more alone than I did while being homeschooled. I did not feel supported,” Triba said. 
Triba also participated in Classical Conversations, although he didn’t start the program until high school. He didn’t have a strong foundation in basic subjects, he said, and he struggled to understand the lessons. Rather than receiving additional help, Triba left a lot of the work undone, and he said his transcript falsely indicated he’d completed coursework he hadn’t. 
Harper said she was able to take college-level classes in English and chemistry at the age of 16. She said that, because of her education, the English class was a review for her. She said she was well-prepared for the college environment — able to advocate for herself and interact with professors.
She is now a senior at Eastern Connecticut State University, studying social work. After graduating, she plans to enroll in a masters program. She got married in May, and she said she hopes to start her own family — and plans to homeschool her children. Her experiences with social work, she said, have shown her the challenges inherent in keeping children safe in a child-welfare system that she described as “overrun.” 
“I see how hard public school teachers work, how hard social workers work, but the truth is no teacher, no social worker — [no one] can know your child as well as you do and can give the most focus as a parent can,” she said. 
In contrast, Triba said he struggled through two semesters of community college. He didn’t know how to read a syllabus, how to manage his time, or who to go to for help. He attempted suicide and ended up in a hospital and then in various intensive therapeutic programs. Eventually, he took a course through Hartford HealthCare to become a recovery support specialist, a job he said he enjoys.  
Triba said he supports the idea of having homeschoolers regularly check in with officials — not as a punitive measure, but as a way to offer help to homeschooling families like his. 
“I think there were so many resources that could have been offered that just weren’t, because nobody knew we were struggling,” Triba told CT Mirror. 
In particular, Triba said, it would have been helpful to have support from social services after his first suicide attempt at age 16. He said he was not hospitalized and received no professional counseling in the aftermath. 
Through the Coalition for Responsible Home Education, a nationwide nonprofit that advocates for legislation regulating homeschooling, Triba met other homeschoolers who also had negative experiences.
He said it’s sometimes hard to talk about his own history, because he doesn’t want to interfere with those homeschoolers who are going above or beyond. He said any regulations should be made in collaboration with the whole community and should emphasize offering resources rather than investigating wrongdoing. 
“I think there’s a middle ground here that we can find,” he said. “And we have to — I think we have to find this middle ground.”

A call for ‘genuine conversation’ on policy 
Not all parents who homeschool are against the recommendations Ghio raised. 
Steve Kennedy, a Newtown resident who homeschools his four children, said he supports proposals like annual check-ins and academic assessments for homeschoolers. 
Kennedy said he decided to homeschool because he wanted to give his children a more in-depth curriculum than he felt they would receive in the public schools, particularly in the area of history. He said although he reads the state standards and has given his oldest daughter standardized assessments to make sure she’s on track, he would “welcome some feedback” from the state or local districts.  
“I think the whole idea of parental rights, it kind of blanks out the child’s [rights] entirely,” said Kennedy. “It’s framed as … ‘Oh, this is the government coming in and telling you what to do,’ when really it’s like, ‘The government is making sure that children’s rights are maintained.’”  
Kennedy said he didn’t believe the state was trying to force homeschoolers to enroll their children in public schools, and he said he didn’t see the policies as “particularly burdensome or intrusive.” 
Rabinowitz, of the superintendents association, said she envisioned a state-run and state-funded office for homeschoolers, rather than expecting them to report to their local school districts. The office would oversee regulations, she said, but also provide support for homeschooling families.
“I personally know some homeschoolers, and I’ve heard some wonderful things about homeschooling, and I think we can learn from them as well,” Rabinowitz said. “My outlook isn’t one of anything negative about homeschooling other than we need to account for all our children.” 
State Rep. Patrick Biggins, D-Manchester, who served as the chair of a legislative working group on homeschooling, said conversations with constituents and research into best practices for regulating homeschooling were ongoing.
“I think that the goal is to balance parents’ rights with the state’s vested interest in making sure children are safe, and making sure children are getting an education,” Biggins said, adding that he doesn’t believe the current law emphasizes those values strongly enough.
“Conversations are still preliminary,” State Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, the chair of the Education Committee, said in a text message. 
State Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, the highest ranking Republican on the legislature’s Education Committee, said she also wasn’t aware of any proposed bill. She said that while she felt it was critical to protect children’s safety, she did not support singling out homeschoolers. Any changes lawmakers make, she said, should consider challenges in the public schools as well. 
Chemay Morales-James, who has homeschooled her children for about a decade, said she understands the desire that public school and state officials have to try to keep children safe, even as she doubts that the regulations being proposed will help children who find themselves in the most dangerous situations.   
Morales-James, a former teacher, now runs a homeschool collective called My Reflection Matters. The majority of families in it are people of color who often came to homeschooling after dealing with specific challenges in the public schools. Morales-James said families in her collective often distrust the public school system because of its historic failure to serve communities of color. 
She said her oldest son, who is Black, spent just three days in pre-K before she decided to pull him out. He was acting out, and she worried how teachers would perceive him as he got older.
She said she knew families whose children had been placed in special education in response to what she characterized as “overactive energy.” And she said the schools sometimes failed to address what she described as “racial incidents” that would happen between students or between a student and a teacher. She also said families felt their culture and history weren’t always portrayed correctly in public school curricula. 
“Racism is a health crisis to many of our families,” she said, referring to the collective. “It affects people mentally and emotionally and they don’t believe that schools take that seriously enough … so they just choose to opt out.” 
Morales-James homeschools her two boys, now ages 14 and 12, through a philosophy called “unschooling” — allowing their interests to guide what they study and learn. She said it removes a lot of the pressure that comes from a traditional education system. 
She said that as a former teacher, she’d watched how students who didn’t learn according to a school system’s expectations would be “labeled” and feel as though they weren’t as smart as other children. She said that homeschooling allowed her own boys to learn free from the comparison with other children. 
That’s one of the reasons she’s concerned about the idea of regulations around homeschooling.
“Are you going to say I’m abusive because my 8-year-old didn’t reach your standard?” she said. “It’s such a tricky, fine thing because the whole reason we’re opting out is because many of us don’t believe in those standards. So then to hold us up against them, it’s like, well then, where’s our freedom?”  
Morales-James said if Connecticut wants to implement regulations that would actually protect children, she believes there would need to be more dialogue between the public schools and the homeschooling community. She said she’s tired of the polarization that has thwarted sincere discussion. 
“I think the options they’re giving out now — they won’t work because they have not come out of real, genuine conversations between these two groups. And until those conversations and real working happens in relationship with each other, we’re going to keep producing or promoting policy that is not going to work for either.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1113_SR_Homeschool_353-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-14 05:56:15.721665

While it’s not actually mandatory to offer as a benefit, it’s at the top of the list for many employees and job seekers—making it feel mandatory for nonprofits that are looking to attract and retain quality employees. However, for many Connecticut business owners, the ever-rising costs associated with traditional group health plans make offering health insurance to employees feel almost impossible, and certainly outside of the budget.
Today, Connecticut business owners have another option. An option that can help you manage employee health benefits more efficiently and find quality, affordable health coverage with the BusinessPlus platform. BusinessPlus simplifies the process of managing health benefits and provides access to additional coverage options like Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements (ICHRA), making it easier to find and offer flexible coverage that won’t stretch your budget.
The BusinessPlus platform, together with ICHRA, gives Connecticut businesses an opportunity to affordably provide quality health coverage to their employees. Some Connecticut business owners have received quotes that outline double-digit savings if they were to switch from their traditional group health plan to an ICHRA.* With the cost of traditional group health plans today, double-digit savings can be a significant increase to your bottom line.
The benefits of offering an ICHRA don’t stop at the savings though. ICHRA also provides employees with more flexibility and choice compared to traditional group plans. With an ICHRA, employees have the opportunity to purchase their own individual health plans, rather than being forced into a one-size-fits-all group plan. With an ICHRA there are 22 individual plan options for employees to choose from that range in coverage and cost, ensuring there is a plan that can meet the unique needs of employees and their families.
And sure, having the ability to choose from 22 plan options is an excellent benefit, but to some it might feel overwhelming or create a paralysis of choice. At Access Health CT, we understand this may be a concern. To help anyone who may feel overwhelmed by the process, Connecticut-certified brokers are eagerly waiting to support your transition to an ICHRA, answer your questions, or help whenever you may need it at any point in the process. So, between the ease and simplicity of managing employee health benefits that are baked into the BusinessPlus platform, and the support from Connecticut-certified brokers, the entire process from start to finish is designed to be as easy as we could make it for Connecticut business owners.
While employees get to choose their own individual health plans, the cost and budget for reimbursement are left up to the business owners. This helps ensure that offering an ICHRA is always within your budget.
Together, the BusinessPlus platform and ICHRA provide Connecticut business owners with an alternative to the rising costs of traditional group health plans, while giving employees the freedom to choose a plan that best suits them and their health needs.

(White House)If you were appalled by the spectacle of Donald Trump clumsily accepting a peace trophy that looks like a prop from “Night of the Living Dead,” then brace yourself.
There may be worse in store.
To recount, Trump was given — to nobody’s surprise — the inaugural “FIFA Peace Prize” during the World Cup final draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington. You may recall that Trump named himself chair and master of ceremonies at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which for 50 years had been the nation’s premier cultural institution and largely insulated from politics. Now, it’s simply another reflection of Trump’s MAGA whims, and an oddly political choice for the final draw.
I don’t follow soccer — sorry, I mean football — but I gather from those who do that the final draw is an important day for fans, because that’s when they know which teams will play at various host cities.
Next year’s World Cup — which has been touted as the equivalent of 104 Super Bowls — is expected to be the biggest sporting event on the planet. The games will be held at 16 locations in the United States, Mexico, and Canada — including Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.
The first game at Arrowhead will be Argentina (the 2022 Cup champion) versus Algeria on June 16.
But any news about the matchups was overshadowed by Trump’s clutching of the prize (or rather, the medal that came with) from FIFA president Gianni Infantino. FIFA is the global governing body for the sport and it has a history of bad behavior. The 2022 Cup was embroiled in bribery claims and concern about human rights violations in the host country, Qatar. In 2015, following an FBI investigation, top FIFA officials were indicted for racketeering and money laundering. You can think of Infantino giving Trump the prize as akin to the world’s most historically corrupt sports body giving a trophy to one of the world’s most corrupt leaders.
Trump, smarting from not having received the Nobel Peace Prize he so lusted after, accepted the FIFA prize but couldn’t resist taking a swipe at the Biden administration.
“The United States one year ago was not doing too well,” he said.
The prize, according to FIFA, is given “to reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace and by doing so have united people across the world.”
FIFA did not reveal whether there were other nominees for the award or why the prize was announced just a month before. Apparently, the extrajudicial killings of alleged drug traffickers in small boats, the demonization and mass deportation of migrants at home, or threatening to invade Venezuela were not disqualifying factors.
The trophy, reputedly made of real gold, matched the absurdity of the award itself. It is a dread object, with zombie-like hands clawing upward, as if from the grave, at a globe that resembles a meatball you left in the microwave too long. But at least it was on brand. His mooning over the FIFA prize reminded me of the 2017 photo of Trump with his hands on a glowing orb in Saudi Arabia. No James Bond movie villain could signal his desire for world domination any clearer.
Why on this or any other Earth would FIFA indulge Trump?
To keep him happy.
Trump, a dangerous combination of ego and avarice, is about the only person who could seriously disrupt the World Cup games. Of the three host countries, the United States has the most locations, 11, and Trump has demonstrated his willingness to send troops to American cities for any reason. Also, most of the 6.5 million fans expected to attend this summer’s games are from places that Trump may have taken a dislike to, including Africa and South America. At least one national team — Haiti — is from a place Trump has described as a “s***hole” country.
Travel bans could seriously disrupt the ability of fans to attend games, and without fans there is no fan money. While claims that the World Cup is equivalent to 104 Super Bowls are likely overblown, there is no denying that a staggering amount of money is at stake. Tickets for the 2026 games are the most expensive in the World Cup’s history. Admission for the best matches range into the thousands of dollars and “dynamic pricing” — a first for FIFA — will set prices for some games according to demand.
The six games to be played at Arrowhead, including one quarter-final game, are expected to attract 650,000 visitors to the region. To support that tourism, the state of Missouri is giving $74 million, and Kansas is chipping in $28 million.
Infantino, once a Trump critic, now considers the MAGA leader a friend. FIFA’s ethics committee has been asked to investigate whether Infantino violated the organization’s neutrality rules in giving Trump the peace prize. From a business standpoint, it might seem like a bauble to keep him happy.
But why would Trump accept such a prize when it is so obviously absurd?
He must know that, coming on the heels of his Nobel disappointment, it appears to be some kind of poor substitute. There has been sport over this at Trump’s expense, but the joke is probably on us.
We’ve been here before.
Or at least the world has.
When the 1934 World Cup was hosted by Italy, dictator Benito Mussolini seized the opportunity to turn sport into propaganda.
Consider the official poster, the work of illustrator Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, an early adherent of Italian Fascism and the author of the “Futurist Manifesto.” It presaged a new movement that would glorify war; scorn women; and worship technology, destruction and speed. His World Cup poster is bold and unsettling, a dynamic male figure in an Italian national team shirt poised to kick the living daylights out of a brown ball, a fasces tucked into one corner.
“Mussolini was no great soccer fan, but he recognized the sport’s power both in terms of projecting an image of strength and in bringing the country together,” writes Jonathan Wilson in his 2025 book, “The Power and the Glory: The History of the World Cup.”
From its inception, Wilson writes, soccer has always been about far more than soccer. FIFA was organized in 1904, but the first World Cup wasn’t held until 1930, in Uruguay. In 1934, the cup was still new enough that much of the football world, including England, simply decided to sit the games out. But for Mussolini, the World Cup was a way to project fascist strength. He made himself central to the games, famously paying for his own tickets and watching from the stands as Italy kicked the daylights out of the United States.
Mussolini also created a trophy — the “Coppa del Duce” — as an additional prize to be given to the winner.
Sculpted in bronze, the trophy depicted players in front of the fasces — the axe and bundle that was the symbol of ancient Rome, co-opted by the fascists. It was also six times the size of the Jules Rimet, the original World Cup trophy named for FIFA’s longest-serving president. That trophy depicted the Greek goddess Victory and was used from 1930 to 1970. The current trophy, in use since 1974, is a somewhat abstract representation of two athletes exulting in victory.
I prefer the look of the old trophy, but alas it was stolen in 1983. All that’s ever been found is the stone base.
Now, I understand that Trump is no Mussolini.
But he is Il Duce-like in his awareness of image, and by placing himself center stage at the World Cup, he is reaching a vast global audience where football is played with a white ball and you can’t touch it with your hands. Typically, when the word “vast” is used it’s mostly hype, but in this case no other description comes close. FIFA is projecting that 6 billion people will watch at least one of the games, up about a billion from the last World Cup.
That is 75% of the world’s population.
How many people in the world know who won the Nobel Peace Prize?
If you know it was María Corina Machado of Venezuela, pat yourself on the back. You’re part of the informed minority. Machado, who was awarded the prize for her peaceful efforts to overthrow Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorship, has dedicated the prize to Trump and now supports the use of force for regime change.
Hear that? I’m doing a forehead slap.
The world has become as dangerous as it was in 1934, if not more so. Let’s see, there was something else I was going to mention about dictators and sports. Oh yes, it was this: two years after Mussolini muscled his way to the forefront of the World Cup, another leader — Adolf Hitler — used the Olympics in Berlin to show the world the strength of the Nazi regime. But Jesse Owens taught the Führer a thing or two about the myth of the master race.
Save your cards and letters. I’m not saying Trump is Mussolini or Hitler.
But the tune sounds familiar.
Just about everyone with a screen of any kind — a computer, a smartphone, or communal access to a television — is expected to watch come summer. If they’re not plugged in individually, they’ll be gathered in schools or pubs, experiencing perhaps the national thrill of victory or the cold embrace of defeat, but at some point they are bound to have seen an image of Trump clutching that damned trophy, and for some the image will stick.
A man of peace.
Never mind the dozens of blown-to-bits occupants of the small boats in the Caribbean and the murder of the two survivors of the first strike, on Sept. 2. Never mind that just days after receiving the dread object, he seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast as part of a massive military buildup that appears ready to topple the Maduro regime.
For my part, I will avoid as much of the World Cup nonsense as possible. If it’s on a television I have control of, I’ll change the channel. If it pops up on my feed, I’ll swipe past. No ads for World Cup merch will sway me. The “peace prize” alone was enough to persuade me not to spend a single dollar on anything related to FIFA or the World Cup. Well, I did buy Wilson’s book, but that taught me how politics have always been deeply embedded in the history of soccer.
Meanwhile, I’ll watch how plans for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles are shaping up. Politico reports that nearly all of the new board members to the Olympic planning committee have MAGA ties.
I hope Haiti wins the Cup.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-14 09:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Coming January to Metro-North: Ticket turmoil,Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/14/metro-north-ticket-turmoil/,"If you’re a Metro-North rider in Connecticut, get ready for January's complete rewiring of how train tickets will work.","If you’re a Metro-North rider in Connecticut, already juggling limited parking, train delays, and the usual commuter indignities, get ready for something new in January. 
Not a fare hike (for once), but a complete rewiring of how train tickets will work, courtesy of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. All this comes under the guise of a “better customer experience.”



Let’s get one thing straight before the panic sets in: Connecticut is not raising rail fares in January. That’s just in New York, so if you only consume NYC-media’s recent coverage of this story you are understandably confused.
However… another 5% hike that the Connecticut Department of Transportation approved for the our trains will hit in July 2026. Just classic Connecticut: slow, steady, predictable fiscal pain: higher fares, worsening service.
Why the need for fare hikes at all? In part, because of fare evasion. 
The New York City Citizens Budget Commission estimates the MTA loses $1 billion a year because of that problem, $46 million on Metro-North and the Long Island Railraod alone. And on NYC buses (soon to be made “free” under Mayor-elect Mamdani?), 45% of riders already just jump aboard without paying.
So, in part, the fare hikes are like that “public benefits” surcharge on your electric bill:  the rest of us pick up the tab for uncollectable bills.
January’s big changes affecting us? The new MTA ticketing rules which absolutely do apply to Connecticut riders because we share the system, just with different fare hike schedules.
One way tickets will self-destruct at 4 a.m.

One of the new Metro-North Railroad ticket machines., Credit: MTA

Buy a ticket today, use it by 4 a.m. tomorrow, or it evaporates. “Poof!” The MTA markets this as “flexibility.” Commuters might call it “gotcha, but make it digital.” Late for the train because you couldn’t activate your ticket in a cellphone dead-zone? Or “forget” to activate that e-ticket before the conductor comes around? That’ll cost you a $2 onboard surcharge, a fee whose primary purpose appears to be reminding you who’s in charge.
Roundtrip tickets… GONE!
They’re being replaced by the new “Day Pass,” valid until 4 a.m. the next morning and good for unlimited travel that day. Great for joy-riding and easier for conductors to scan. But more convenient for riders? Well, maybe.
Ten-trip tickets… also gone.
In their place comes a “mobile pay-as-you-go reward:” buy 10 trips within 14 days and the 11th is free. It’s the kind of loyalty program only a government agency could invent: stick around long enough, pay full price consistently, and eventually you’ll get something resembling a perk. Even Dunkin’ has a better frequent customer program.
And again, all of these rule changes apply equally to riders from Connecticut and New York because the MTA controls the fare products (with CDOT’s blessing) even on Connecticut-run service. And all this applies to Metro-North, Shore Line East and Hartford Line trains.
What Connecticut riders are getting in January is a system that’s more complex, less forgiving, and seems designed with the breezy assumption that Metro-North passengers have the time and mental bandwidth to memorize expiring tickets, activation rules, and mobile-only discounts.
So enjoy this moment of clarity. Your ticket rules are changing in January, but your ticket prices are not… at least not yet. In today’s commuter world, maybe that almost qualifies as a holiday stocking-stuffer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metro-North-new-tix-machine-1024x805.jpg,,,2025-12-14 04:56:21.002950
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-14 02:02:57+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,We can’t sit idle as Washington pulls the plug on the Massachusetts innovation economy,Eric Nakajima,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/we-cant-sit-idle-as-washington-pulls-the-plug-on-the-massachusetts-innovation-economy/,"The Commonwealth needs to act boldly and creatively to respond to the threats to its innovation economy. Fighting to reverse these moves in Washington should be a top priority, but we surely can’t count on that happening.","MASSACHUSETTS HAS EXPERIENCED a full assault on the basic pillars of our innovation economy. Clean energy programs and infrastructure, biomedical research funding, immigration, and core funding and academic freedom at our state’s leading universities have all landed in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s reckless cuts and ideologically extreme policy agenda.  
While President Trump wraps this all in America First rhetoric, these moves will severely undermine our country’s ability to compete economically and remain a global leader in cutting-edge research and development. Given the outsized role these areas play here, the threat to Massachusetts is particularly acute.  
The Commonwealth needs to act boldly and creatively to respond to the threats to its innovation economy. Fighting to reverse these moves in Washington should be a top priority, but we surely can’t count on that happening. We may not be able, on our own, to mitigate the full impact of these harmful policies, but we can take action at the state level to counter their effects.  
Over the summer, Gov. Healey unveiled a proposal to do just that. The Discovery, Research and Innovation for a Vibrant Economy, or DRIVE, Initiative includes a call for $400 million in state appropriations to help make up for some of the lost federal funding.  
Committing public dollars to help bolster or jumpstart economic activity is not something that should be done lightly without due diligence and careful consideration. But in weighing the governor’s proposal, legislative leaders don’t have to look back too far for an example of unquestionable success with such a strategy.  
It may be hard to remember, but Massachusetts wasn’t always the leading state for the innovation economy. In 2003, despite our state’s deep strengths in finance, health care, and higher education, the major economic story of the day was Boston losing Fortune 500 headquarters. 
The Commonwealth had invested heavily in remaking Boston’s downtown and waterfront, but 20 years ago the Seaport was best known for inexpensive parking lots. The state’s economy had crashed in 2001, and it was only slowly regaining the jobs lost during the recession. In 2004, the Boston Foundation bemoaned the fact that greater Boston “lacked the collaborative gene,” which was essential to competing in the global knowledge economy. There was significant pessimism disguised as realism – which all made sense if you were a fan of the Boston Red Sox during the many decades leading to October of that momentous year. 
As seen in the sudden reversal that year of our baseball fortunes, however, the world changes – sometimes quicker than you expect. I served in the Patrick administration during both of the governor’s terms, eventually as the state’s first assistant secretary for innovation policy in the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, and witnessed this firsthand.  
Working under Secretary Dan O’Connell and the late Secretary Greg Bialecki, both of whom helmed the housing and economic development secretariat under Gov. Patrick, I had a chance to see and participate in initiatives that had a catalytic effect on the state’s innovation economy. 
In 2008, Gov. Patrick and the Legislature partnered to launch the state’s 10-year, $1 billion Life Sciences Initiative, which served as a catalyst for regional partnerships and international investment.   
The scale of the initiative drew international attention and investment in Massachusetts, while the vast majority of the state funds invested (over 70 percent of funds through FY 2014) were spent on research and development infrastructure and educational programs throughout the state. A 2018 impact study showed that Massachusetts outperformed peer states in life sciences wage and job growth from 2009 through 2016, providing evidence that the initiative did make a meaningful difference in improving the state’s competitiveness.   
In 2009, the state provided seed funding for MassChallenge, one of the world’s largest startup accelerators and competitions. Anyone who attended a MassChallenge event can readily attest that it had a dynamic effect – as if a world-class region was meeting itself for the first time. MassChallenge reinforced the state’s international reputation for innovation while also supporting the state’s entrepreneurial ecosystem by inviting winners from regional startup accelerators to join its program. 
In 2012, the state’s five largest research universities partnered to open the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center – a major research facility – in Holyoke. It was the first significant collaboration to ever take place among these universities – and there, too, a seed investment by the state was critical to its success. Through the computing center, the partner universities have sponsored collaborative research by faculty across their schools and with external partners, with the goal to make our state more competitive for major federal research funding opportunities. 
Unquestionably, the Commonwealth is right to focus on a triad of long-term challenges that threaten our economic health and competitiveness: affordable housing, education and workforce development, and safe and efficient transportation. Progress in those areas creates a more livable state for all of us and unlocks bottlenecks to hiring and growth. But it won’t be enough to forestall the worst impacts of current federal policy. 
The actions of the federal government strike at the very heart of our state’s competitive advantage. Massachusetts is a magnet for the world’s talent, from undergraduate students to postdocs to regional headquarters for major multinational corporations. We thrive on collaboration and the sophistication of our experienced researchers, investors, executives, advanced manufacturers, and technicians.   
Collaboration is at the heart of our success. And collaboration requires trust, mutually agreed upon goals, resources, and sufficient stability over time to execute on plans. It requires belief, hope, and expectation that hard work will lead to accomplishment, whether that is in six months, a year or five years. The state investments described above succeeded in part because they were sustained commitments that improved capacity and created a reliable state partner that enabled the private sector and universities to make long-term plans and investments of their own.    
That’s why it is imperative that our state’s leaders – from government, education, and industry – partner and respond robustly to this threat.  
The House and Senate, with whatever modifications they deem appropriate, should move quickly to pass the DRIVE Act, which is designed to stabilize and grow our state’s research and innovation ecosystem. Roughly half of the funds would be devoted to backfilling some of the support for our universities, investing in promising research proposals that went through rigorous scientific review prior to the federal cuts.  
The second half of the funds would support new collaborative research and initiatives that can accelerate our innovation economy. For new initiatives, the Commonwealth should require substantial direct and in-kind matches to magnify the impact of state dollars. In addition, the state should be ambitious in choosing initiatives that bring together multiple partners and advance national research priorities that have been defunded or opposed by the Trump administration. 
We are, eventually, going to come out of this unsettling era. How we do so is up to us. In a moment in which fear and uncertainty abound, we should set the goal for Massachusetts to emerge as the strongest, most competitive innovation state in the nation in 2029.

Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. has said he would like to see more public-private partnerships related to public spaces in the city. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The fate of one of Omaha’s oldest public parks brought roughly 50 people Saturday to a meeting that included impassioned remarks from community and civic leaders, a Nebraska lawmaker and a City Council member.
At issue is a proposed arrangement that would place the operation of North Omaha’s Miller Park in the hands of a private philanthropic foundation, the Lozier Foundation. 
Some have questioned the setup, though city officials hosting the meeting reaffirmed that the 80-acre park would remain open to the public and owned by the city. Maintenance and programming would be paid for and managed by Lozier under a “Miller Park Trust” contract yet to be presented to the City Council.
Saturday’s meeting at Nelson Mandela Elementary School, across the street from Miller Park, was intended to gain community input. Mandela school is a nonprofit entity funded by a donor group led by the Lozier Foundation. 
Miller Park’s development dates back to the 1890s.
Omaha mayor sees public benefit to putting city park in hands of private foundation

Several community members voiced concern that the proposal was moving too quickly and sought assurance that North Omahans would not get short-shrifted.
Anthony Karefa Rogers-Wright recognized the work and improvements Lozier has made in the area and said his skepticism and search for more transparency is rooted in past “malfeasance” of city government and “how it’s spending the people’s money.”
Nancy Williams of No More Empty Pots has been a neighborhood resident for three decades. Her kids attended school in the area and she said she’s seen the park transform for the better as the Lozier Foundation has invested millions into improving trails, the fountain, the pavilion and sponsoring concerts and programming.
“The issue is fear and trust,” of being let down by other sources and officials in the past, she said. “People have not felt seen and heard.” 
Terri Sanders, owner and publisher of the Omaha Star newspaper, which focuses on the Black community, suggested it was time to trust those leading the effort.
“North Omaha suffers for lack of pulling the trigger,” she said. “Pull the trigger and let it fly.”
Omaha officials leading the meeting, including aides to Mayor John Ewing Jr. Jacqueline Morrison and Thomas Warren, distributed a “myth vs. fact” sheet and said the Ewing-backed arrangement with the foundation will help improve public spaces when a city budget is ill-equipped to do so.
Warren said a study of the city’s more than 250 parks revealed a “woefully underfunded” Parks and Recreation Department that needed $5 million to bring it up to par. He said the agreement with Lozier Foundation would free up city resources for other parks and services.
Lozier Foundation representatives also were present and outlined the organization’s investments in the past decade at Miller Park, including a splash pad, soccer wall and pavilion renovation.
Among the city’s points:

If approved, Lozier would pay an estimated $800,000 annually to operate and maintain the park starting in mid-2026. The contract still has to be voted on by the City Council. City officials said they hoped that a three-step process could begin before the year’s end. 
The proposal is for 10 years, however the city retains the ability to end the agreement at any time.

Nancy Gaarder, president of the Miller Park Minne Lusa Neighborhood Association, said the park was a “mess” before the foundation invested.
“Lozier did the city’s job,” said Gaarder, and referred to notable performing artists the foundation brought to the park that she said helped build community relationships.

Upkeep is critical for environmental and health measures, she said, citing stagnant water and possibly toxic algae of the fountain prior to improvements. Gaarder advocated for the trust arrangement. 
State Sen. Ashley Spivey of North Omaha said she will continue to monitor the situation that affects her legislative district. “Sounds like people want this but want the right parameters.”
LaVonya Goodwin, who represents the neighborhood on the City Council, said the attention people are paying to the matter shows they care about the community she said has suffered from decades of neglect. 
She said public-private partnerships work but that she’ll continue to listen to constituents as the contract terms develop.
“We want people to know their voices matter, their concerns matter and long term … that this park is a place the community can be proud of,” Goodwin said.

Providence Mayor Brett Smiley confirmed at a press […]","Google Maps shows the location of the 'Brown University shooting' at the Barus and Holley engineering building on Saturday afternoon. A manhunt continued early evening, (Google images)PROVIDENCE — Two people have died and several others were wounded in a mass shooting in a Brown University engineering building late Saturday afternoon, prompting a shelter in place alert on the Ivy League campus and a massive search for a gunman that continued into the evening.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley confirmed at a press conference that began shortly after 6:30 p.m. that at least two people were killed with “a minimum of eight” more injured and in critical condition “but stable at Rhode Island Hospital.” 
Smiley could not disclose whether the victims were Brown students.
“These numbers may change,” Smiley said. “We are still in early hours.” 
The shooting in the Barus and Holley building on Brook Street occurred as final exams were taking place between 2 and 5 p.m. inside Barus & Holley Engineering, Provost Francis J. Doyle III said.
Providence Police Cmdr. Tim O’Hara described the suspect as a man who was wearing black. The suspect left the engineering building’s Hope Street side. O’Hara said that police did not know what type of gun was used.
Forensic and witness evidence were being used to identify the suspect, and the police were primarily relying on video evidence at the moment, O’Hara said. 
“All I can give you is a male, all dressed in black, right now,” O’Hara said of the suspect.
The suspect walked away from the area, and law enforcement were unsure where he had gone as of 6:50 p.m. 
Smiley said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also involved in the investigation.
Gov. Dan McKee spoke at the Saturday evening press briefing. “So, the unthinkable has happened,” McKee said. 
Providence Fire Chief Derek Silva said the fire department was first alerted about the shooting at 4:05 p.m. 
Brown sent out its first emergency alert at 4:22 p.m., noting “an active shooter near Barus & Holley Engineering.” The alert cautioned the campus community to lock doors, silence phones and “stay hidden until further notice.” The alert also advised the options of run, hide, or, “FIGHT, as a last resort.”
An update at 4:51 p.m. noted a suspect was in custody, only to be redacted in a 5:11 p.m. update that read, “Police do not have a suspect in custody and continue to search for suspect(s).” The post also advised students to continue to shelter in place. 
Smiley said at the press conference that the individual in the 4:51 p.m. update had been mistakenly connected to the incident.  
At 5:27 p.m., another emergency alert reported shots fired near Governor Street. That update was also reversed at 6:10 p.m., which added that “a secondary shooting incident near Governor Street is unfounded.” 
The erroneous update from 4:51 p.m. noting a suspect was in custody made its way to President Donald Trump, who wrote on his TruthSocial site at 5:44 p.m. that he had been briefed on the shooting and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was “on the scene.”
“The suspect is in custody,” Trump wrote. “God bless the victims and the families of the victims!”
At 6:03 p.m., Trump posted again: “The Brown University Police reversed their previous statement — The suspect is NOT in custody.”
“We are very sorry to share that we have confirmed reports of multiple shooting victims, but we are not able to share their condition,” the University wrote in a statement issued at 6:05 p.m. “They have been transported to local hospitals.”
The Brown emergency updates page first confirmed that there were “multiple shooting victims” at 6:05 p.m. The university could not share their conditions at the time, but noted they were “transported to local hospitals.”
Rescues and other apparatus from surrounding municipalities responded to the campus, including Bristol, Barrington, Central Falls, Cranston, Cumberland, Coventry, East Greenwich, North Kingstown, Scituate, Smithfield, Warwick and Woonsocket.
At 6:17 p.m., a call cleared rescues to return to their home communities.
“Sadly, today is a day that the city of Providence, the state of Rhode Island, prayed would never come,” Smiley said. “We’ve heard about horrific acts of gun violence and active shooter situations in other places, but not here.”
Smiley, who lives in the area, told reporters he was at home watching the Providence College Friars when he saw police lights fill the surrounding neighborhood.
This story will be updated.

(Krisanapong Detraphiphat/Getty Images)The battle over who should oversee Georgia’s Medicaid program could be coming to an end, and the decision could have a major impact on Georgia families in need.
The fighting started last year after the state awarded contracts to four companies: CareSource, which previously held a contract with the state, and newcomers Molina Health Care, UnitedHealthcare and Humana. Two companies that had been contracting with the state previously, Peach State Health Plan and Amerigroup, lost their bids.
Georgia’s Medicaid program covers about 2.2 million people in the state at a price of $16 billion, according to KFF data.
The Georgia Department of Administrative Services heard arguments Thursday from Peach State and Amerigroup, who say the selection process was unfair, and the winners who remain pleased with the way things went. It comes after the department denied protests against the decisions last month.
James Washburn from law firm Nelson Mullins, arguing on behalf of Amerigroup Georgia, said the department erred, pointing to documents from Georgia Division of Family and Children Services Director and Department of Human Services Commissioner Candice Broce that he said show an effort to lobby government officials against Amerigroup as “part of an effort to shift blame from her agency to Amerigroup for performance issues.”
“The fact that Commissioner Broce expressly asked the DCH Commissioner to deny AmeriGroup a contract is the best kind of bias evidence you can find,” Washburn said at Thursday’s hearing.
Amerigroup and Peach State also argued that there were irregularities in the scoring process and that United does not meet requirements for statewide coverage, particularly when it comes to psychiatric care and treatments used by people with autism.
Attorneys representing the winning bidders argued that the protests were meritless.
“Amerigroup and Peach State bombed the test,” said attorney Alex Hontos with law firm Dorsey and Whitney, arguing for United. “They finished fifth and eighth, and when they bombed the test, instead of taking that on board and coming back and doing better the next time, studying harder, what did they do? They attacked the teacher. They attacked the test. They say that there was bias. They say that there was something wrong with the process. That’s what you’re looking at here.”
The debate means more than just dollars for the millions of people who receive care through Georgia’s Medicaid program, and that includes more than 11,000 kids in foster care who receive care primarily through Medicaid.
Ahead of Thursday’s hearing, a group of foster parents and advocates held a rally outside the state Capitol to call on the department to reject the plan to swap providers.

John DeGarmo, founder of an advocacy group called the Foster Care Institute and a foster parent to more than 60 kids in Georgia, said the plan would move foster kids from Amerigroup to United, which could mean children potentially losing access to care if they do not live near providers who accept United.
DeGarmo and others said they are especially worried about foster children with autism after ProPublica released a report that found the company has a policy to cut costs by denying effective and necessary treatments for children with autism.
DeGarmo said it’s unfair to force foster children already dealing with trauma to risk losing access to medical professionals, and he worries requiring foster parents to jump through more hoops to take care of children in need will make it less likely that people begin or continue fostering.
“An inability for children to receive health care locally will exacerbate foster parent burnout faster than anything I could think of,” he said. “And that’s what foster parents are talking about right now, burnout and compassion fatigue.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-13 22:21:21+00:00,CT Mirror,Water main bursts in Waterbury; Thousands without water,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/13/waterbury-water-main-break/,"Waterbury, Wolcott and Watertown were largely without water after an explosive main break, forcing a scramble to keep two hospitals open.","The catastrophic failure of a high-pressure line in Waterbury’s aging water system left Connecticut’s fifth largest city and most of two suburbs, Wolcott and Watertown, without water Saturday, forcing a scramble to keep open two hospitals and bring in water by tankers and truckloads of bottles.
City officials said an earlier failure of a 10-inch water line installed in 1901 undermined a 42-inch, 55-year-old transmission main that burst with explosive force late Friday night on Thomaston Avenue by Waterville Park, launching pavement into the air and shattering windows.
With damage still being assessed and no firm timetable for restoration, the break prompted a massive response by city and state agencies, including the National Guard and state Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security. School was canceled for Monday in Waterbury, and the city’s restaurants were ordered closed.
Fire hydrants were nonfunctional, and in the few areas where the taps had limited pressure, the water was not safe to drink without out boiling. Using plans developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the state and city prepared to distribute water at two locations no later than Sunday.
“The Guard is here. We’re going to have water distribution, potable water, big racks of it, a little like what we had in Rentschler Field during COVID,” Gov. Ned Lamont said in a midday briefing with Mayor Paul K. Pernerewski Jr. at Waterbury’s public works headquarters.
The consequences of the failure are unprecedented, amplified by the city’s belated program to upgrade infrastructure after decades of neglect. A second high-pressure main that could have provided nearly uninterrupted service was off line, being reinforced with a thick plastic liner.
“We had planned on pressure-testing that on Monday, chlorinating it, and samples were going to go out next week to clear it to be put back in use,” said Brad Malay, the city’s water superintendent.
The rupture occurred on one of the two high-pressure lines that feed the system from a city-owned water treatment plant miles away in Thomaston. 
“The 1970 main was actually fine, but when the 1901 main failed, it washed out the other main. They reside across the road from each other,” Malay said. “And due to the age the fragility of those pipes, it doesn’t take a lot for those pipes to, you know, let go.”
Water from the plant to the main was cut off, but water still flowed from the break more than 12 hours after the rupture as the system emptied. Valves that could have localized the impact were fragile and could not be closed, officials said.
“The biggest problem that we have that causes the most trouble, frankly, are the valves, because you could isolate breaks and leaks along the way that would have the most minimal impact,” Pernerewski said. “The problem we have is that we get to a lot of these valves, and we go to tighten them and shut them, they don’t work. We can’t get them closed, and so we have to spread the bigger and bigger areas that get affected by it. And that’s part of the problem that we’re having here.”
Malay said new valves are now tested every six months at his order, by “exercising” them, essentially closing and opening them, but the older ones are not. The risk is greater than the reward, he said.
“Once a valve reaches a certain point, nobody wants to touch it, because you don’t want to break it by exercising it, and then be the guy who’s now caused the problem,” he said. “So everybody leaves it alone until the guy who needs to close it. And it’s been 25 years since anybody touched it.”
Waterbury, a city that fell into insolvency and state oversight a quarter century ago, is in the midst of a $30 million program to strengthen a water system built to meet the needs of a once-thriving brass industry and the dense neighborhoods that housed its workers.
“The problem is that even if you had enough money to do it all at once, you cannot simply replace the entire system at once, because you’d have to shut it down. So you have to do it in discrete parts,” Pernerewski said.
The city is doing what it can, he said. This time, a major break came at the worst time, when the backup was under repair.
“We just unluckily got caught this year with a couple bad breaks on our transmission needs,” Malay said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/waterbury_water-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-13 17:56:45.326774

Dan McKeon of Amherst. Oct. 24, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers are recommending State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst be expelled from the Legislature following allegations that he groped a staffer after a sine die party earlier this year. 
The Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board, its group of 10 senators in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the Legislature, voted unanimously Saturday to recommend McKeon’s expulsion, save for State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, who was unable to attend due to the winter weather. She confirmed to the Examiner that she also would have voted yes on the motion based on the Legislature’s existing policy.

Expulsion is the strongest disciplinary measure the board can recommend, but it requires a full vote of the Legislature to pass. This means the matter will come before lawmakers during the 60-day legislative session that begins in January. 
The recommendation stems from allegations by a legislative staffer attending an end-of-session party earlier this year. The Nebraska State Patrol received a report in September that McKeon had allegedly “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” according to Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas.
The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
The Patrol cited McKeon for misdemeanor public indecency. The Lancaster County Attorney recently downgraded the allegation to a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace. McKeon’s arraignment on the separate criminal charge is set forWednesday. 
In a statement from Executive Board Chair State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair on behalf of the committee, the board concluded the expulsion recommendation was necessary “in light of a demonstrated pattern of behavior by Senator McKeon and not in response to a single isolated incident.”
“Board members emphasized that the action was taken to protect the integrity of the Nebraska Legislature and to uphold the standards expected of its members,” Hansen’s statement reads.
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon’s biographical page on the Legislature’s website highlights that he has been married for 30 years and has four children.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign. Pillen stood by his statement when asked Saturday. 
McKeon’s attorney Perry Pirsch has said McKeon “is guilty of nothing but a bad pun and pat on the back.” He said McKeon has cooperated with the Executive Board’s requests so far, and would continue to do so for “reasonable requests.”

“The Legislature should be careful not to allow unadjudicated, contested allegations drive them to drastic decisions,” Pirsch previously said by email. “They are setting a dangerous precedent if they assume the worst and take actions based on nothing but contested allegations.”
Pirsch did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Executive Board’s Saturday vote. 
The Executive Board had met at least twice previously to discuss the situation, according to Hansen. The group’s second meeting on the matter, Dec. 8, adjourned without reaching a resolution because Hansen wanted the full board to weigh in on the decision. 
During the board’s first meeting on McKeon Oct. 27, Hansen said the group agreed to move McKeon’s former first-floor office, exchanging it with another first-floor office previously occupied by State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. Hansen did not specify why the board did so.

The Snohomish Regional Fire and Rescue water rescue technician was here near Monroe, saving people, as closed roads became ponds. Down the road, a Dodge Grand Caravan was still partially submerged Saturday morning. The agency rescued over three dozen people in total, said Battalion Chief Jamal Beckham. Statewide, at least 250 have been rescued.

On Saturday morning, local, state and federal elected officials, including Gov. Bob Ferguson, U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray and U.S. Reps. Suzan DelBene and Kim Schrier, surveyed the aftermath. 
The flooding, while still historic, mercifully didn’t quite reach the extreme levels initially predicted. No deaths or significant injuries have been reported, Ferguson said. 
“This event came very close to being much more catastrophic, very close, and this reality should serve as a warning and opportunity to strengthen our preparedness and resilience for the next event,” Snohomish Regional Fire and Rescue Chief Brian Park told the elected leaders at Station 31 in Monroe. 
Snohomish County officials had called in state water rescue teams to help, but sent them up north to Skagit and Whatcom counties because of how well local fire departments were managing along the U.S. 2 corridor. 
Many of the nearby farmers chose to stay, building dikes around their livestock, Huber explained. 
“They’ve seen it this level, I think maybe not themselves, but their grandpa probably worked through that one,” he said. 
Many animals, though, ended up at the nearby Evergreen Fairgrounds. At its height, the equestrian park there housed 171 horses, 140 chickens, 104 cattle, 94 goats, three rabbits and two turkeys, said Mike Ohlsen, the fair manager.
Water was still receding Saturday after record flooding hit Snohomish and Skagit counties. A sunny Saturday serves as respite before the rain returns on Sunday.
Reid Wolcott, the warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Seattle, said 4 to 7 inches of rain could be in store for parts of the Cascades, which could fuel more river flooding. Strong winds, with gusts up to 45 to 50 mph, could also sweep into the region over the next day or two, he said, posing a risk of toppled trees and power lines.
The National Weather Service is forecasting additional heavy rain. This map shows predicted rainfall totals from Saturday, Dec. 13 at 10 a.m. through Tuesday, Dec. 16 at 4 a.m. The forecast was issued on Dec. 13 at 11:18 a.m. (Map courtesy of NWS Seattle)
“We’re not out of the woods,” Wolcott said. “We’re halfway through.”
By mid-week, temperatures are forecast to fall, and snow levels will drop to lower elevations, reducing the amount of water flowing into rivers.
After touring around Monroe, Ferguson and others headed up to Mount Vernon, where officials were relieved the waters didn’t breach a floodwall protecting the city’s downtown. 
Thousands of people remain under evacuation orders, mostly in Skagit County. State officials said Friday it could be days or weeks before evacuees can return to their homes. A long stretch of U.S. 2 between Skykomish and Leavenworth remains closed.
Some relief from the federal government has arrived in Washington, said Ferguson. 
President Donald Trump on Friday signed an emergency declaration to give the state federal aid to respond to the flooding. Federal personnel are working with local authorities on rescuing stranded people, clearing debris from roads and other emergent needs, the governor said.

Assessing the damage to get further federal aid for the recovery will come later. Unlocking that additional support, including assistance for individuals, will require the feds to approve a disaster declaration. 
“We’re looking at millions of dollars of infrastructure damage,” said Snohomish County Emergency Management Director Lucia Schmit. “These are small towns, small cities, diking districts that don’t have the funding. This is a catastrophic financial burden for them.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-2-debris-slide-December-2025-floods.jpg,,,2025-12-13 17:56:45.326774

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Nearly four months after President Joseph Savoie stepped down, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette has begun organizing the search to replace him. The UL System will convene a search committee in January and present finalists in late February, the system board announced Thursday.
The committee’s roster is in development but not final, UL System President Mark Romero told The Acadiana Advocate Thursday. The job will be officially posted in January and marketed nationally. The system published a website for the search last week.
UL Lafayette is currently led by Interim President Ramesh Kolluru, who replaced Provost Jaimie Hebert as interim last month. The system board was reportedly ready to forego a search and name Kolluru to the permanent post at last month’s meeting. Facing backlash, the board committed to a search.
Meanwhile, the university continues to hack its way through a substantial budget deficit revealed earlier this year. Kolluru told faculty and staff this week that further austerity is needed to close what remains of a $50 million gap.
After taking over as interim, Kolluru eliminated the positions of three top administrators and this week announced a leadership reorganization, elevating key staffers from his research division.
A longtime ULL employee and “honorary Cajun,” Kolluru has made no secret that he wants the permanent job.

The “Sound of Church” tour began in Vicksburg on Nov. 23. Services across the state are scheduled through Dec. 21.
Jerry Mannery, the choir’s executive director, said that the tour is an opportunity to spread the Gospel to the communities where its members grew up and lived. 
“We understand that we are first and foremost ambassadors for Christ, and secondly we are ambassadors for the state of Mississippi as well,” he said.
Lillian Lilly of Belhaven is a lead singer, a soprano and one of the original members. She said she felt the Holy Spirit directing her to join the choir.
Lilly said the choir is like a big extended family. She is one of several members whose biological relatives – her son, daughter and granddaughter – are also in the choir.
“It’s a real spiritual experience to sing in church,” she said.
“We’ve had a wonderful time.”
Yolanda Clay-Moore is the choir’s marketing director and soprano singer. She has performed with the choir since 2012. She moved to Brandon when she was 10, and the Mississippi Mass Choir’s music was a major part of her church experience growing up. 
Clay-Moore considers it an honor to be part of the choir and still considers herself a fan.
When asked what she hopes audiences will take away from the services, she said, “The number one goal is always to bring someone to Christ, or to reunite them with Christ.” 
Gospel singer Frank Williams founded the Mississippi Mass Choir in 1988. Today, the choir has 214 members, has released 13 albums and has numerous achievements, including four Grammy nominations and a Stellar Gospel Music Lifetime Achievement Award.
Mannery has been the choir’s executive director since Williams’ death in 1993. 
“Right now this is a very difficult time to live in, and people are really under a lot of pressure, and people are bound by a lot of things that are outside of their control,” Mannery said. 
“But we know that when the spirit of the Lord shows up through our songs, that it sets people free,” he added.

Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) and former Michigan GOP Co-Chair Bernadette SmithEstablishment Republicans in Michigan and nationally are counting out former state GOP co-chair Bernadette Smith in her bid to steal away votes, and maybe the nomination, from party favorite Mike Rogers. 
But sharp differences between the two on the Affordable Care Act, as the issue flares again in Washington, D.C., could give voters a clearer contrast in the race.
Rogers, a former mid-Michigan congressman who now lives in White Lake, is the frontrunner in the race for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination. Up until recently, he was the only big name politician worth pulling for in the race, but Smith’s exit from state party leadership to run against Rogers in the August primary has set up a challenge. 
Bernadette Smith makes her U.S. Senate bid against Rogers official

Republicans in Michigan doubt that Smith can gather enough signatures to make it to the ballot in Michigan, but if she does, and raises enough money to compete with Rogers, it could place a few speed bumps on his path to an easy party nomination.
Despite those challenges for Smith, she’s already tying herself to positions that Rogers opposes. That appears to now include the renewed fight on Capitol Hill over the Affordable Care Act’s expiring premium credits and subsidies.
Politico noted on Friday the policy difference between Rogers and Smith as Republicans fail to unify on a plan to either let them expire and offer a new plan, which focuses on the creation of health savings accounts; or to save the subsidies in the short term as the GOP works to maintain power for another cycle. 
That plan could buy the party some time to craft a suitable replacement to the government marketplace insurance program that has come to be known as Obamacare, which lawmakers have tried but failed mightily to replace with a new program since its inception.
That fight has created rifts in the GOP caucus and primary contenders, Politico reported, putting vulnerable incumbents at risk heading into the 2026 midterm elections.
Rogers, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, has advocated for a wholly new marketplace health care system. Meanwhile, Smith has advocated for the two-year extension to buy that time.
Gutting the Affordable Care Act, by killing the program altogether or chipping away at its core pieces to make the rest of the system unworkable, has proved unpopular with voters over the past nearly two decades, all in the face of repeated Republican attempts to do so.
Smith could be angling to catch independent-minded Republicans or those unopposed to the marketplace health care system, potentially pulling them away from Rogers who has taken a stance more in line with Trump and GOP leadership who again have the Affordable Care Act in their sights for repeal.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1194-1024x579.jpg,,,2025-12-13 07:57:01.262305

He grew up in the Yakima Valley town of Prosser, and is the younger brother of New Orleans Saints head coach Kellen Moore.
Kirby Moore was a wide receiver at Boise State from 2009-2013, then started his coaching career at the College of Idaho in 2014. Moore spent the next two seasons at the University of Washington, working as a graduate assistant and offensive assistant.
A press conference introducing Moore will be held next Tuesday. Terms of his contract were not disclosed.
“Coach Moore is the real deal, and exactly who we needed to propel us to the top of the new Pac-12,” WSU President Elizabeth Cantwell said Friday. “Our student-athletes have lucked out.”
Moore said in a statement that, “Becoming a first-time head coach at a special place like Washington State is a dream come true for my family and I.”  
WSU’s football coach is paid well over $1 million a year. Despite that salary, the position has seen recent turnover due to a combination of the pandemic and two ambitious coaches using WSU as a stepping stone.
The coaching turmoil comes as WSU seeks to stanch dropping enrollment while remaining relevant in the turbulent college football landscape. 
Cantwell has said repeatedly that a successful football program is key to reversing an enrollment decline of some 6,000 students at WSU in recent years. That starts with the right coach as Washington State University transitions to the new-look Pac-12 next season.
The highest-paid employees of the state of Washington are almost always the football and men’s basketball coaches at the University of Washington and WSU, each making well over $1 million per year. By contrast, Gov. Bob Ferguson makes about $230,000 annually.
Rogers was hired away from South Dakota State last winter for a salary of $1.57 million per year. He led the Cougars to a 6-6 record, and shortly after announced he was leaving for his dream job as head coach at Iowa State.
Prior to Rogers, Jake Dickert spent just over three years leading the Cougars, making about $2.5 million per year, before jumping ship last year for Wake Forest.
Dickert’s predecessor, Nick Rolovich, was hired in 2020 to replace the legendary Mike Leach. Rolovich coached during the COVID-shortened 2020 campaign, and was fired early in the 2021 season for refusing the state’s order that he get a COVID vaccination. Rolovich sued the state for $25 million, but lost in federal court.

The last football coach to spend any real time in Pullman was Leach, who was at one time the state’s highest-paid employee at $3 million per year. Leach led the Cougars to six bowl games in eight seasons before leaving after the 2019 season for Mississippi State, part of the powerful SEC. Leach died in 2022.
‘A job that coaches can have success at’
To be sure, the WSU job comes with some disadvantages. Pullman is a town of about 35,000 people located 75 miles south of Spokane in wheat farming country. It is far from the glitz of big cities, and recruiting top athletes there can be a challenge. Now that top players are demanding millions of dollars in “name, image, likeness” money to sign with a team, those difficulties are magnified.
Rogers this week insisted he did not intend to leave Pullman after one season, but could not turn down a job he had wanted for years.
“I didn’t take the Washington State job and move across the country to abandon it in one year. I didn’t,” Rogers said at his introduction Monday at Iowa State. “I took that jump because I believed in that product and what I could produce there.”
Rogers said that he would have liked to coach the Cougars in the Idaho Potato Bowl against Utah State on Dec. 22, but the administration decided an assistant coach would do that instead.
Complicating the problems at Washington State is that Athletic Director Anne McCoy was unceremoniously fired a few weeks ago by Cantwell for not raising enough in donations to the athletic department. 
For all the coaching changes, WSU’s football team has remained pretty good. The Cougars will go to their ninth bowl game in ten years this season, unprecedented success for the program.
“Washington State has proven time and again that it can be a job that coaches can have success at,” broadcaster and former Washington State quarterback Alex Brink said.
Cantwell has said the dramatic changes in the college football world that left Washington State behind require a coach who views name, image, likeness money and the transfer portal as strategic tools, not impediments.
Cantwell has also worked this year to improve the football fan experience in Pullman. That includes funding for a new scoreboard and other upgrades inside 33,000-seat Martin Stadium, in an effort to boost tepid attendance.
“We’ve got alcohol in the stands. We’ve got a whole plethora of things happening right outside the stadium,” Cantwell said. “Keep an eye on us. It’s getting better and better and better every game.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WSU-cougars-football-1024x691.jpg,,,2025-12-13 07:57:01.262305

For more than two decades, Denise Lugo has worked as a home care worker in Fayetteville, North Carolina, caring for elderly clients in their homes.
Workers like Lugo provide intimate care for seniors and people with disabilities who cannot care for themselves. For what’s often grueling work, Lugo makes $15 an hour caring for two clients, juggling everything from light housekeeping to household errands to bathing, dressing and exercising.
But Lugo’s livelihood and that of 3 million home care workers across the country is now in peril under a proposal by the Trump administration to end their rights to federal minimum wage and overtime.
“Without my income from caregiving, I would be in the streets,” Lugo, who organizes with the National Domestic Workers Alliance’s We Dream in Black North Carolina chapter, wrote to the Department of Labor in an official comment on the proposed rule. “What would you do if one of your family members needed a home health aid and you can’t get one because you are not paying us enough?” she asked.
Workers like Lugo have been mobilizing against the Trump administration proposal, which reopens a loophole allowing employers to broadly classify care workers as “companions” who can be paid less than minimum wage and are not eligible for overtime pay. The fight has also energized workers’ efforts to push state and federal lawmakers to strengthen their rights even as federal ones are taken away.

Today, home care work is ubiquitous, with at least 9.8 million older adults and people with disabilities relying on care workers in order to stay out of institutional care. Indeed, home health and personal care work is one of the fastest-growing occupations in the country, projected to add nearly 740,000 workers between 2024 and 2034 — a jump of 17%. But without a federally mandated right to minimum wage and overtime, workers’ wages — and how easily employers can cut them — will vary depending on which state they are in.
“[T]his is going to create a patchwork of [state] laws,” said Anamaria Segura, an attorney at Getman, Sweeney & Dunn, a Kingston, New York-based firm that fights wage theft on behalf of workers nationwide, including home care aides.
At least one-quarter of all home care workers will lose their right to minimum wage and overtime under the Trump administration proposal because they live in states that have no additional wage protections for home care workers. Rights for the rest vary widely. In Pennsylvania, for example, state law guarantees minimum wage and overtime for the 94% of home care workers employed by agencies, but not the 6% directly employed by their client. Meanwhile, home care workers in New York have been entitled to minimum wage since 2010, when the state passed the first state-level Domestic Workers Bill of Rights.
If Lugo’s agency decides to classify her as a companion, it could legally pay her even less than the state minimum wage, which matches the federal rate of $7.25 an hour. She’ll be left with two options: take the lower wage — or quit.
The change, part of a suite of 63 deregulatory actions by the U.S. Department of Labor, is already effectively being implemented, said Mimi Whittaker, a legal fellow at the National Employment Law Project. Rulemaking is still in process, but leadership at the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division instructed staff in July to immediately refrain from investigating home care agencies that had been charged with misclassifying workers as companions, and to drop any cases currently being considered.
The agency is “currently reviewing and considering the more than 5,500 comments received in the department’s proposal,” a Labor Department official said in an email.

Home care employers, particularly for-profit agencies, often exploited a “companionship” loophole that existed from 1974 to 2015, said Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. In 1974, the Labor Department extended wage and overtime protections to care workers unless they were “companions.” In 2013, regulators restricted the companionship definition and closed the loophole as of 2015.
Prior to the 1974 change, care workers had no rights to minimum wage or overtime pay, because Congress had excluded jobs primarily held by Black workers from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Today, the field is 84% female and 67% nonwhite.
The move to reopen the companionship loophole was “a handout to big corporations, the home care agencies, [which are a] powerful industry [with] a lot of private equity investment,” said Whittaker. The majority of home care agencies are for-profit, and an increasing share of them are run by private equity groups.
The Home Care Association of America, an industry group, “lobbied DOL extensively” for the rule change, according to an August newsletter for the roughly 3,500 home care agencies in its membership.
The association also provided members with a comment template that said the 2013 rule extending labor protections to home care workers “limited access to affordable home care by increasing costs and administrative burdens for home care agencies.”
The Home Care Association of America did not respond to requests for comment.
Home care industry experts expect the rule to be finalized soon. In September, before the government shutdown, attorney Angelo Spinola with the Polsinelli Law Firm told home care and hospice agencies that his “best guess” was that the rule would become effective in January.
Home care workers have pushed back against the proposed rule, the latest battle in a long fight to improve working conditions.
As soon as public comments opened for the July proposal, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, a worker advocacy group, coordinated 2,206 public comments from members and allies. The group also pushed to extend the comment period. On Aug. 25, the agency declined that request. The comment period closed on Sept. 2, with more than 5,500 comments submitted.
In a Sept. 2 letter to the labor secretary, Rep. Pramila Jayapal and more than 100 other Democratic representatives argued that the proposal would “jeopardize our nation’s care economy [and] destabilize an already underpaid workforce.”
Labor officials and attorneys general in Democratic-controlled states have also weighed in with comments, arguing that the proposal would put a greater burden on states to police wage theft.
The proposal has also energized existing fights for stronger federal and state protections.
At the federal level, 114 Democratic representatives have co-sponsored a National Domestic Worker Bill of Rights introduced by Rep. Jayapal in June. The legislation would guarantee care workers’ minimum wage, overtime and anti-discrimination protections through amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs wages and overtime, and the Civil Rights Act. Every House Republican and 98 Democrats have so far declined to co-sponsor.
Even if the bill doesn’t advance, said Whittaker, the effort can help build momentum in campaigns to expand state labor protections. That effort is further along in some states than others. Currently, about half of U.S. states have protections that at least partially close the loophole, although details vary widely.
In September, after a lobbying push by California’s United Domestic Workers and other caregivers, California passed a bill codifying home care workers’ overtime protections into state law. (Disclosure: UDW is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)
Meanwhile, existing home care workers’ fights have taken on new urgency, whether with unions or worker centers.
In Washington State, home care workers with Service Employees International Union 775 advocated for a successful ballot resolution this election that backers say will increase funding for long-term care and, therefore, job security for care workers. (Disclosure: SEIU is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.) In Illinois, home care workers with SEIU Healthcare Illinois have demanded progressive taxation to fund senior home care threatened by Medicaid cuts in the Republican-backed federal tax law. In Michigan, 32,000 home care workers unionized with SEIU Healthcare Michigan this past October. And in Pennsylvania, home care workers with SEIU helped push the state legislature to pass a 2026 budget in November that includes $21 million to raise wages for care workers hired directly by their clients — the same workers left without protections thanks to the federal loophole.
And in Georgia, workers with that state’s We Dream in Black chapter have advocated for a bill requiring Medicaid-funded home care agencies to share data on wages, benefits, vacancies, and workforce demographics.

Angela Engram, a home care worker in Pittsburgh, worries the change could put an end to overtime pay she needs.
Engram works more than 60 hours per week caring for an elderly client who hires her directly. For doing “everything” for the woman she cares for, Engram said — grocery shopping, housekeeping, helping her get dressed, coordinating doctor visits and showing up at night if something is wrong — she makes $13.53 per hour. Thanks to overtime protections, she usually earns around $20.30 for every hour above 40 each week.
“I basically live off my overtime pay,” she said. But if she’s classified as a companion rather than a worker, she could lose it.
“I wouldn’t be able to eat without it, pay my bills without it,” Engram said. Her husband is disabled and unable to work. She gets health insurance through a subsidized plan on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. In October, she started requesting 90-day prescriptions, expecting that they will become unaffordable if Congress allows the subsidies to expire.
“Without the overtime, my goodness, there’s no way I can live off of $13.53 an hour,” Engram said. “I’m barely doing it now.

Back then, I worked nights […]","Workers at the Magnitude 7 Metals plant in Marston, which announced it was closing in 2024 (photo submitted). When I fire up the tractor before sunrise in Campbell, the hum of the engine takes me back to a different kind of power — the kind that used to surge through the aluminum cells at Magnitude 7 Metals in Marston before it closed its doors almost two years ago.
Back then, I worked nights surrounded by sparks and heat, helping turn raw ore into the lightweight metal that keeps America running. These days, I work the same Bootheel land at my neighbors farm, but the story hasn’t changed much: whether you’re smelting or farming, you’re fighting the same battle for affordable energy, steady pay and a future worth passing on.
When the Magnitude 7 Metals smelter closed nearly two years ago for the second time, hundreds of good-paying union jobs vanished overnight. Those were jobs that kept local diners open, hardware stores busy, and families rooted in this corner of Missouri.
I thought tariffs would keep us safe — after all, that’s what we were told in 2018 when President Donald Trump imposed Section 232 tariffs to bring our industry back from the brink. For a while, it felt like that might happen. The former Noranda plant restarted. Paychecks flowed back into our towns. But without addressing the root problem — sky-high electricity costs driven by our reliance on the aging New Madrid coal plant — tariffs, though helpful, are only a temporary patch.
Without investment in affordable, reliable power, tariffs won’t cut it. That’s why the gates at Magnitude 7 are still closed today.
The truth is, Missouri’s economy runs on the same current: whether you’re melting metal or tending crops, you need dependable electricity at a fair price. Down here in the Bootheel, farmers are struggling with the same energy problem that sank the smelter. High power costs drive up grain drying bills, squeeze irrigation budgets, and eat away at razor-thin margins. And most of that power still comes from the New Madrid coal plant, a costly system that’s left both industry and agriculture in a tough spot.
We’ve got what it takes to fix this. Missouri is rich in natural and human resources: flat land, steady wind, strong sun, and hardworking people ready to make a living. If we invested in renewable energy right here — from solar arrays outside Sikeston to wind projects across the state — we could lower costs, strengthen the grid, and give towns like Marston and Campbell a second chance.
Coal is still essential in the short term, since we lack the infrastructure to switch fully to renewables right away, but the transition has to start somewhere and coal won’t be around forever. Cleaner, cheaper power could help farms grow and maybe even bring primary aluminum production back to life.
America still needs aluminum, and it’ll need a lot more of it in the coming years. Every tractor, truck, and transmission line depends on it. And Missouri can play a bigger role in meeting that need, not by relying on quick political fixes like tariffs, but by giving workers and farmers the tools to compete with cleaner, more efficient energy.
Across America, data centers are booming, and billions in new investments are being proposed right here in Missouri. But for all that growth, these massive facilities won’t create anywhere near the number of steady jobs a smelter once did. What they will do is compete for the same limited supply of electricity — driving up demand and making it even harder for industries like aluminum and agriculture to afford the power they need to survive
Let’s stop pretending tariffs will rebuild our economy. The people who power Missouri — on the factory floor and in the fields — know what we really need: investment in affordable, modern energy that lets us work hard, earn fair, and stay rooted right here at home.
It’s been almost two years since the smelter closed, but I still think of the job and people I worked with every day. Every time I do, I think about how connected our struggles are in this part of the state. The lesson is clear: if we want to rebuild Southeast Missouri, we have to invest in energy that works for everyone — from the aluminum cell to the plow.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/smelter-1024x587.png,,,2025-12-13 06:56:20.327469

(MoMo Productions/DigitalVision via Getty Images)It’s a rare occasion when my worlds of biomedical informatics and serialized lesbian melodrama fandom collide.
But that’s exactly what happened earlier this summer when two of my favorite actresses appeared on a popular podcast. I was excited to hear them talk about their new book and their history of working together, so I was confused but delighted when their conversation took a turn toward my area of expertise — electronic health records.
One actress noted that on a recent trip to the optometrist, she was asked about her ethnicity. “And I was like, what difference does it make?” she said.
The host chimed in with her experience of being asked similarly personal questions before a mammogram. “Like, it doesn’t matter if I’m married or not. It doesn’t matter if I’m white or Asian, you know?” she remarked.
Listening to the host and actresses question a process that, to me, seems straightforward and purposeful served as a stark reminder of the chasm that often exists between how researchers like me use patient data and a patient’s actual experience of clinical data collection.
For those of us who use demographic data collected during health care encounters to conduct research and design interventions, it does matter whether patients answer their doctor’s demographic questions. But as a patient myself, I can see how these questions might seem unnecessary and even invasive.
So it may help to understand why your doctors collect this data, how researchers use it and what medical discoveries might be possible when we know more about who patients are.
 
Why your data matters
When you answer the demographic questions your doctor logs in your electronic health record, you’re doing more than disclosing personal information. You’re adding one small piece to a giant puzzle of data that allows researchers like me to see a bigger picture.
Your health information can help us understand who gets sick and why. It might even be used to design real health interventions.
As a researcher focused on improving health and health care for moms and their babies, I consider myself lucky to live in Indiana, a state with one of the nation’s most comprehensive health information exchanges. These exchanges are interconnected networks of hospital system electronic health record databases from all over the state that allow researchers like me to learn about how individuals and groups experience health and medical care.
For example, my colleagues and I in the Indiana University Better AI for a Strong Rural Maternal and Child Health Environment Lab use this data to train machine learning models that predict preeclampsia, a life-threatening condition of high blood pressure during pregnancy, before a mom gets really sick.
We could use only clinical data: diagnoses, labs and vital readings like blood pressure that contribute to the outcome of preeclampsia. But for conditions like preeclampsia, Black moms are diagnosed at higher rates than their white counterparts. Research shows that race and racism can be major contributing factors to this disparity.
In order to predict preeclampsia accurately and use these predictions to help doctors monitor, diagnose and treat the condition, my team needs to factor in other information that can illuminate these different outcomes, called social determinants of health.
Social determinants of health are the parts of ourselves and our environments that drive our health status. Race itself isn’t a social determinant of health, but racism is. This includes structural racism, like a ZIP code’s history of school segregation or redlining. If available, we also include information you might have given at your doctor’s visit, like if you haven’t had enough food to eat in the past month, or if you have a history of intimate partner violence or homelessness.
Because there is more variation within races than between them, race alone actually tells us very little. Including social determinants of health in our datasets provides added context as to how you move about the world, what resources you have access to and how your environment might shape your health.
 
Putting the pieces together

This is why your cardiologist asks about your marital status. Your response might help researchers understand why single moms are more likely to have cardiovascular disease than their married counterparts. And telling your optometrist your race is one of the only ways to learn what role race might play in patients using weight loss drugs experiencing vision loss.
Other researchers have used data from electronic records to determine how many people in a geographic area or of a certain demographic group have diabetes, to predict dementia and even to track gum disease.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers used data from electronic health records to determine what types of people were getting sick. They investigated COVID-19 patients’ race, geography and insurance status. Researchers continue to use this data to track long COVID, a condition that health professionals still don’t completely understand.
 
Honoring patient privacy
Of course, these health information exchanges are careful about how and with whom they share patient data. The data is tailored to the needs of the study and shared in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.
For instance, for my most recent preeclampsia study, the health care system sent a dataset that contained limited pieces of personal information, like the baby’s birth date, the mom’s birth date — since we often need to know how old she was when she gave birth — and their ZIP code so we can see trends in preeclampsia across geographic areas.
The data wasn’t allowed out of the health system’s virtual private network, so the data remains within our firewall. This ensures that the data remains safe. And all of this must be approved by our university’s institutional review board, a rigorous process that ensures our research can’t harm participants.
 
Improving health care for everyone — including you
All of this research drives innovation and serves as a basis for the programs, protocols and policies that improve health — from you as an individual all the way to the national and even global level.
Your doctor can use the information you provide to recommend services or therapies for you. For instance, if your doctor finds out through check-in questioning that you haven’t had enough food in the past month, they can refer you to a nutrition program, sometimes run by the hospital system itself. If you were married at your last appointment but now list your marital status as “separated,” your doctor can check in with you to see if you need any additional mental health or social services.
While it’s normal for these personal questions to feel a little uncomfortable, it helps to remember that there is a good reason your doctor is asking them. Your data can help move medical research forward.

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s revenue outlook for the coming fiscal year improved slightly in recent months, but nowhere near enough to stave off the “hard choices” lawmakers will face in the 2026 legislative session when they are dealing with a $1.5 billion budget shortfall.
State analysts told the Board of Revenue Estimates Friday that projected general fund revenues for fiscal 2027 inched up from $27.102 billion in September’s estimates to $27.111 billion in December — an increase of just $9.1 million
Board of Revenue Estimates Executive Secretary Robert Rehrmann said the updated forecast remains in line with September projections “despite the headwinds we face in Washington, D.C., … federal cutbacks, and also this general uncertainty about the economy.” He described the December update as “a kind of recalibration” of the state’s major revenue sources.
The new projection includes a modest increase in personal income taxes. Half of that is from capital gains, a volatile and difficult-to-project revenue stream. That increase is offset by reductions in sales and corporate income taxes.

The result is a $45 million increase for the current fiscal year and less than $10 million for the coming year.
Rehrmann warned of continued economic uncertainty including federal cutbacks — the extent of which will likely remain unknown until the next estimate in March — as well as signs of economic slowing that could be a possible recession.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D), who chairs the three-member board, called the forecast “positive news” but cautioned the revenue numbers “don’t tell the whole story of how our economy is functioning, and can obscure the realities that some of our friends and neighbors are facing as they struggle to afford basic necessities.”
“Maryland is certainly currently meeting its revenue expectations, but it’s important to acknowledge that those expectations, as I mentioned, were lowered due in part to challenges created by our own federal government,” she said.
Lierman noted that Maryland’s median annual income — more than $102,000 — stands “well above” the national average at the same time that nearly 40% of state residents are considered unable to afford basic necessities.
“These are families that are earning above the poverty line but still unable to afford essentials like housing, food, child care and health care,” Lierman said.
Credit card debt is higher in Maryland than the national average. Restaurants without beer and wine licenses are seeing declines, and supermarkets are reporting reduced sales of taxable goods, such as prepared meals.
The result is what Lierman called a K-shaped economy, where higher-income families do well and those on the margins struggle.
“Our general fund revenues remain steady, buoyed in part … by capital gains, and these trends reflect the reality of the K-shaped economy in Maryland,” Lierman said. “But instability among middle-income families will eventually impact our broader revenue stream — sales and use taxes, withholding revenue and other sources — that support our budget, because the K-shaped economy is simply not sustainable for our economy or society, and the work of government must reflect the lived experiences of Marylanders, not just our balance sheets.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lawmakers return to Annapolis on Jan. 14 for a 2026 General Assembly with a very different budget outlook than the one they imagined at the end of the last session in April. Instead of the $300 million surplus forecast then, lawmakers will to close a $1.5 billion structural budget gap.
In a speech Thursday evening to the Maryland Association of Counties winter meeting in Cambridge, Gov. Wes Moore (D) took tax increases off the table for fiscal 2027. Acting state Budget Secretary Yaakov “Jake” Weissmann, a member of the revenue board, said Friday that means “the choices in front of us are difficult.”
House Majority Leader Del. David Moon (D-Montgomery), speaking Friday morning at the MACo conference, also said tax increases are unlikely in the upcoming session, the last session before the 2026 elections.
Moon and others have also said using the state’s rainy day fund could damage the state’s bond rating, making it more expensive for the state to borrow money.
“The bond rating agencies are breathing down our shoulders, threatening to raise our borrowing costs,” Moon said. “I would think we can’t be raiding rainy day funds and the like.”
But Treasurer Dereck Davis, the third member of the revenue board, said during the afternoon meeting that those rating agencies have little to worry about.
“Of course, the bills will be consistently paid,” Davis said. “So, for those from Wall Street who are worried about that, don’t. The bills will be paid, and they will be paid on time.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_6425-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-12-13 00:56:56.180001

Doug Jones kicked off his 2026 gubernatorial campaign Friday, mixing promises to protect health care and voting rights with attacks on likely GOP gubernatorial nominee Tommy Tuberville.
Speaking to more than 1,000 people on the eighth anniversary of his victory in the 2017 special U.S. Senate election, Jones, referencing a song by the country group The Highwomen, said he wanted to make Alabama a “crowded table” where everybody is welcome.
“It’s a powerful song about community, bringing people together despite their differences,” Jones said. “It is much like our victory in 2017, an anthem about finding strength in unity and ensuring that everyone has a place at the table and a sense of belonging. That, folks, is my vision for Alabama.”

Campaign promises

In a 45-minute speech, Jones pledged to invest in mental health to improve the state’s prison system; make it easier to vote and to protect in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and contraception.
“Make no mistake, folks, the people that work to try to control Montgomery every day, that’s what they’re coming for next,” Jones said. “It started with abortion, but they’re coming for IVF, and they’re coming for contraception.”
Jones’ reproductive health campaign promises stem from a greater promise to expand Medicaid, which he said is the backbone of the health care system. 
Jones attacked Tuberville over his support of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and vote against extending tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, the loss of which could cause 130,000 Alabamians to lose health insurance. Jones also brought up questions of Tuberville’s residency in the state, which have dogged the senator for years. 
“Tuberville with this Donald Trump first and Alabama afterthought mindset, his blind support of what I call the anything but beautiful bill. Tuberville has been slamming the door on Medicaid expansion,” Jones said. “He doesn’t care about the health of Alabama families. He just cares more about what’s going on on the beach down to Santa Rosa.”
A message seeking comment from Tuberville’s campaign was left Friday afternoon.
If elected, Jones said he would expand Medicaid with an executive order if the Legislature does not do so. 
“We’re going to do everything in our power, everything to get health care to every Alabamian,” he said. “If that means expanding Medicaid with a stroke of the governor’s pen, I am damn sure going to do it.”
The governor can expand Medicaid by order, but the Legislature would have to approve funding for it. 
Jones also invoked his work as U.S. attorney, where he secured convictions against Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. in 2001 and Bobby Frank Cherry in 2002 for the murder of four little girls in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963. Both men were sentenced to life in prison.
Jones criticized the state’s overcrowded prisons, saying some incarcerated people need mental health care instead.
“We talk a good game about mental health, but then we just warehouse folks in prison,” he said.
He also vowed to end straight ticket voting and to advocate for early voting. Democrats in the Legislature have tried for years to pass an early voting law, but are denied due to Republican critiques of voter fraud and operating costs. 
“What do you think they’re scared of? Are they scared that the wrong people are going to vote?” Jones asked the crowd. “Probably so, because that’s why they would rather suppress those votes rather than compete for those votes.”
Jones critiqued the state’s straight ticket voting system. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the method allows voters to choose a party’s entire slate of candidates with a single ballot mark. Alabama is one of five states that uses the voting system.
“We have got to stop clinging to an antiquated, rigged system of outdated, straight ticket voting,” he said. “Straight ticket voting, which we know is nothing more than a rigged system to keep powerful people in power, even as they fail us every dang year.”

A lively crowd

Jones was preceded by DJ Slim Robb who energized the crowd with songs like “Bad to the Bone” by George Thorogood, “24K Magic” by Bruno Mars and “Sweet Home Alabama” by Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Singer-songwriter Jason Isbell, an Alabama native, played a three-song set before introducing Jones’ wife Louise as “the most important person” on the campaign. 
“I think if everybody who was running for this office was a good, honest person, I think Doug would still be a great candidate,” Isbell said.
Louise teased her husband on their 33rd wedding anniversary and his listening skills that she said he only puts to use at work.
“Even when the issues are hard and the stakes are high, he’s always believed that our state is strongest when every community has a voice,” she said. “Leaders put people ahead of politics.”
Three young supporters also spoke, saying they felt hopeful with Jones’ candidacy. Robert Gaines, Jr., a freshman at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that even when he was a child when Jones won the Senate seat in 2017, he could tell something important was happening.
“It means hope for greater transparency so the public is not left in the dark. It means hope for a real seat at the table for people like me. It means hope for me and my peers, who are often spoken about but not represented,” Gaines said of why he supports Jones.
Gaines’ mother, Marilyn Yelder, said in an interview after the event that Jones’ platform applies to her family. She said Gaines has Type 1 Diabetes and will soon lose their current health care coverage. 
“When it comes to Medicaid expansion, he will eventually age out of some of these benefits, which could leave us uninsured within the next year,” Yelder said. “This time next year, if something does not change, my son may not even be able to afford necessary medications that are needed to keep him alive.”
Caleb Rotton, a 37-year-old Homewood resident and longtime Jones supporter, said he was proud of Alabama representation for the first time when Jones was in the Senate and feels inspired again.
“I was just proud, for once, for one of our politicians to serve the people instead of themselves,” Rotten said in an interview.

An uphill battle
Democrats face a tough battle for statewide office in Alabama. Jones, who was the first Democrat to win election to the U.S. Senate in 25 years, is the only Democrat to win a statewide vote for a political office since 2008, when former Public Service Commission President Lucy Baxley narrowly won election to the PSC. The last Democrat to win the governor’s mansion was Don Siegelman in 1998. Siegelman served a single term.
Tuberville defeated Jones for U.S. Senate in 2020 despite Jones outspending Tuberville 3-to-1.
Rotton acknowledged the uphill battle for any Democrat in Alabama, but believes that Jones can appeal to voters who may not be enthusiastic about voting for Tuberville.
“I think Doug can appeal to that voter, which is, in my mind, the only way that I think a Democrat could probably win in the state,” Rotton said.
Rep. Philip Ensler, D-Montgomery, attended the event and said in an interview he felt the excitement in the room and for himself.
“Look, people are energized. As he said, it’s bigger than Democrat or Republican,” Ensler said. “Whatever people’s political background, I think they really are feeling frustrated with the status quo. They want something that’s going to be forward thinking. And I’m excited.”
Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Montgomery, also attended the event.
“Doug and I go way back. We’ve known each other for a long time. I support Doug,” Singleton said in an interview.

Primary landscape

Jones joins Will Boyd and Chad “Chig” Martin in the Democratic primary, which is on May 19. Throughout the event, Jones focused more on the general election in November. However, Jones said in an interview after the event that he is going to run an aggressive campaign in the primary and the general.
“I want people to compare my record of service to the people of Alabama, to all sections of the people of Alabama, versus the service that may or may not exist with my opponents,” Jones said.
Martin is a first time candidate and Boyd has run for several state offices but has not won. In an interview Friday afternoon, Martin said having Jones in the race is good for voters.
“The more competition the better. I think that’s better for the citizens in Alabama,” Martin said.
A message seeking comment from Boyd was left Friday afternoon.
“On that election day in 2017 we gave the people, not just in Alabama, but across this country, something even more significant. We gave them hope for a stronger democracy,” Jones said. “And today, eight years later, we’re rekindling that hope, that optimism, that enthusiasm. Let’s face it, there is a greater urgency for hope today than there was in 2017.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0848-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 23:56:39.160535

(Screenshot)Aaron Christian Peterson is one step closer to becoming Alaska’s next federal judge.
In a party-line vote on Thursday, the U.S. Senate’s judiciary committee voted 14-8 to advance Peterson’s nomination to a vote of the full U.S. Senate.
Unlike Alaska, where prospective state judges are nominated by a nonpartisan panel based on merit, federal judges are nominated by the president and subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate in a heavily politicized process.
Because the U.S. Senate is controlled by a Republican majority, Peterson’s confirmation process is not expected to be significantly contested.
Peterson, selected by President Donald Trump in October after being vetted by U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was among seven prospective judges and federal prosecutors considered by the committee on Thursday.
Peterson is a former attorney with the Alaska Department of Law’s natural resource division and has served as a prosecutor. He is a U.S. Air Force veteran, registered Republican and a member of the Federalist Society, whose members generally follow Republican legal principles and support President Donald Trump..
Much of the discussion in the committee hearing focused on other nominees; Peterson was rarely mentioned and did not face any particular opposition, similar to his uneventful confirmation hearing last month. 
Alaska has three federal judgeships; two are currently vacant. One of those vacancies was caused in 2024 when former judge Joshua Kindred resigned amid a sex-and-misconduct scandal after being appointed during Trump’s first term. 
No one has yet been nominated for Alaska’s other vacant judgeship.
Speaking generally, the judiciary committee chair, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on Thursday, “I’d like to process even more judicial nominations, but I’m waiting on the president to get those nominations up here.”
Peterson’s final confirmation vote is expected before the end of the year.

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan joined Senate Democrats and a handful of other Republicans on Thursday in voting to extend federal subsidies that would have prevented a major spike in health care prices at the end of the year.
Sixty votes were needed to advance a bill containing the extension, but the vote failed 51-48. An alternative Republican-backed bill, which would have offered marginal help to offset the cost increases, also failed despite support from Murkowski and Sullivan.
Barring additional action before Jan. 1, thousands of Alaskans and millions of Americans who buy health insurance through the federal marketplace will pay significantly more for health care next year.
“I would just suggest that we have failed,” Murkowski said in a floor speech following the votes.
Sullivan, in a written statement, said in part that “there is little doubt that a lot of hard-working Alaskans, families, entrepreneurs and small business owners will be negatively impacted if these enhanced premium tax credits expire.”
Both Murkowski and Sullivan said they would continue working to try to find a compromise before the end of the year.
The failed Democratic proposal would have offered a flat three-year extension of subsidies that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency and extended during the Biden administration.
Most Republican senators opposed a flat extension and emphasized instances of fraud and abuse, saying that further changes were needed to the program. 
Even with those changes, the Republican-backed proposal offered only a small cash payment and didn’t extend the subsidies; many Americans and Alaskans would still face large cost increases.
“Now that both the Republican and Democrat proposals failed to advance, I will redouble my efforts to develop a compromise solution. In the longer-term, we need to focus on getting federal government health care dollars out of the hands of insurance companies and into the hands of the people,” Sullivan said in his statement.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-11.07.51 AM-1024x602.png,,,2025-12-12 20:56:36.966618

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Ethics Commission member Murray Sagsveen has withdrawn his application for another term after a selection committee deadlocked over his reappointment. 
Sagsveen withdrew in a Thursday letter to Gov. Kelly Armstrong, obtained by the North Dakota Monitor. However, Sagsveen says he’ll continue serving until his seat is filled.
Armstrong, part of a three-person Ethics Commission Selection Committee, had refused to reappoint Sagsveen. The other two committee members, the Senate majority and minority leaders, want Sagsveen to remain on the commission. The positions are required to be filled by a unanimous consensus, leading to a stalemate.
“It has dragged on for several months and it’s in the best interest of the Ethics Commission that a person be appointed for a full four-year term,” Sagsveen said in an interview Friday. “It was obvious to me that it was an impasse.”
Ethics commissioner does not have the support to keep serving, governor argues

The governor sent Sagsveen a letter on Nov. 19 that did not directly ask Sagsveen to resign, but said his service “is no longer necessary” because the Ethics Commission now has enough members to operate without him. Armstrong told Sagsveen he no longer has “consensus to continue serving past your expired term.”
Sagsveen’s term ended Aug. 31 but he has continued to serve while the commission had three vacancies.
Sagsveen requested an opinion from the Ethics Commission’s general counsel, Logan Carpenter, on whether it was legal to continue serving until he is reappointed or a successor was named. Carpenter concluded it was. 
“I was following the guidance of the Ethics Commission’s general counsel,” Sagsveen said. “However, after September, October, November and into December, with no resolution and it appeared there would not be a resolution, that’s when I decided to withdraw my application.”
He said he is hopeful ongoing conflicts between the Ethics Commission and the executive branch can be solved through better communication between the various stakeholders. 
“There should be continuing dialogue among everyone,” Sagsveen said. “The legislative branch, executive branch, the governor, the attorney general.”
Armstrong has said the Ethics Commission needs a “general reset.” Armstrong said he strongly disagrees with a response Sagsveen gave during the selection process in which Sagsveen said the North Dakota Legislature has passed laws to limit the commission’s authority, in violation of the state constitution. The governor also has said a recent Ethics Commission advisory opinion encroached on the authority of the legislative and executive branches. 
Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney with extensive government experience, notes in his letter that his public service to North Dakota began in January 1973. He was appointed to the Ethics Commission in September 2024 to fill the remainder of a term for a member who retired. 
The legislative leaders supported Sagsveen to promote continuity on the commission, with Senate Majority Leader David Hogue identifying Sagsveen as his “top pick.”
The Ethics Commission Selection Committee has one vacancy left to fill and is set to meet Tuesday afternoon. The next meeting of the Ethics Commission is Wednesday.
The committee also recently appointed former Office of Management and Budget Director Pam Sharp and Fargo attorney Mark Western to positions on the Ethics Commission.

(Photo: Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources)State officials are offering no explanation for why Nevada State Engineer Adam Sullivan, who was appointed as the state’s top water regulator in 2021, is suddenly leaving his role at the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR).
Sullivan, who also served as administrator of the Department’s Division of Water Resources, was responsible for managing Nevada’s limited water resources as the state engineer, including settling disputes over water claims and issuing permits for housing developments.
Former deputy administrator Chris Thorson will serve as the new acting administrator for the Division of Water Resources, according to a spokesperson for the DCNR.
Spokesperson Jenny Jackson did not provide further details about the reason for Sullivan’s departure or clarify when exactly Sullivan left his role.
“The Department is now focused on strengthening Nevada’s water management and ensuring a smooth leadership transition,” Jackson said.
Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office did not respond to a request for comment Friday. 
Sullivan was named Acting State Engineer in November 2020 under former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, when the previous state engineer, Tim Wilson, retired after 25 years of state service.
Sullivan has worked on water policy in Nevada for more than 20 years and served various roles within the Division of Water Resources since 2009.
He played a pivotal role in a Nevada Supreme Court case last year that affirmed the state’s right to manage interconnected sources of water as a single source in order to protect senior water rights and wildlife.
The consequential Nevada Supreme Court case – Sullivan v. Lincoln County – determined the state engineer had the statutory authority to merge multiple water basins into one superbasin, a decision that will likely have a profound impact on the way groundwater is managed in the state going forward.
Sullivan said the case would have sweeping ramifications for Nevada, but that full implementation of the ruling may take some time.
Lawmakers expressed concern about the implications of the case on the state economy. Last year, state lawmakers introduced Assembly Bill 387, a bill that would have clarified the state’s authority to deny water permits based on the potential for conflict between surface water rights and groundwater rights. 
But large water users — including real estate developers and mining companies — pushed back on the bill, arguing the state was attempting to exceed its authority and curtail water rights.
The Nevada Supreme Court ruling essentially does the same thing the bill would have accomplished, Sullivan told lawmakers in the months following the ruling. 
The new state engineer will have to face a slew of water rights issues beyond the Supreme Court ruling, including increasing demand for limited water resources as Nevada’s population rapidly grows and prolonged drought exacerbated by the impacts of climate change.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NVDCNwater-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-12-12 19:57:49.401122

(Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)“Despite our simple requests for information on how they’re going to keep this data secure, they’ve given us no clear answers,” Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar said in a statement Friday after the U.S. Department of Justice announced it was suing the state — the latest push in the Trump administration’s efforts to examine Nevadans’ private voter data at will.
“While these requests may seem like normal oversight, the federal government is using its power to try to intimidate states and influence how states administer elections ahead of the 2026 cycle,” Aguilar said.
“It’s my duty to follow Nevada law and protect the best interests of Nevadans, which includes protecting their sensitive information and access to the ballot,” Aguilar said, adding “the Constitution makes it clear: elections are run by the states.” 
The DOJ announced Friday that it was suing Nevada, along with Colorado, Hawaii, and Massachusetts, bringing the total number of states the administration has sued to obtain voter data to 18.
Trump’s Department of Justice has been pestering Nevada and several other states over much of the year seeking unfettered access to private information about voters, including drivers’ license numbers, addresses, and the last four digits of Social Security numbers.
In March, Trump issued an executive order requiring states to turn over their voter rolls to the Department of Justice, ostensibly in an effort to expose those registered in multiple states. 
In July, responding to a DOJ letter, Nevada provided a version of its statewide voter registration list that is generally available to the public. In August, the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division again requested full access to Nevada’s complete statewide voter registration list, including sensitive personal information.
In August, Nevada responded that it would conduct an analysis of the legal authority for the government’s request. In September, Aguilar refused to share the complete voter registration list, contending the DOJ request was unjustified. 
In November, federal officials acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter information with the Department of Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens as a way to “scrub aliens from voter rolls.”
Later in the month, Aguilar joined a group of Democratic secretaries of state sending a letter to the DOJ saying they were concerned the administration misled them about how it would use voter data collected from their states, and seeking clarification of the DOJ’s motives.
Aguilar said his office hadn’t been served the suit as of Friday, adding his office and that of the Nevada attorney general “are working together to evaluate this litigation from the federal government.”
The Trump administration’s “full access to unredacted voter data will not only violate privacy laws”, said All Voting is Local Nevada State Director Kerry Durmick in a statement Friday. It would also “enable large-scale voter challenges, false claims of fraud, and new attempts to impose proof-of-citizenship and other burdensome requirements that could disenfranchise millions of eligible voters nationwide, including hundreds of thousands of Nevadans.”
“These tactics have long been used to suppress participation, particularly among communities of color, students, and working-class voters, Durmick said. “This lawsuit is an obvious weaponization of our institutions against everyday Americans, and Nevadans will not stand for it.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Voting_053024rc_014-1024x697.jpg,,,2025-12-12 19:57:49.401122

(Photo by jackyenjoy photography/Getty Stock Image)Transportation options impact our everyday life. They affect how we plan our day, what time we leave our homes, what time we’ll be back and how much time we have for other things. What we often overlook is how transportation infrastructure, and the way our communities are designed, impacts our health (both physical and mental).
Although many Marylanders rely on our highway system to get around, the way we traditionally plan highway projects comes with many externalities – indirect costs not accounted for when budgeting the project – such as more pollution, increased vehicle crashes and lack of affordable mobility choices.
Vehicles are a major contributor to ozone pollution and the largest source of carbon emissions, which in turn fuels climate change. Additionally, dust from brake pads and tires releases particulate matter pollution (including soot). Air pollution triggers asthma symptoms, diminishes lung function, triggers heart attacks, causes adverse birth outcomes and increases the risk of cancer as well as premature death.
I’ve seen firsthand how this impacts urban communities like Baltimore City, where my daughter grew up and had to frequently carry an inhaler with her. In several places I’ve lived and worked in the city, it was common to see a layer of black dust on furniture due to particles in the air.

Visits to emergency departments for asthma are much higher in locations that are in violation of federal air quality standards for ozone, including Baltimore City and Baltimore County. Additionally these emergency department visits for asthma are much more frequent — nearly five times higher — among Black children aged 2-17 years compared to white children. When we build projects intended to increase driving, we often fail to account for the costs of dealing with these health impacts, especially for communities located near highways.
Not only does how we design highway projects impact our health, it also impacts our safety.
Last year there were 571 people, including 159 pedestrians or cyclists, who were tragically killed in a car crash in Maryland. Encouraging more driving and car-dependent infrastructure increases the risk of such crashes. When a four-lane highway becomes a six-lane highway, a pedestrian has to cross a wider distance with more cars, more noise and more car exhaust.
Luckily, policies like the Transportation and Climate Alignment Act (TCA) that will be introduced again next year by Del. Mark Edelson (D-Baltimore City) and Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County) can help combat these issues. The Transportation and Climate Alignment would require that Maryland mitigate the harmful pollution from new highway expansion projects by investing in transit, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure as part of the project itself, or prioritize these investments in the area where the project is located.
Spending time in Bruges, Belgium, I recently got to see firsthand what a car-free downtown looks like – vibrant with people walking and biking everywhere. My daughter and I took a city shuttle, a train, the subway, bikes and a bus, only opting for cars (which were electric) twice.
If we focus on helping people get to destinations safely and conveniently rather than cars moving as quickly as possible, then we can start to solve the real problem – whether that is a jobs-to-housing imbalance or lack of amenities (grocery stores, parks, health care, etc.) near where people live.
All communities benefit from infrastructure that helps people walk, bike or take transit. Each Maryland county (including Baltimore City) annually sends a “priority letter” of key projects to fund. Nearly every county has been requesting transit, bike or pedestrian options – whether that is a Southern Maryland Rapid Transit project in Charles County or the implementation of a first fixed-route transit service in Garrett County.
These investments boost our physical and mental health, making it easier to get physical activity and improving access to nature and social activities. They are also good for our pocketbooks given that gas prices and car maintenance cost people thousands of dollars each year. In fact, transportation is the second-largest household cost after the cost of housing in Maryland.
We can plan better and healthier by building infrastructure and policies. Legislation like the Transportation and Climate Alignment Act help steer us in the right direction.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2165387463-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 19:57:49.401122

In June 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged Jodi Lynne Kneisel of Mason City with practicing nursing while under the influence or while impaired by the use of legitimately prescribed drugs; with engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum; and with pleading guilty to, or being convicted of, a crime related to the profession of nursing or a crime would impact the licensee’s ability to practice.
When the board filed the charges against Kneisel, it alleged she was working at a care and rehabilitation center in Mason City during the period when the violations were alleged to have occurred.

However, in the board’s written settlement agreement of the case, the board states that Kneisel, a registered nurse, was working as a travel nurse and was on assignment in Council Bluffs, Cedar Falls and Norfolk, Nebraska, in 2023 when the alleged incidents took place.
According to the settlement agreement, Kneisel had worked three shifts at Methodist Jennie Edmundson Hospital in Council Bluffs in August 2023 before she was fired. On each of her three shifts, she was alleged to have been found sleeping, the board said.
In one instance, Kneisel’s colleagues allegedly had to wake her up after she’d been found sleeping on duty for more than an hour. In another instance, she was allegedly found sleeping in a bed inside a room designated for patients, and later that same shift was found asleep in a hallway.
In December 2024, the board alleges, Kneisel “admitted to having a couple prior to a nursing shift in Norfolk, Nebraska.” The board documents don’t indicate what Kneisel admitted to having consumed.
Also in 2024, the board alleges, Kneisel was accused of being impaired “during a nursing assignment” somewhere in Cedar Falls.
In April 2025, the board alleges, Kneisel pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge in Decatur County and was placed on probation and awarded a deferred judgment in the case.
As a result of the settlement with Kneisel that the board agreed to in November 2025, Kneisel has been issued a warning indicating that engaging in such conduct in the future could lead to sanctions. As part of that same settlement, Kneisel has agreed to enroll in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program for professionals with substance-abuse issues.
The board imposed no restrictions on Kneisel’s ability to practice nursing in Iowa.
Two more arrests this year
Although the board’s settlement agreement makes no mention of it, court records indicate Kneisel was arrested two more times after receiving the deferred judgment on the drunken driving charge.
Court records show the first of those two arrests was on May 8, 2025, when Kneisel was charged by the Osceola Police Department with driving while her license was revoked. Court records indicate Kneisel acknowledged the offense and agreed to a 48-hour jail sentence for contempt of court.
Two weeks after that arrest, on May 23, 2025, Kneisel was arrested in Holt County, Missouri, and charged with driving while revoked, driving while intoxicated and failure to drive on the proper side of the roadway.
Court records show a Holt County officer fielded a report of a driver who was “swerving all over the roadway, almost striking vehicles.”  The officer pulled over the driver, who he identified as Kneisel.
According to a probation officer’s subsequent report of the incident, Kneisel’s blood-alcohol level was above the legal limit, and while en route to jail she admitted to police she had been drinking alcohol for breakfast that morning.
Kneisel’s probation officer has recommended to the court that if the allegations surrounding the May 23 arrest are proven, Kneisel’s probation should be revoked and she should be sentenced to jail.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Jan. 9, 2026.
Court records indicate that as of October 2025, Kneisel was still working as a hospital nurse.

A spokesperson for Verizon said Friday the company plans to fix cell service for East Glacier as soon as weather allows, estimated to be Monday or sooner, after an outage of nearly a week.

The site on top of Mt. Baldy to the south of East Glacier has been impacted due to extreme weather, the spokesperson said.

“The site went off air on Sunday, and we have been attempting to reach the site for repair throughout the week, but the weather conditions have made it unsafe to do so,” said Aimee Knox with Verizon in an email.

Friday, the National Weather Service was forecasting rain, snow and freezing rain, along with wind gusts as high as 29 mph. The chance of precipitation was 70% with 1 to 3 inches of snow possible.

The weekend is forecast to be “breezy,” also with high wind gusts up to 55 mph on Sunday night. However, Monday is expected to be partly sunny, although rain is forecast after 11 a.m. and wind is expected in the afternoon.


“Currently, our only access to the site for repair is via helicopter, and the winds and ice have made it unsafe for the helicopter to fly,” Knox said in an email. “We have the equipment and material in hand to restore service, and we will repair during any break in weather possible, currently targeting Monday. If the weather cooperates, we will accelerate into this weekend, if at all possible.”

Impacted customers are able to connect via WiFi calling and satellite, with satellite-capable devices, according to Verizon.

“911 calls continue to go through as we have back-up measures in place to ensure customers have access to emergency services,” Knox said. “We appreciate your patience as we look to restore service as soon as it is safe to do so.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1309931930-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-12-12 19:57:49.401122

(Daniel Montaño/KUNM)A New Mexico agency’s request to the Legislature for the upcoming legislative session seeks $2.9 million plus funding for additional caseworkers to reduce the high number of mistakes it makes administering a federal food assistance program on which roughly one in five New Mexicans rely.
The funding for more caseworkers and new technology is necessary, officials say, to catch errors the Income Support Division makes in overseeing roughly $1 billion a year in federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. The state’s administration of SNAP is facing renewed scrutiny from Republicans, who recently convinced majority Democrats in the Legislature to approve an audit for fraud in the program. Preliminary results of that audit are expected in January.
But even if the Legislature fully funds the Income Support Division’s request, state officials don’t plan to immediately implement a plan to fix all those mistakes. That’s because the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed in July would effectively penalize the state for doing so, Division Director Niki Kozlowski told Source New Mexico on Friday.
Trump’s signature spending bill contains penalties for states that don’t lower their SNAP “error rates.” That’s a calculation of the number of SNAP over- or underpayments the state makes. New Mexico’s rate is 14.6%, among the nation’s highest. 
Niki Kozlowski, director of the Income Support Division at New Mexico’s Health Care Authority, said Dec. 12, 2025 that she has to perform a “balancing act” to reduce the SNAP error rate significantly, but not before October of 2026. (Courtesy HCA)
Under the law, states with high error rates are required to pay a portion of the total SNAP benefits they receive. That marks a huge change and cost for the program that the federal government usually fully funds. 
Kozlowski’s “first order of business to attack” when she took the helm at ISD in May 2024 was lowering the rate. Heading into 2025, she said she was making steady progress and had identified a number of reforms, putting the agency on track to bring the error rate to under 10% by 2026. 
That’s come to a halt due to a unique provision in the federal spending bill. Any state with an error rate above 13.3% — New Mexico is one of eight — has until Oct. 1, 2026 to lower their rates. But if New Mexico lowers its rate before then to below 13.3% but above 6%, it will no longer qualify for additional time and could face as much as $153 million in penalties.
Kozlowski and her staff refer to the provision as the “Alaska range” based on national reporting that Alaska’s U.S. senators only agreed to support the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” if their state — which has the nation’s highest error rate — received additional time to address the situation. The “Alaska carveout,” as Kozlowski calls it, ended up applying to all the nation’s highest error-rate states, including New Mexico.
“It doesn’t feel, I don’t know, comfortable,” Kozlowski said about the new holding pattern. “It feels like we should still be working on it. So I think my status is that we are still working on it, but we’re taking a more strategic, streamlined approach.”
NM food banks say they will struggle to provide meals for those who lose federal benefits

According to the HCA, about 93% of all the errors are overpayments; the rest are underpayments. Roughly one third of those errors are “agency caused,” like a miscalculation of a benefit or use of outdated client information. The rest are “client caused,” like failing to report a change in household size or income level.
There’s also little room for error in the error rate, Kozlowski said: Incorrect payments are counted even if they’re only a dollar too much or too little.
New Mexico’s high rate error rate, officials say, also results partially from the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the federal government waived client interview requirements, as well as six-month check-ins, during a crush of new applications. Those requirements have been back in effect since October of 2024. 
Caseworkers also largely lack experience, Kozlowski said, and are tasked with determining eligibility for households’ seeking Medicaid, utility assistance and SNAP, among other federal programs, all at once. 
That makes for a complicated process for half of New Mexico’s caseworkers who have been employed at HCA for fewer than three years, Kozlowski said.
Finally, the state has a long-standing practice, at least since the pandemic, of accepting “self-attestation” from households regarding their costs for rent, utilities and childcare, Kozlowski said. All those costs are factored into SNAP and other benefit offers. “Self-attestation” makes for a simpler process, but errors are more likely, Kozlowski said.
Food banks see sharp increase in demand amid federal SNAP uncertainty

So next October, when the Health Care Authority tries to stick the landing of its long-planned “balancing act,” Kozlowski said the biggest error-rate reduction will result from more verification of documents from recipients who “self-attest,” along with technological improvements. 
The division is seeking about $28 million during the upcoming legislative session to hire more caseworkers and pay for a new IT system.
If the Legislature funds it, caseworkers will have access to a much-improved information technology system that assists them in interviews, ensures they check all the right boxes, and monitors the number of mistakes an employee makes, according to the HCA. Caseworkers who make too many mistakes will be identified for repeat training, Kozlowski said. 
IT upgrades and a boosted workforce, Kozlowski said, are two of the ingredients she needs to drastically reduce SNAP payment mistakes. The third is a culture that ensures caseworkers take accuracy seriously. 
“It comes down to that personal accountability culture of, ‘Am I being thorough in everything that I do?’” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 19:57:49.401122

Long-anticipated raises for thousands of Minnesota nursing home workers will be delayed because the Minnesota Department of Human Services failed to complete the necessary steps to receive approval and funding from the federal government.
Nursing home workers expected to see their pay increase around $2 per hour on average on Jan. 1, as approved by the state’s new Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board more than a year-and-a-half ago.
The board, which was created in 2023 by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, voted in April 2024 to approve four hourly minimum wages to take effect 2026: $22.50 for certified nursing assistants; $23.50 for trained medication aides; $27 for licensed practical nurses; and $19 for all other nursing home workers. The board also voted to raise minimum hourly wages an additional $1.50 in 2027.
It’s not clear when workers will receive those raises but it will be at least three months.
“We weren’t fully aware of the state rule that required approval by Dec. 1 in order for the new wages to be enforceable,” said Kristy Graume, director of state government relations at DHS at a meeting of the board on Thursday. “We certainly share in your frustration and we apologize.”
DHS started the process of securing federal approval on Monday. The agency posted notice of the proposed changes to Medicaid reimbursement rates that will fund the raises, which starts a 30-day public comment period. After that, the agency can submit its request to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which has at least 90 days to review the application. After federal approval, the higher reimbursement rates funding the raises can start 30 days later.
That means workers are looking at April at the soonest for raises to kick in.
Graume said federal officials assured her they don’t foresee any problems securing approval, although she acknowledged “anything is possible.”
DHS plans to pay nursing homes the higher reimbursement rate retroactive to Jan. 1. The Minnesota Legislature already appropriated an additional $37 million to fund the raises in its 2024 health and human services budget bill.
Jamie Gulley, a board member representing workers and president of SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa, said he hopes nursing homes will then retroactively pay workers the higher rate, although it would be voluntary.
Gulley said during Thursday’s meeting that the Jan. 1 date was always a target, and their work has been delayed before.
“We’re doing a big complicated thing to improve the industry, raise wages, try to get some stability in the workforce,” Gulley said. “It’s regrettable, but some patience is in order.”
The board also mandated 11 paid holidays for nursing home workers which took effect this year and survived a legal challenge from the nursing home industry.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/senior-man-wheelchair-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 18:58:15.898922

Among superintendents across Vermont and the establishment in Montpelier, the drumbeat against Burr & Burton Academy in Manchester is becoming more strident and punitive. The chorus demands that the school become a public institution and misleads Vermonters with fallacious charges. There are yowls from that establishment that Burr & Burton costs more.  Nonsense. The tuition rate is the average of all Vermont high schools for the many sending towns surrounding it, according to a letter distributed by the school to its community. And guess what? On top of that, no taxes are levied for capital improvements as said admiring residents consistently contribute enough to cover them. Why does the establishment do that, and what are they afraid of? 
In one word – success.  Burr & Burton is beloved by parents, students and residents. It provides a great education, introduces innovative programs and graduates students with a path to whatever direction they and their families choose that best suites them. Burr & Burton is also the major economic driver for the area as parents from elsewhere move to the area specifically to send their children to it. 
It’s telling that those who can’t compete have set out to diminish Vermont’s premier secondary schools.  This is a power grab. Don’t fall for it.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A new legal opinion from the Minnesota attorney general’s office could jeopardize counties’ participation in federal immigration enforcement.
The guidance, released Friday, says state law bars Minnesota sheriffs from unilaterally entering into agreements with federal immigration officials; those contracts can only be approved by county boards of commissioners. 
ICE says it has agreements with eight Minnesota sheriff’s offices — called “287(g) agreements” — to assist with immigration enforcement. It’s unclear how many of those agreements have been approved by county boards. 
The Crow Wing County Board did not approve the agreement between its sheriff’s office and ICE, Capt. Adam Kronstedt from the Crow Wing County Sheriff’s Office told the Reformer on Friday. 
Rick Haaland, chair of the Cass County Board of Commissioners, told the Reformer that the County Board had not approved the 287(g) “that I know of” and referred the Reformer to the county administrator for more information. The county administrator did not immediately return a message Friday. 
Staff in the six other counties with ICE agreements were unable to immediately answer whether their county sheriff had sought board approval.
Brian Evans, press secretary for the Attorney General’s Office, said the new legal guidance calls into question the existing 287(g) agreements that have not received county board approval, but did not respond to a question about what the impact would be on counties with such agreements. 
“I cannot comment on individual agreements,” Evans said.
Ramsey County Attorney John Choi requested the attorney general’s opinion in November.  
While ICE can delegate state and local law enforcement agencies the authority to perform certain immigration enforcement tasks, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a February legal opinion that they may not detain people solely on an ICE request, called a “detainer.” That’s true even in counties that have 287(g) agreements, Ellison’s office clarified Friday.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0080-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 18:58:15.898922

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Beta Technologies has added 300 staff members to its Vermont-based workforce in recent months, and plans to add roughly 1,000 more in the next 18 months, company CEO Kyle Clark told reporters Friday.
The announcement comes a month after the electric-aircraft company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange, raising over $1 billion. The projected surge in recruitment for the company would roughly double its Vermont workforce since earlier this year, a company spokesperson confirmed.

“We intend to continue to grow in Vermont,” Clark said. “The nucleus will stay here.”
In June, Beta employed roughly 900 people in total, according to company filings. As the company’s workforce rapidly expands, Clark said he expects about 90% of his staff to remain based in Vermont.
So far, Beta’s Vermont-focused manufacturing plans have also involved purchasing some technical materials like circuit boards or composite materials for aircraft from locally based businesses, Clark said. 
Clark cautioned that the projected expansions are potentially subject to change as the company moves forward. Last month, in the midst of the company’s initial public offering, he predicted that Beta’s Vermont footprint would eventually “hit a limit.”
“We have to grow responsibly,” Clark said Friday.

Right now, though, there is more demand than the company can meet, he said. Earlier this month, Beta signed a supply contract with electric-aircraft developer Eve Air Mobility that could last up to 10 years and be worth up to $1 billion.
At Friday’s press conference, Clark said he had seen a number of young Vermonters who had initially left the state for work applying to job openings at Beta.
“They come back,” he said. “That’s a trend that we’re seeing.”
Last month, the company held a career day in South Burlington for local young professionals and students, which was attended by hundreds.
Information about how much of the company’s current in-state workforce had been recruited locally was not immediately available, the spokesperson said. Clark noted that employees hired through Beta’s internship program — roughly 90 people — are about 40% Vermont residents and 40% University of Vermont attendees or graduates. 
For new hires who are moving to Vermont, Clark said the company offers temporary residences to offset the difficulties of the state’s housing market.
At present, openings on the Beta website range from a workforce coordinator role with a salary of roughly $60,000 to a “Technical Support Lead” job with compensation up to $185,000.
Clark said the company had taken steps to make the company attractive to young professionals. Beyond paying employees “well,” he said, all staff hold some equity in the company and have access to significant upward mobility through promotions. The expansive South Burlington campus also features complimentary meals, onsite medical services and a tire-change facility.
The company is also advertising for a new director at a proprietary “Beta Kids” child care center.
“We want the best people,” Clark said.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)LINCOLN – Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said Friday that the state is reviewing the impacts of a recent executive order by President Donald Trump that seeks to stop states from regulating artificial intelligence and to limit related legislation in the future.

Trump signed the order late Thursday, saying it’s to keep the U.S. competitive with China in the race for dominance in the burgeoning AI industry.  The order instead favors a federal framework for the technology. 
 “It’s got to be one source. They can’t go to 50 different sources,” Trump said during a signing ceremony. 
Some policy experts question the legality of the order, which also establishes a federal task force to monitor state AI laws and challenge them in court as well as directing the Commerce secretary to complete a review of state laws approved within the past three months.
Nebraska, this past legislative session, passed two laws: one that bans AI-generated child pornography and another that provides civil liability for sharing AI-generated or computer-generated intimate images without the depicted person’s consent. 
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering was behind the bill, now turned into law, that bans AI-generated child pornography. It passed 46-3 as part of Legislative Bill 383. The law that provides civil liability was championed by State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha and passed 49-0. 
DeBoer said she doesn’t see a conflict with the executive order and her legislation, and hopes the state law can stay in place.
“I welcome any conversation about common sense protections we can provide our constituents and hope the executive order leads to a national framework ensuring protection for children and individuals’ privacy,” she said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The executive order said the federal framework “would ensure that children are protected, censorship is prevented, copyrights are respected, and communities are safeguarded.” When the Examiner asked Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers if the two recently-passed state laws would be under that federal framework, his office said it didn’t have a comment on the matter. 
Other proposals focusing on AI consumer protection and banning political deepfakes are still in statehouse committees. Democratic State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who proposed regulations on deepfakes, said Trump’s “ban on states regulating AI only serves billionaire tech CEOs.” 
“Here is yet another example of how he’s only looking out for his own interests and those of his cronies, while working people, democracy, and trust in government, pay the price,” said Cavanaugh, who is running for U.S. Congress in a crowded Democratic primary field for the 2nd District.
Pillen, a Republican, shared different thoughts, saying he appreciates the president’s approach as the order “does not appear to be as sweeping or disruptive as some had feared…this order specifically protects measures by states, including Nebraska, to ban AI-generated child porn.”
Pillen was one of the 17 Republican governors who opposed a congressional AI moratorium on state-based AI laws pushed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. That proposal was removed from Trump’s budget and tax bill earlier this year. It would have prohibited states from regulating artificial intelligence for the next decade.
All 50 states and territories have introduced AI legislation, and 38 states have adopted about 100 laws this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The move by the Trump administration has been characterized as a win for tech companies that have lobbied against regulating the booming technology sector.

Friday, the National Weather Service said moderate to heavy rain is in the forecast for western Montana early next week with a risk of more flooding and rock and landslides.
It said some rain, sun, cloud and fog are forecast this weekend.
Monday through Wednesday, the Weather Service said rainfall could total up to 1 to 2 inches for Lincoln, Mineral, and Sanders counties, and 2 to 3 inches in the mountains.
“Due to already saturated ground, particularly in northwest Montana, this rainfall increases the risk of rock and landslides, stream and river rises, and minor flooding,” the update said. “Continue to monitor the latest forecast updates as this system approaches.”
Thursday, Gianforte issued an executive order declaring a flooding disaster in northwestern Montana. The order means general fund money can be spent to meet needs from the floods.
A news release Friday about the briefing said since Dec. 8, the Fisher and Yaak rivers have experienced “significant rises due to historic rainfall and snowmelt.” It said by Thursday afternoon, the Yaak River had risen roughly five feet, “putting it above the eight-foot flood stage,” and the Fisher River was nearing minor flood stage.
Montana Disaster and Emergency Services Northwest District Field Officer Ed Greiberis, Lincoln County Sheriff Darren Short, and incident public information officer Zach Sherbo offered the update, the news release said.
The Farm to Market Road Bridge over Libby Creek sustained damage that resulted in its failure, the news release said. The Montana Department of Transportation said the bridge approach has eroded by 200 feet, and inspection will take place after water recedes.
In a social media post, American Red Cross of Montana said it is operating a shelter at Wilkinson Hall, part of the Libby Assembly of God Church, for people who are flooded out.
“Red Cross volunteers and supplies are on site and ready to support anyone who needs assistance. Red Cross services are free and available to all,” the Red Cross said. “People who need to evacuate large animals can take them to the rodeo grounds at J. Neils Memorial Park on Montana Highway 37 in Libby.”
A boil order remains in place in Libby for water used for drinking, brushing teeth, cooking and dish washing.
In an update Friday, Lincoln County Emergency Management officials reminded people to avoid flooded roads — even if water looks shallow —  and to stay away from riverbanks and give emergency responders space to work.
The news release from the Governor’s Office said Gianforte had planned to attend the briefing in person, but he attended remotely because of inclement weather.
“I appreciate the swift response of our State Emergency Coordination Center and local incident management teams and thank those working around the clock to respond and recover,” Gianforte said. “The state stands ready to help.”

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Agriculture and construction industry representatives on Friday backed a proposed federal rule limiting federal authority over wetlands, ditches and groundwater, while others said protecting those areas is essential. 
The Trump administration is proposing a narrower definition of Waters of the U.S., a term that has proven slippery to pin down where federal authority over waterways ends. It is key to the Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement of the Clean Water Act, passed in 1972. 
The EPA listening session was in North Dakota at Bismarck State College, hosted by Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and the EPA. Cramer said the proposed rule provides clarity, prevents federal government overreach, and is in line with the most recent Supreme Court decision on the issue, Sackett v. EPA in 2023.  
“I’m really grateful that this administration, and (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, unlike the Biden administration, has crafted a rule within the confines of the law,” Cramer said.  
Property developers said the broad rules under the Biden and Obama administrations delayed the permitting process and added to the cost of projects.
Several comments on Waters of the U.S., or WOTUS, centered around the prairie pothole region of central North Dakota. 
Cramer and other supporters of the new rule said landowners should not have to worry about needing EPA approval to farm land that might only have standing water in the spring. 
Gary Krapu, a wildlife researcher who also owns a farm in North Dakota, lamented the loss of wetlands in the state. He said shallow wetlands are the most critical habitat for waterfowl but are the most in danger of being drained. 
“The proposed regulation will be most threatening to the many migratory birds that either breed in the northern Great Plains or pass through in migration,” Krapu said.

Ron Henke, director of the North Dakota Department of Transportation, said road construction would benefit from the final EPA rules including a “broad and clear exclusion of roadside ditches” from being under federal jurisdiction. 
He said he expects transportation departments in neighboring states to join North Dakota in filing comments asking the EPA to make that clear. 
Michelle Emmons, co-executive director of the Willamette Riverkeeper group in Oregon, gave an opposing view. 
“Roadside ditches function as rapid delivery pollution pipelines,” said Emmons, one of several people from other states who provided comments remotely. 
While some comments said the rule would protect personal property rights, Dean Wilson of Louisiana said his state is concerned about protecting people and the environment from the actions of others in the Mississippi River basin. 
He cited pollution from agriculture and the draining of wetlands that contribute to flooding and hurt wildlife habitat. If upstream actions harm the Port of South Louisiana, it affects the whole country, he said. 
“Our freedom ends where the freedom for our neighbors starts,” Wilson said.
Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said the proposed rule would “empower states and local communities to effectively manage local water resources while protecting property rights, ensuring economic growth and fostering environmental stewardship.”
The listening session was the first of three for the proposed rule. Another listening session is planned for Monday in Pittsburgh and a virtual session planned for Tuesday. 
Comments also can be submitted at regulations.gov or by email to CWAwotus@epa.gov.
The comment period ends Jan. 5. 
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong said he’d rather see the environmental regulation handled at the state level.
“We know how to do this,” Armstrong said. 
Dave Glatt, director of the Department of Environmental Quality, also spoke in favor of the change, saying that state law covers areas that the EPA has not.

Debra Mays-Jackson, former vice president and chief of staff at Jackson State University, alleges that despite being qualified to lead the historically Black university, she was passed over in 2023 in favor of a man with less experience. IHL trustees had claimed qualified immunity, a legal protection from liability for government officials, in an effort to dismiss the case. 
In its ruling Wednesday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed a U.S. district court’s previous decision that Mays-Jackson had adequately pleaded an equal protection violation. The federal appeals court ruling affirms that the lawsuit can continue, and not whether any discrimination occurred. 
John Sewell, a spokesman for the IHL board, said trustees do not comment on pending litigation. Lisa Ross, Mays-Jackson’s attorney, told Mississippi Today she had no further comment. 
For now, Mays-Jackson’s case will return to the federal district court, where it will proceed discovery, summary judgement or trial. The 5th Circuit judges will not weigh in on the final ruling or decision of the case. 
In November 2023, Ross filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of the U.S. Court District for Mississippi. It was the same day the IHL board hired Marcus Thompson, then an IHL deputy commissioner, to lead JSU. Thompson was not one of 79 applications for the role, according to Mays-Jackson’s lawsuit.

This story by Olga Peters was first published in The Commons on Dec. 9, 2025.
VERNON — On a chilly November afternoon, people representing organizations across Windham County filed through the door to Vernon’s Governor Hunt House Community Center. Inside, staff of the Good Energy Collective, a think tank and research organization based in Sacramento, California, greeted participants who had come to help researchers answer a question: “Can siting for nuclear waste facilities truly be community-centric?”
As the participants headed toward a table filled with coffee and sandwiches, they paused to read flyers tacked to bulletin boards about present-day Vernon: yoga classes, bone builders and Bingo night. Outside, a steady rhythm of clangs and bangs from heavy equipment echoed from the former Vermont Yankee nuclear power station as contractors carried on decommissioning the dormant plant.

Entergy, Vermont Yankee’s former owner, donated the historic Governor Hunt House, previously used as office space for the plant, to the community as a parting gift in 2020 when it sold Vermont Yankee to NorthStar for decommissioning. One workshop participant noted that the Governor Hunt House felt to her like the only tangible community asset left from the 40-plus years the plant was operational.
On Nov. 20 and 21, two cohorts of community members attended the workshops, part of an initiative of the U.S. Department of Energy, which has contracted with 12 consortia to conduct the research on designing an effective process for communities interested in hosting a site for spent nuclear fuel.
The DOE says it is developing a set of evidence-based guidelines for “a collaborative process that would enable the successful siting of a federal consolidated storage facility (CSF) for spent nuclear fuel.” In a news release in 2024, the federal agency said a CSF would initially store 15,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel.
Describing itself as “making the progressive case for nuclear energy in a just, climate-friendly future,” the organization takes the position that “nuclear energy has a vital role to play in a just energy transition.” The organization believes that key to the nuclear waste issue is fostering partnership and collaboration between a potential host community and the DOE.

“At GEC, we put communities at the center of our research and policy work because understanding local perspectives is essential to advancing nuclear energy thoughtfully and effectively,” the organization wrote.
Yucca Mountain repository site in limbo
The DOE, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other federal agencies have been sued over the government’s failure to fulfill its obligation to take nuclear waste.
A site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada was proposed in 1987 and approved by Congress in 2002. But with development of the country’s single centralized spent-fuel storage site having reached a standstill, the DOE has shifted its focus to the creation of one or more CSFs, explained GEC’s executive director, Erik Funkhouser.
The shift came after a 2012 Blue Ribbon Commission recommended that the U.S. seek a site to replace Yucca Mountain and apply a collaborative-based siting model to the process. Rather than identify a site and seize the property for a top-down development, the commission urged what the DOE calls a “consent-based process” — for communities, industry, government agencies and nongovernmental organizations to work together in the process to develop a solution with far less rancor.
Currently, 70 temporary storage sites host spent nuclear fuel in the country, he added, but managing the waste is “unwieldy” and raises national security concerns. On day 1 of the workshop, participants answered survey questions that gauged their thoughts and feelings about nuclear issues. They also discussed the risks and benefits of hosting a CSF and what participating in a siting process might entail for the potential host community. The groups ended the day outlining principles and guidelines to steer a siting process.
Day 2 included a dive into community engagement issues, including effective trust-building and information-sharing methods. Participants worked through an ideal governance structure and a model to gauge a community’s interest in hosting a CSF. As the workshop progressed, participants also dove into what structure a potential siting should take and the types of information that communities would need to make a decision.
Participants looked at the DOE’s process outline and shared thoughts on what steps they thought it missed and what groups — federal, state, community, consultants — should take responsibility for different tasks.
As these conversations unfolded, participants raised concerns — like how to ensure that all community members are heard. Some people may not trust that the federal or state governments will treat local communities fairly, they pointed out, and some members may outright reject nuclear power and its waste. Still others may care only about what deal they can get for their town, they said.
Participants suggested that the community and its trusted partners — for example, consultants, planning commissions and the state — have the most input at the beginning and end of the vetting process. Technical issues such as conducting environmental impact studies, preparing technical outlines, or conducting economic studies should fall under the purview of the federal or state government, the groups concluded.
With a waste product like spent fuel, which has a half-life of thousands of years, workshop participants said the community engagement should not stop at the yes-no decision of becoming a host community. The process also needed to allow for communities to renegotiate their agreement with the DOE. As nuclear technology improves, host communities should be able to receive upgrades at their spent fuel pads, the participants concluded.
Another suggestion from Vernon’s workshop participants was to fund an ombudsperson to represent the community. One participant said he felt the outlined process would push communities to say yes.
Viewing nuclear power as ‘essential’
Since its founding in 2020, GEC has received multiple grants related to nuclear energy and climate change, including a $600,000 grant from the MacArthur Foundation to address nuclear issues.
Given the scope of issues around the energy grid and climate resilience, why is GEC putting all its ducks behind nuclear?
The first reason, Funkhouser said, is that “there’s a lot of eyes on the other areas, and not enough people watching the till for nuclear.”
After the workshop ended, he added that GEC wants to see nuclear done safely. He said the organization defines itself as progressive and wants to responsibly decarbonize the energy grid without leaving communities behind. “We also think that some of the affordability and responsibility around decarbonization itself were really overlooked — or have been until probably recently,” he said.
He believes that core marginalized communities in the U.S. and abroad are especially vulnerable “when it comes to increasing power prices, increasing risks in the grid.”

Funkhouser has written that “nuclear energy is essential to decarbonizing the power sector, and meaningful community buy-in is indispensable — and achievable. We believe firmly that the United States can do both.” 
In his opinion, nuclear is one of only a few energy sources — such as geothermal, hydro and total carbon capture natural gas — that are clean sources that can be accessed anytime they are needed to meet demand. Funkhouser added that he believes that ensuring a steady baseload power source is one of the necessary ways to avoid “one of the biggest social problems in the energy transition itself.”
“Renewables are doing well, but we have to have base load until we can get seasonal storage figured out,” he added.
According to Funkhouser, GEC and the other 12 members of the consortia have agreed to different scopes of work with the DOE. GEC has undergone a “piloting” phase of its work with the department, where “we were making sure that the ideas we had for how to bring these insights out were going to be robust in practice.”
The workshops represent “the end of the final stage of that,” he said. GEC went through a few steps to find workshop participants.
For the first cohort of the day, the organization recruited people it learned about during the piloting phase. For the second group, staff used what Funkhouser described as a “spatial map” to identify potential participants from throughout the area based on randomized addresses in towns whose ZIP codes fall within a 10-mile radius of Brattleboro.
From there, GEC invited a small sample group. Attendees were compensated $540 for participation in the workshop.
Small community, big memories
Vernon’s nuclear history filtered through the conversations. The plant may be closed, but some residents shared their memories as a host community. Participants listed some positive memories — the money the plant invested into the community, time spent with neighbors who worked at VY and how the plant gave the town an identity.
Negative memories also emerged: weathering the opinions and ire of people who did not even live in Vernon; what they characterized as the meddling of state and federal officials with their own agendas; and municipal decisions arrived at after deep study — say, by the planning commission — but which went ignored by “everyone else.”
For people not at the workshops, Funkhouser said, it’s important to understand that the sessions served solely to gather information and not as part of a DOE process to select or vet prospective communities for storing nuclear waste as a CSF.
In fact, the town already hosts the spent fuel left from the Vermont Yankee operation, he pointed out.
Funkhouser also hoped the Vernon community understands that it is unique: For most areas with current or former nuclear plants, those operations have large footprints and are located near other institutions — such as a naval base. They generally are found within communities of 600,000 people.
The Vermont Yankee region is small in comparison — between 45,000 and 50,000 people live in all of Windham County, according to U.S. census estimates. Yet Vernon and the surrounding communities are highly organized in their knowledge and attitudes toward nuclear power, Funkhouser said.
As the workshop wrapped at the end of the second day, he commented that it was a pleasure working with everyone and he appreciated the local depth of knowledge of nuclear issues and appreciated how seriously participants took the process, as well as their insight into what a community-based process would look like.
Funkhouser noted that Vernon was a unique place to hold this conversation, as it has already experienced hosting a nuclear power plant and still does so for Vermont Yankee’s spent fuel.

In Bloomfield, the Davis County Community School District closed schools Friday after there was a confirmed case of whooping cough at one of the district’s elementary schools.
The school district’s administrative and health team said in a social media post Friday schools will reopen Monday as the district has worked with local and state health officials “to address exposure to whooping cough within our schools.”

Staff and students identified as potentially having close contact or exposure to the disease in the school district have been notified, according to the post.
“Everyone identified has been contacted and provided guidance from local and state Health and Human Services,” the social media post stated. “Please monitor your household for the symptoms listed in the previous letter and follow the recommended steps if anyone becomes ill.”
Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a highly contagious illness that can resemble a common cold but leave an infected person with a cough that lasts weeks or months, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC recommends vaccination to prevent whooping cough, in addition to treating the illness with antibiotics to prevent serious infections.
In Moulton, the Moulton-Udell School District canceled classes on Dec. 9 and 10 “due to an extremely high percentage of students and staff out with illness,” according to a social media post from the district. KCCI reported roughly 30% of the district’s students and staff were absent, many of whom contracted influenza A, a strain of the flu.
Flu shots are still currently available at many pharmacies and health care providers, and are formulated to provide protections against Influenza Type A and B viruses, according to the CDC.
These are not the only schools experiencing high rates of illnesses in Iowa. The state Department of Health and Human Services reported in its weekly Iowa Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report from Nov. 30 through Dec. 6, there were four schools with at least 10% illness rates in Iowa, calculated using daily student absences and sentinel school weekly illness totals. Two schools in Appanoose County, one in Johnson County and another in Scott County reached this 10% threshold to be included in the report.
After the first flu death of the year in November, an older adult from southwest Iowa, Iowa HHS advised Iowans to consider vaccinations and other precautionary measures like good hygiene practice and keeping children home from daycare or school if they have symptoms like a fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, or sore throat.
According to Iowa HHS data, roughly 26.7% of Iowans have received flu vaccines for the 2025-2026 flu season.
As people gather to celebrate holidays, State Medical Director Dr. Robert Kruse said in a statement that Iowans should take steps to keep themselves and loved ones healthy this winter.
“To keep those celebrations, our workplaces and our communities safe and healthy, I encourage everyone to stay home when feeling sick and to talk with your healthcare provider about vaccination,” Kruse said.

Environmental group’s public records request shows few residents took the initiative to respond, and those who did were critical and 'embarrassed' by the Trump administration’s effort.
The post Interior Secretary Burgum asked public land users to flag ‘negative’ depictions of American history. Wyoming criticized the effort instead. appeared first on WyoFil[...]","During the opening weeks of the Trump administration, the president issued an executive order vowing to restore “truth and sanity to American history.”
Trump sought to undo what he contended was the Biden administration’s “revisionist movement” that “fosters a sense of national shame” and casts “founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” Critics panned the controversial decree as an effort to whitewash and turn a blind eye to the lesson-worthy realities of American history, like slavery, segregation and the conquest of Indigenous people and land. 
The U.S. Department of the Interior complied two months later, with Secretary Doug Burgum putting out his own more specific order. He directed the agencies he oversees to: “ensure that all public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department’s jurisdiction do not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living … and instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.”

Burgum required the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and other agencies to post signage with QR codes allowing the public to assist in “compliance with this Order.”
Some of the responses have recently been revealed. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, the Sierra Club acquired public comments submitted to the Bureau of Reclamation and Bureau of Land Management.  The environmental group posted those remarks online. (BuRec comments here; BLM comments here.)  
A review of submissions disclosed so far shows that no comments submitted in Wyoming aimed to help Trump and Burgum. Instead, they used the opportunity to bash the administration’s efforts.
More than one response to a Bureau of Reclamation placard came to the defense of the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center, which memorializes the camp outside of Cody where Japanese Americans were interned against their will during World War II. 
How awful that our own federal administration is so sensitive to be afraid of truth.” Public comment
“The center does a remarkable job of upkeeping the grounds and providing accurate information,” one respondent to a Wyoming sign wrote. “The only thing embarrassing are these signs you keep putting up. How awful that our own federal administration is so sensitive to be afraid of truth.” 
Another passerby, who came across a Heart Mountain placard, took time to air similar grievances. 
“The Interpretive Center is excellent; it stands as a memorial to those wronged, and as a reminder to the damage that hate and discrimination can cause,” the commenter wrote. “This sign and form, however, are an embarrassment.”

The commenter questioned the motivation behind the effort. 
“Are you so insecure that you can’t admit that wrongs have been committed?” the commenter continued. “The US is far from a perfect country, and trying to sweep our wrongdoings under the rug and deny they happened is a disservice to every citizen. You should be ashamed.” 
At Pilot Butte Reservoir, near the site of a recent history-rich tribal land dispute, a commenter made a more mundane observation: “Someone stuffed trash into the grill at the picnic table.” 
The only other comment submitted at a Bureau of Reclamation site also concerned upkeep and amenities at the federally owned, but Wyoming-administered Keyhole State Park: “This park needs a dedicated kayak/paddle board launching area,” the remark stated. “And a better maintained and cleaned beach area.”
At Wyoming’s Bureau of Land Management sites, the public wasn’t any more accommodating of the Trump administration’s desires to purge ignoble portrayals of American history. 
Another respondent took time to weigh in using a QR code posted at the BLM’s Poison Creek area and suggested the administration ought to cut it out: “All signs in Wyoming recreation sites should stay historically accurate and the BLM deserves the funding and resources to maintain all sites,” the person wrote.

At Warren Bridge, near the Green River headwaters, a seemingly glib comment urged the Trump administration to better fund crippled federal agencies at a time when the government was doing the opposite and laying off scores of federal workers.
“ITS INCREDIBLE!” the commenter wrote. “Everything is positive about past and living Americans but they need more money here for upkeep and conservation. More money!!!”
Only one other person took the time to share thoughts via the QR codes posted on BLM land in Wyoming. The submission came at Boulder Lake, along the west slope of the Wind River Range, and praised how nature and industry coexist. 
“We’ve seen lots of different wild animals, along with horses and cattle,” the commenter wrote. “I think this is what makes America great … that small farmers and ranchers can prosper while partnering with the BLM and NFS and preserve nature and recreation for all Americans!!”

Statewide, no comments released so far suggested respondents agreed with the Trump administration’s approach to “restoring truth and sanity to American history.” The remarks submitted in the Equality State largely aligned with those the Interior Department received nationwide, according to a Sierra Club statement.
“These responses show that Americans overwhelmingly reject the Trump administration’s attempt to sanitize history on public lands,” said Gerry James, deputy director for the organization’s Outdoors For All campaign. “Public lands belong to all of us, and the stories they tell must reflect the full story of our shared past.” 
The Sierra Club is still awaiting public records from the National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Those Freedom of Information Act requests were submitted in July, according to Deputy Press Secretary Ginny Roscamp.

Also visible are, from left, Dan Satterlee, director of the state Division of Criminal Investigation, and Sam Olson, Minneapolis field office director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A state-funded campaign that’s put dozens of extra state troopers on city streets this fall put 75 people in jail during patrols in Huron, Belle Fourche and Yankton, the South Dakota Highway Patrol said Friday.  
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden announced the “Operation Prairie Thunder” in July as a two-pronged initiative that he said would improve public safety. 
One piece of the operation involved the expansion of cooperation with federal immigration officials, in part by signing additional agreements between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the state’s Highway Patrol and Department of Corrections. South Dakota National Guard troops were also assigned to process ICE paperwork in Sioux Falls and Rapid City.
The other prong of Rhoden’s campaign was framed as an effort to target drug trafficking in the Sioux Falls area, a move welcomed by city officials during a July press conference, but that put pressure on the Minnehaha County Jail and the county public defender’s office through a crush of arrests. The first operation forced the jail to transport ICE detainees to other facilities to make space for suspected drug offenders.

The state patrol also misstated its arrest numbers in its initial reporting on its work in Sioux Falls, conflating arrests with citations, referring to the latter as arrests even when the person cited was never transported to jail. The patrol pledged to separate the figures in future reports on the operation.
Troopers have conducted six saturation patrols in Sioux Falls since Rhoden’s July announcement.
In a press release Friday, the Highway Patrol announced that it  concluded another set of saturation patrols in Huron, Yankton and Belle Fourche on Dec. 5.
Troopers jailed 75 people in total across the two operations, according to the release — 42 on drug charges and 33 on non-drug charges — and 19 people were charged with drug offenses but not detained.
The patrol interviewed 25 people on behalf of ICE, the release said, 21 of whom were held for the federal agency. 
Huron patrols generate concern
In a statement, Rhoden said the saturation patrols “are getting drugs off the streets and putting criminals behind bars – first in Sioux Falls, and now we’re protecting even more communities.”
The state did not announce in advance plans to shift its focus from Sioux Falls to other cities. 
In Huron, among  South Dakota’s most diverse cities on a per-capita basis, the November patrols raised concerns for the city’s Hispanic community, according to Republican state Rep.Kevin Van Diepen, who’s also a former police chief.
He said many residents believed that ICE — not state law enforcement — was behind the saturation patrols in the city of 14,000.
State corrects record: 78 people arrested during ‘Operation Prairie Thunder’ saturation patrol

“There were a lot of (social media) posts telling people to stay home,” Van Diepen said of the November patrols. “If they stop somebody and they get arrested on drugs, people are going to assume that it’s ICE.”
ICE representatives have not responded to inquires from South Dakota Searchlight on operations in Huron. 
Mayor Mark Robish told Searchlight “there were no ICE agents in town.”
“It was all Highway Patrol,” the mayor said.
Spokespeople for the Rhoden administration and highway patrol did not immediately respond to questions about when and why it moved the patrols out of Sioux Falls, if there are plans to target other communities, and what the total cost for the patrols has been so far.
The city of Brookings, meanwhile, posted a news release on the city website warning residents that Operation Prairie Thunder would arrive in that city on Dec. 17. 
“The City of Brookings will not be participating in these operations,” the release said.

Free.,US House GOP preps health care bill for vote before new year,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-preps-health-care-bill-vote-new-year,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans released a health care bill Friday evening they hope will help curb rising costs, though the measure doesn’t have the level of Democratic support needed to get through the Senate. The 111-page bill will likely move to the House floor next week, where Speaker Mike Johnson will need nearly every one of his members to vote to pass the legislation, an uphill battle given the vastly different views among centrists and far-right members of the party on health care issues. The Louisiana Republican said in a statement the bill offers “clear, responsible alternatives that will lower premium costs and increase access and health care options for all Americans.”Democrats have been pressing for a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits for people who purchase their insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. So far, House and Senate Republican leadership hasn’t gotten on board with any extension of those subsidies, arguing they have led to a sharp rise in the cost of health insurance. GOP lawmakers have instead pursued their own legislation, but without at least some backing from Democrats, no bill will make it through the Senate’s 60-vote procedural hurdles. Senate Republicans tried to advance a bill earlier this week from Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo but fell short of the votes needed. Democrats were also unsuccessful trying to move their bill to extend the ACA marketplace tax credits for three years. The House Republican bill, sponsored by Iowa Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks, is unlikely to break the logjam in Congress over the rising cost of health insurance and health care, potentially leaving the issue as one the parties can debate leading up to next year’s midterm elections. Targeting ‘real drivers’ of cost increasesJohnson rebuked Democrats in his statement for enacting the Affordable Care Act during President Barack Obama’s first term, saying the law hasn’t made health care cost less. House Republicans’ new legislation, Johnson said, will address “the real drivers of health care costs to provide affordable care, increase access and choice, and restore integrity to our nation’s health care system for all Americans.”The bill would require Pharmacy Benefit Managers “to provide employers with detailed data on prescription drug spending, rebates, spread pricing, and formulary decisions—empowering plans and workers with the transparency they deserve,” according to a summary in Johnson’s release. Starting in 2027, the legislation would appropriate funding for cost sharing reduction payments that the summary said would reduce health insurance premiums and stabilize the individual market. The House Rules Committee is scheduled to prepare the bill for floor debate on Tuesday by considering whether to allow any amendments to be considered on the floor. The full House will then debate the legislation later in the week before departing for the two-week holiday break.",,,,2025-12-12 17:57:55.968408

(Photo courtesy of A&E)PALMER — A new season of the reality TV show “Alaska State Troopers” is set to premiere in January, nearly six months after crews were spotted filming with troopers in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough.
The new season of “Alaska State Troopers” will be available Jan. 7 at 8 p.m. PT on A&E, according to a news release. Ten episodes will be available, A&E officials said in an email.
“In America’s largest and wildest state, just 400 Alaska State Troopers are responsible for patrolling hundreds of miles in Fairbanks and the Mat-Su Valley and serve more than 230 remote villages only reachable by boat or plane,” a promotion in the press release states.
“From the endless light of summer to the deep freeze of winter, each one-hour episode captures these men and women as they patrol the vast frontier by land, sea and air. Alaska is the final stop for fugitives on the run, where danger is vast, distances are brutal, and backup can be hours away. From multi-agency criminal takedowns to life-saving search-and-rescue missions, the series showcases a range of calls Alaska State Troopers face that are as immense and unpredictable as the state itself.”

Film crews spent several months with troopers around the state, Alaska public safety officials said in an email Monday. That included the Mat-Su, where filming took place in July and August.
The show, now in its ninth season, returns to streaming with a new slate of producers. The project is the first for Anusia Films and executive producer Anna Rodzinski, according to the release. Rodzinski worked as a writer on the show’s initial run, according to the Internet Movie Database.
“Alaska State Troopers” last filmed in 2014, with a final episode airing on National Geographic in 2015, according to the database.
Public safety officials said they agreed to the new season in part to help with trooper recruitment, which continues to be a challenge statewide.
“Ultimately, this new series is a strategic partnership we hope will build understanding, reinforce public trust and highlight the vital role that troopers have in every corner of our great state,” Alaska Department of Public Safety spokesman Austin McDaniel said in July.

(Photo by Cami Koons for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Prairie Band Potawatomi Tribe’s chairman compared immigrant detention to Indian reservations in an online video address Friday, and declared the tribe’s intention to jettison a recently secured contract to design detention centers.
“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centers,” said Joseph Rupnick, chairman of the Tribal Council. “We were placed here because we were treated as prisoners of war. So we must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and trauma once done to our people.”
A company affiliated with the tribe’s business arm signed a year-long, $29.9 million contract with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Nov. 29. The contract requested the recipient, KPB Services, which is affiliated with Prairie Band LLC, design warehouse structures on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detainees, according to a public federal contract database. Before KPB Services signed the contract, the federal government upped the dollar amount.
The Tribal Council fired members of Prairie Band LLC’s leadership Tuesday after Topeka TV station KSNT made news of the contract public the day before.
Rupnick, in a nearly 3-minute video address, said the tribe is “working on canceling this contract and fully disassociating the nation from it.”
He said the tribe risks losing future government contract awards in its efforts to extract itself from this one, but he said the tribe’s values must come first.
“I am sick to my stomach and frankly heartbroken that members of our nation put economic development — though it is sorely needed — above our moral obligations to other persecuted people,” Rupnick said.
The Tribe owns Prairie Band LLC, and Rupnick said it was created to secure employment and economic opportunities, “but it is also why we cannot compromise our values and seek to profit off the backs of our brothers and sisters in struggle.”
The second Trump administration has targeted immigrants, sometimes regardless of citizenship status or criminal history, detaining more than 65,000 people as of Nov. 16, according to ICE data analyzed by TRAC, a nonprofit data research project. Most of those people, nearly 48,000 did not have a criminal conviction. 
Kansas has three facilities that house detainees and the potential for one more. Authorities at the Chase County jail in Cottonwood Falls, the Finney County jail in Garden City and the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth detain a combined average of 175 people on a given day.

Ron DeSantis and state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo to repeal some of the state’s vaccine requirements for public schools and day care kicked off Friday with a lengthy and contentious hearing held in a hotel in Florida’s Panhandle.
Ladapo made the call to get rid of all vaccine mandates contained in both state rule and state law even though many of those mandates have been considered a public health success.
About 90 people attended the Department of Health three-hour public meeting on the proposed changes to Rule 64D-3.046, specifically removing the requirements for children to receive the hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), and haemophilus influenza B or Hib vaccine. The proposal would remove those vaccines, along with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, for admission to a licensed day care facility.
Emma Spencer, DOH division director for public health statistics and performance management, and facilitator of the meeting, described the workshop as an opportunity for “public input” as “part of an ongoing efforts to ensure the health and safety of Florida students and communities.”
And there was lots of input, ranging from medical professionals to parental rights advocates to those who questioned whether a measles outbreak is underway in South Carolina. More than 280 people are in quarantine there for measles after a significant influx in cases following the Thanksgiving holiday, Phoenix affiliate South Carolina Daily Gazette reports.
Susan Sweeten, chief marketing officer for the National Vaccine Information Center and a Florida resident, was first to testify. The center’s website says the group is “dedicated to preventing vaccine injuries and deaths through public education and advocating for informed consent protections in medical policies and public health laws.“
Sweeten said her son, just five hours old, was injured when he was given a hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital. 
“When I questioned it, she said, ‘If you don’t give your baby the vaccine, your pediatrician won’t see him, and you won’t know if he’s deaf, dumb, or blind,’” Sweeten told the DOH panel. “This is not informed consent. That is coercion. Vaccines should never be tied to a child’s education. Nothing that pierces the skin should ever be used as leverage over a child’s opportunity to education and to learn,” she said.
Doctors who showed up insisted vaccines work and that elimination of the mandates would lead to a resurgence of controllable childhood diseases.
“As a pediatric infectious disease physician, I cared for children before the varicella vaccine and saw ‘simple chickenpox’ turn into pneumonia, encephalitis, and needless hospitalizations — outcomes we can now prevent because of vaccines,” said Dr. Nectar Aintablian, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in Tallahassee. “Vaccines are victims of their own success; because they work, we forget the suffering they avert.”
Rick Frye, another Florida resident, said he’s been beseeching people not to vaccinate their children for about the past 20 years.
“Now, any pediatrician in this room who tells you that a kid needs 80 shots shouldn’t be trusted to put a band aid on a kid’s knee,” he said. “It’s obviously about freedom, but it’s also about the children these pediatricians damage because they get paid to to vaccinate these kids.”
More hearings coming
The meeting was the first one held on the proposed changes, but likely won’t be the last given the administrative rulemaking process and the requirements for public input.
The department did not say when the next meeting will occur, only that it would be announced in advance in the Florida Administrative Register.
DOH staff asked that public comment on the proposed rule changes be sent to the DOH at vaccinerule@flhealth.gov by Dec. 22, although Spencer acknowledged comments would remain open as the state works on the proposed changes.
The League of Women Voters of Florida didn’t focus on the science behind the vaccines, adverse reactions to vaccines, or parental rights. LWV representative Mary Winn focused her testimony instead on how the proposed changes conflict with the DOH’s statutory mission.
“This rule could probably be updated to reflect current practice and the responsibilities of the state, the Department of Health, private-practicing medical professionals, parents, and the public at large. But any changes must be consistent with the public health mission of the Department of Health as stated in Florida law,” she said. 
Winn noted that statutes require the DOH to conduct a communicable disease prevention and control program, which includes school immunization programs. The agency is charged by statute to ensure that “all children in this state” are immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases, she said.
“Eliminating the mandatory requirement will result in lower levels of immunization, which is contrary to that law stating that you are responsible for all of the children to be vaccinated in the state,” she said.

‘Tremendous damage’
Dr. Frederick Southwick testified that he has been an infectious disease specialist for 45 years. Although he worked with adult populations for much of his career, Southwick recalled helping cover pediatric infectious diseases in 1983 and 1984, before introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria, which would be eliminated under the DOH proposal.
“What did I see?” he asked. 
 Before the Hib vaccine, “I saw cases of orbital cellulitis, infections that went from the sinus causing bulging-eye blindness. I saw severe cases of pneumonia. I saw severe cases of otitis media. I saw bone infections, osteomyelitis that damaged the growth plate of the children so their bones could no longer grow. I saw sepsis, where patients got hypotension and died,” Southwick said. 
“And the most feared was bacterial meningitis, and that had carried a 20% mortality. And this was the leading cause of deafness before the HiB vaccine. In 1985, the Hib vaccine came in, we went from 20,000 hospitalizations to 30, and today we don’t see any of those diseases. You are ending that vaccine. It’s going to cause tremendous damage.”
The proposed rule would change the existing religious exemption people can claim to refuse vaccines, removing language prohibiting exemptions based on personal or philosophical reasons.
Additionally, the proposed rule would allow parents, guardians, and college and university applicants aged 18-23 to decline to participate in documenting their vaccination status in the Florida SHOTS program, which is how the state collects vaccination data.
DeSantis and Ladapo made national headlines in September when they announced they’d like to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes and rules, a move that could affect schoolchildren but also college students and even nursing home residents.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Ladapo said at the time that mandates drip “with disdain and slavery.” 
The proposed rule only removes the vaccines the DOH has authorized through its rules. The proposal cannot eliminate the school vaccines mandated by statute. 
The Legisalture’s reaction
To date there’s been no legislation filed on behalf of the DeSantis administration to eliminate vaccine mandates from Florida statutes. Even Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott distanced himself from the idea. 
Meanwhile, Senate President Ben Albritton told reporters this week that he’s a believer in what he called “the vaccines of old,” but that he has never gotten an mRNA vaccine — used during the COVID-19 epidemic — because “he doesn’t trust the technology.”
He said he and his wife support parental rights.
“Missy and I believe we’re going to separate the mRNA stuff from the traditional stuff. And let’s be thoughtful about what works and what we know.”
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, is pushing a proposal (SB 626) to amend statutes to require the vaccines (hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus influenzae type b, and pneumococcal disease) Ladapo is trying to eliminate via rule.
SB 626 has been referred to the Senate Health Policy, Education Pre-K – 12, and Rules committees.

(Photo by Deborah Yetter/For Kentucky Lantern)The Kentucky board that licenses and regulates optometrists met Friday amid growing controversy about waivers it granted some candidates in recent years who hadn’t met all requirements for licensure.
But the Board of Optometric Examiners  made no public mention of the matter. Rather, it met in closed session for about 30 minutes to discuss “proposed litigation regarding board waivers,” some of which were granted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It then adjourned without taking any action and Dr. Karoline Munson, the board vice-president, declined to answer questions.
“I don’t have any comment,” said Munson, a Frankfort optometrist who ran Friday’s meeting after the abrupt resignation of former president Dr. Joe Ellis, of Benton. “But have a Merry Christmas.”
Outside groups are urging the board to resolve questions about the situation to assure that public safety is protected and that eye care providers are duly licensed and qualified.
On Thursday, the Kentucky Optometric Association released a statement calling on the board to “move quickly” to establish a “comprehensive corrective plan.”
Also, Thursday, the Kentucky Academy of Eye Physicians and Surgeons, which represents ophthalmologists, released a statement urging board action.
“We hope for transparency and strong patient safety protections for everyone across the commonwealth,” it said.
Optometrists are eye care providers with a four-year doctorate of optometry degree. Ophthalmologists are medical doctors with an additional residency in eye care and surgery.
Ellis resigned on Wednesday, a day before the Kentucky Lantern reported that the board in recent years had relaxed licensing standards for 21 optometry graduates between 2020 and 2023, exempting them from parts of a national standardized exam required for licensure. Among the candidates who received an optometrist’s license without passing “one or more” parts of the exam was his daughter, Hannah Ellis, according to a May 2025 letter to the state board from the National Board of Examiners in Optometry, or NBEO.
“NBEO is trying to understand how this could have happened,” the letter said.
The board has not replied to the letter.
Friday’s meeting comes as the board continued to grapple with how to respond to an Oct. 1 state attorney general’s opinion that found it had circumvented state law in waiving requirements for licensure.
While the board has the power to change licensure standards, it must do so through enacting new state regulations rather than by adopting changes at board meetings, the opinion said.
On Oct. 10, the board held a special meeting to begin formulating a response to the opinion and how to correct any problems it identified, with Ellis, then president, saying he hoped to have a response as soon as possible.
But Friday, the board made no mention of that and Munson, the vice-president, declined to answer questions about when a response might be forthcoming.
The attorney general identified two instances in which the board improperly waived requirements for passing part of a three-part national exam for licensure, citing restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But an investigation by the Kentucky Lantern found the board acted on at least six occasions to waive part of the exam between 2020 and 2023, at least one after the pandemic state of emergency had ended.
While most dealt with waiving Part 3, an in-person test of a candidate’s clinical skills, one appeared to involve waiving Part 1 of the national exam, a written test on scientific and medical knowledge–one the board has acknowledged some optometry graduates in Kentucky had trouble passing.
Earlier this year, the board enacted new regulations that allow candidates to take an easier Canadian version of Part 1 of the exam, making Kentucky the only state to do so.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/OPTO-BOARD-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 17:57:55.968408

Peter Welch, D-Vt., holds up a letter he sent to the U.S. State Department on Thursday pressing officials for more information about an Israeli military strike on a group of journalists including Dylan Collins of Weston. He spoke at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday alongside Collins (right) and U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt. Screenshot
Vermont’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Peter Welch and Rep. Becca Balint say that both the Israeli and U.S. governments have stonewalled their inquiries into a deadly attack on a group of journalists by Israel’s military in 2023, which injured a reporter from Vermont.
Dylan Collins, a video journalist for Agence France-Presse, was reporting in Lebanon near the Israeli border on Oct. 13, 2023. He and six other journalists were suddenly struck by two shells, fired 37 seconds apart, from an Israeli tank, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international press freedom organization. 
The attack left Collins, who is from Weston, with shrapnel injuries. It severely wounded his Lebanese colleague at AFP, Christina Assi, to the point her right leg had to be amputated. Issam Abdallah, a Lebanese journalist working at Reuters, was killed. 
The strikes marked the first time Israel’s military targeted journalists in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on that country by Hamas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In the two-plus years since then, the organization has found, Israeli forces have killed at least 246 total journalists and other media workers in Gaza, Lebanon, Iran and Yemen.
Over that same time, Israel’s ground and air campaign against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 67,000 people, according to local health authorities. Israeli strikes have destroyed vast swaths of buildings and other infrastructure in the enclave. The United Nations has declared a famine there, saying more than half a million people face “starvation, destitution and death” as a result of Israel’s war. 
An independent U.N. commission determined earlier this year that Israel has committed four “genocidal acts” in Gaza since October 2023. The Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 that prompted the campaign killed about 1,200 people and led to 250 taken hostage.
Welch held a press conference Thursday outside the U.S. Capitol, along with Balint and Collins, to call for greater scrutiny of the strikes on Oct. 13, 2023. Welch and Balint said their offices, along with that of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have tried to get details on why Israel struck the journalists and how the attack was authorized, to little avail.
Sanders was not at the press conference Thursday but met with Collins that day, according to his social media feeds. Vermont’s congressional delegation have been some of the first members of Congress to publicly call Israel’s war a “genocide.”
The Vermont lawmakers on Thursday sent what they said was an eighth letter to the U.S. State Department since May 2024 asking what it knew about the attack. When posing questions to both former President Joe Biden’s and President Donald Trump’s administrations, “we’ve been stonewalled at every single turn,” Welch told reporters Thursday. 
Collins stood behind him, nodding as the senator spoke.
“I thought that when an American citizen is wounded and attacked — carried out by the U.S.’s greatest ally in the Middle East — that we would be able to get some answers,” Collins said. “But for two years, I’ve been met by deafening silence.”
In June, the Israeli government told Welch’s office it had reviewed the attack and found that no soldiers violated their instructions or the country’s military’s rules of engagement, according to a press release from Welch’s office. But Welch said Thursday he did not believe the investigation was legitimate because Israeli officials have not interviewed Collins or, seemingly, requested any forensic evidence collected by reporters on the scene or the independent human rights investigators who reviewed the incident afterward.  
“It’s clear that the IDF never had serious intentions to investigate this attack,” the senator said, using the acronym for the Israeli military.
Both Welch and Balint said they believed Israel’s strikes on the journalists violated human rights laws because Collins and his colleagues were wearing marked press equipment, and a van parked near them was labeled with “press,” too. A deliberate attack on civilians is a war crime under international law.
Investigations by AFP, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reuters and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon have concluded Israel’s strike on Oct. 13, 2023, was “an apparently deliberate attack on a group of clearly identifiable members of the media,” according to Welch’s office.
Elizabeth Rghebi, an advocacy director for Amnesty International USA, said Thursday that outside investigators had determined Israeli military aircraft were circling over the group of reporters for about 40 minutes before the tank strikes, which she said shows the military must have seen the group’s “press” markings. Collins also recalled a drone flying overhead.
Balint said at Thursday’s press conference she had little doubt the attack was a war crime.
“Let’s call it what it is,” she said.

Rural Roots Louisiana and the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, which advocate for environmental justice causes, filed a pair of lawsuits Wednesday against Ascension Parish government and the Ascension Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit organization that is funded primarily with parish tax dollars. 
The lawsuits, filed in the 23rd Judicial District Court in Ascension Parish, allege violations of Louisiana laws on open meetings and public records and raise a number of questions about the depth of secrecy shrouding negotiations between local governments and businesses vying for public dollars or special incentives. 
“It’s like feeling around in the dark,” said attorney Pam Spees, who represents the plaintiffs. “You don’t know where it’s coming from next.” 
In the first lawsuit, the plaintiffs argue that the Ascension Parish Council violated the state’s Open Meetings Law by signing and executing nondisclosure agreements behind closed doors without notifying the public and holding a formal vote. They also argue the council violated the Louisiana Public Records Law by refusing to provide a copy of the agreement when the plaintiffs requested it. 
In their second suit, the groups claim the Ascension Economic Development Corp. violated the public records law by refusing to disclose, among other documents, any cooperative endeavor agreements it signed with Hyundai Steel, Ascension Parish or the state. 
The economic development organization claims it is not subject to the public records law.
The cases stem from a nondisclosure agreement the Louisiana Economic Development agency executed last year with at least one member of the Ascension Parish Council that prevented him from publicly discussing certain “business interests.” 
The two environmental groups held a protest last week outside the state building in Baton Rouge where the state agency holds its meetings. Its focus was the government’s use of nondisclosure agreements to conceal negotiations on industrial expansion deals. 
The nondisclosure agreement with the council member, Chase Melancon, was attached to the lawsuit. It contained no details about the nature of the business interests. However, Spees said they likely pertain to deals the state and parish have struck for industrial projects at the RiverPlex MegaPark in Modeste. They include the Hyundai Steel plant and a CF Industries ammonia facility, which officials have widely touted. When the topic of those projects came up in parish council meetings, some council members said they were restricted from talking about them, Spees said.  
Neither the Ascension Parish Council nor the Ascension Economic Development Corp. would comment for this report, citing policies of not discussing pending litigation.
In a phone interview Thursday, Spees said the use of nondisclosure agreements affords the public less time and opportunity to learn about and voice concerns over projects that impact their neighborhoods. Even if word leaks that a nondisclosure agreement was signed, the officials who signed it often aren’t even willing to acknowledge it, she said.
Spees said nondisclosure agreements are becoming more prevalent at the local level, so concerned citizens and environmental groups might not learn about a particular project until a local government publishes a zoning notice or even later, she said. In some cases, it can be too late for the public to raise effective challenges, she said. 
“The secrecy, it allows for all the momentum to build up around a particular project,” Spees said. 
In an interview last week, Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois said the use of nondisclosure agreements is a common practice at her agency whenever a company requests confidentiality.
Anne Rolfes, the Bucket Brigade’s executive director, questioned Bourgeois’ claim and said she believes the state and local governments are ramping up their use of confidential negotiations as a way to approve projects without much public scrutiny. 
“They’re trying to normalize it,” Rolfes said. “They say this is the normal way of doing business…and if this is business as usual, then there’s a problem with that.”
Louisiana’s secret business negotiations need to stop, critics say

Clay Garside, an environmental litigator with the New Orleans-based Waltzer, Wiygul & Garside law firm, said he’s never had to contend with governments using nondisclosure agreements and hopes it doesn’t turn into a trend. Garside is not involved in either of the lawsuits but represents clients with similar missions, such as the Sierra Club and the Louisiana Environmental Action Network.
In September, Rural Roots and the Bucket Brigade filed a public records request with Ascension Parish for copies of all its nondisclosure agreements The parish denied the request, citing a controversial state law approved in 2024 that gave new secrecy protections to records related to local and parish economic development projects.
That law allows a mayor, parish president or top local government official to declare almost any records confidential if they determine their public release could jeopardize an active business negotiation for a large project. However, the law requires the official to make that determination in an open meeting with an affirmative vote of the local governing authority such as a parish council.
When the environmental groups asked Ascension Parish for a copy of any meeting minutes showing such a vote was held, officials admitted no such minutes existed, the lawsuit states. 
“NDAs are not the kind of record that is exempt [under the 2024 confidentiality law],” Spees said in a phone interview. “Even if they were, the parish didn’t follow the procedures of the law … They’re supposed to give the public some notice.”
Scott Sternberg, a First Amendment attorney who represents several Louisiana news organizations and reviewed the lawsuits, said the 2024 law has had a detrimental effect on government transparency at the local level. He lobbied against its passage during the 2024 legislative session, but it cleared the Senate by a razor-thin margin after receiving ample support in the House. 
“A lot of times in the legislature, we hear from Republicans and Democrats about how transparency can prevent government from getting a good deal,” Sternberg said. “I think most people want that [good deal], but those opponents to that bill originally saw it as a significant expansion of government secrecy. And in the two years since it’s been in effect, I think that more people regret its passage than applaud it.” 
The economic development group claimed that as a private, nonprofit entity, it was not subject to the Louisiana Public Records Law, which applies mostly to government bodies. The lawsuit points to a state statute under Title 33 that says certain private, nonprofit economic development corporations are subject to the public records and open meetings laws if they receive at least $10,000 in public funds in a calendar year.
Minutes from an Ascension Parish Council meeting on Oct. 17, 2024, indicate the council approved funding the corporation with more than $322,000 in public money last year.  
Aside from the statute at issue in the lawsuits, state laws don’t explicitly say whether economic development groups are subject to state transparency laws, but Sternberg said the answer can be found in Louisiana Supreme Court case law.
The Bucket Brigade’s lawsuit is similar to one state justices decided in 2016, he said. The ruling established a test of characteristics to determine whether a private economic development organization must follow the public records and open meetings laws. The court held such organizations are subject to those laws if they meet certain characteristics such as being at least 50% publicly funded, being managed by officers hired or appointed with the input of a public agency or official, or having employees who receive state benefits, Sternberg explained.
Some economic development organizations say they’re free to conduct business negotiations behind closed doors. 
Katie Harris, marketing director for the Greater Baton Rouge Economic Development Partnership, wrote in an email that her organization is private and not subject to state public records or open meetings laws. 
Molly Lockwood, president of the Livingston Parish Economic Development Council, made a similar statement when reached by phone Thursday. Her organization receives public money but has never been subject to the state’s transparency laws, she said.
The first hearing for the court case against the Ascension Economic Development Corp. is scheduled for Tuesday.

The 15 tons of products seized in the investigation, nicknamed “Ganjapreneur,” involved the search of six warehouses, six homes, one business and two storage units.
Bill seeks to rein in sales of THC-infused drinks and edibles in SC

In all, it was about “eight U-Hauls worth” of products, Attorney General Alan Wilson told reporters.
The announcement comes as the legality of products containing delta-9 THC is debated nationwide.
In South Carolina, marijuana remains illegal.
But hemp products infused with THC — the compound in cannabis that gets people high — have proliferated in vape shops and gas stations across the state in a legal gray area. The products, which include drinks and gummies, can be legal if the THC concentration is low enough. Proving they’re illegal requires testing the products.
The investigation focused on distributors and wholesalers of products sold openly in stores. Testing showed they contained illegal levels of THC regardless of what their packaging claimed, Wilson said.
“These people were knowingly selling something that they knew was illegal here in South Carolina with the intent of profiting from it, and they were targeting minor children,” said the Republican attorney general, who is also running for governor.
The 12 people indicted by the State Grand Jury are accused of being wholesale distributors of the illegal products. They’re collectively indicted on 40 narcotics charges, which include trafficking between 10 and 100 pounds of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, according to the indictments unsealed Thursday.
Hemp growers, retailers targeted in section of government shutdown legislation

In hearings Thursday at the Richland County Courthouse, their bonds were set between $50,000 and $120,000.
Hemp is often used to make rope or clothing and naturally contains very low concentrations of THC. The 2018 federal farm bill legalized hemp containing less than 0.3% of THC. People soon took advantage of that law to sell hemp products infused with enough THC to intoxicate users.
A last-minute addition to the stopgap spending law that ended the federal government shutdown in November may close that loophole late next year.
On Friday, Rep. Chris Wooten of Lexington said legislators need to act before then to curb the sale of intoxicating hemp-derived THC products in South Carolina.
He sponsored a bill in February that sought to ban anyone under 21 from buying a “consumable hemp product.” That legislation received near-unanimous House support in April but has yet to get a hearing in the Senate. Senators could take it up when the legislative session resumes in January.
Wilson and other law enforcement officials at the conference said they wanted to warn parents about the sale of dangerously potent THC products being marketed to children.
“Just because you have something in a fluorescent rainbow packaging with a cartoon character on it, and it looks and sounds like it’s a child edible or a child beverage, does not mean that it is,” Wilson said.  “These things can be deadly.”
During the news conference, the South Carolina Healthy Alternatives Association released an unsigned statement criticizing the investigation and calling for regulation of hemp-derived products.
Wilson dismissed the group’s concerns, saying it’s not familiar with the government’s evidence.
Various law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation included the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the FBI, the sheriff’s departments in Richland and Lexington counties, and the University of South Carolina police.

New England fishermen, especially those from Maine, used to catch millions of pounds of small pink shrimp in the winter, but the business has been under a fishing moratorium since 2014. Rising temperatures have created an inhospitable environment for the shrimp, and their population is too low to fish sustainably, scientists have said.
An arm of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Thursday to shut down the fishery for at least another three years. Abundance of the shrimp remained “poor” this year despite slightly improved environmental conditions, the Atlantic States said in documents.
The decision came after shrimp harvesters were allowed to catch a small number of shrimp as part of an industry-funded sampling and data collection program. The fishermen, who battled some rough weather, caught only 70 shrimp totaling less than 3 pounds.

However, “even with the bad weather, exceptionally low catch levels observed throughout the program reinforce concerns about the viability of the northern shrimp stock in the Gulf of Maine,” the documents state.
New England shrimp were a winter delicacy when the fishery was active, and fishermen sometimes caught more than 10 million pounds (4,536 kilograms) of them in a year. The small pink shrimp were a small part of the country’s large wild caught shrimp industry, which catches some of the most valuable seafood in the world.
Maine’s catch of shrimp cratered in 2013, when fishermen caught less than 600,000 pounds (272,155 kilograms) of the crustaceans after hauling more than eight times that the previous year. Fishing groups have sometimes lobbied for the shrimping industry to be reopened on a smaller scale basis, but most former Maine shrimpers have moved on to other species.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25345566224477-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-12-12 17:57:55.968408

According to various state records, Raleigh lives in Washington state, but provides telehealth services to patients remotely, is licensed to practice medicine in 21 states, and is credentialed in roughly 460 hospitals.
Records from the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure indicate that in September 2024, the board entered into a settlement agreement with Raleigh stemming from his May 2023 arrest in Bellingham, Washington, on a charge of drunken driving.
According to the Kentucky board, police records show Raleigh struck another vehicle and then drove away from the scene of the accident at a speed of more than 100 mph.
Raleigh is alleged to have later refused the board’s request that he undergo an evaluation through the Kentucky Physicians’ Health Foundation. He subsequently enrolled in two treatment programs, relapsed and was diagnosed with severe alcohol use disorder, according to the board.
Raleigh was eventually convicted of drunken driving, the board alleges, and he enrolled in the Washington Physicians’ Health Program. In July 2024, the Kentucky board’s inquiry panel concluded Raleigh suffered from a condition that included a physical deterioration that might impede his ability to practice medicine in a competent manner. The board then ordered Raleigh to submit to an evaluation. According to the board, Raleigh failed to comply with that order.
Board documents indicate that in order to avoid an emergency suspension of his Kentucky license, Raleigh agreed to a settlement that restricted his license in that state and barred him from working in telehealth or in any other setting without a workplace monitor.  The settlement also called for him to submit to periodic, unannounced tests for alcohol and drug use.

(American Prairie photo)Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has “assumed jurisdiction” of three American Prairie grazing rights cases, according to a memo obtained by the Western Ag Network.
The three cases deal with bison grazing on federal land in Phillips County. The appeals had previously been handled by the Bureau of Land Management and have been in that process for more than three years. 
In September, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, as well as the four members of Montana’s federal delegation, signed a letter asking Burgum to “assess this matter further.” The Interior Department did not return a request for comment asking why Burgum took up the matter, and if the letter had anything to do with the decision.
The Governor’s Office did not return a request for comment either. 
The September letter stated American Prairie was trying to remove “vast swaths” of land from agricultural production. And there has been a fear from some ranchers that their land was going to be turned into a National Park.
The venom, though, appears to have dissipated somewhat over the years, and American Prairie has also pointed to the economic impact their work has created. The organization also leases much of its land to cattle producers, the organization has said. The September letter argued the opposite was true.
“The claim that American Prairie ‘threatens the economic vitality’ of the state, is on its face absurd,” American Prairie spokesperson Pete Geddes said in October. 
American Prairie has insisted what they’re doing is legal, that federal law doesn’t prohibit conservation grazing, and even if it did, their bison are livestock. American Prairie is also suing the state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation over a state grazing permit adjacent to federal land that’s part of the appeals Burgum is now in charge of. 
In a statement, American Prairie said they welcomed the move. 
“We’re looking forward to the secretary making a decision in this case after more than three years of it being tied up in administrative court,” American Prairie spokesperson Beth Saboe said Friday in an email. “Since the beginning, our position has been simple: We’re only asking to be treated the same as any other agricultural producer with grazing privileges in Montana. We look forward to the secretary’s decision and remain eager to move this process forward quickly and fairly.”
The time it has taken for the appeals process “undermines the integrity for everyone,” Saboe added. Saboe also said they’re not asking to expand any agency’s authority, nor are they trying to establish new precedent.
“It is a slippery slope when agencies begin altering or complicating routine public-lands grazing requests,” Saboe wrote. “The entire system depends on consistent, lawful, and predictable application of existing standards. When normal processes are stretched or stalled, every producer who relies on public-lands grazing is put at risk.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/American-Prairie_73-Ranch_1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-12 17:57:55.968408

(Photo by Andrew Leyden/Getty Images)Arrests in the United States have fallen to levels not seen in decades, according to a new report that reconstructs national arrest trends in the absence of federal data.
The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, on Thursday released the first comprehensive national analysis of arrests since federal authorities stopped publishing detailed arrest statistics in 2020.
Arrests plunged during the first year of the pandemic and have remained low, according to the analysis. The national arrest rate in 2024 was 30% below the 2019 level and 71% lower than the peak in 1994. 
Why ‘clearance rates’ don’t tell the whole story about solving crimes

Drug arrests have fallen even faster, with adult and juvenile drug-offense arrest rates dropping to about half of what they were in 2019.
In 1980, juveniles made up nearly a fifth of arrests nationwide, but by 2018, their share had fallen to 7%. While adult arrest rates declined 7% between 2020 and 2024, juvenile rates rose 14% over the same period.
Gender patterns have shifted as well. With arrests of men falling more steeply over time, women now account for a larger portion of arrests. Adult women’s share nearly doubled between 1980 and 2020, rising from 14% to about 27%. Girls’ share of juvenile arrests grew from 18% to roughly 31%.
Between 2020 and 2024, arrest rates for Black and Asian juveniles surged 48% and 45%, respectively, compared with an 11% increase among white youth. Rates for American Indian and Alaska Native juveniles fell 4%. 
Among adults, arrest rates increased by 12% for Black people and 18% for Asian people, but declined by 10% for white adults and 17% for American Indian and Alaska Native adults.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and Maryland resident, appeared early Friday for a check-in at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore, less than day after a federal district judge ordered him released from ICE detention in Pennsylvania.
At his last ICE check-in, in August, Abrego Garcia walked in but didn’t walk out: Authorities detained him and held him until Thursday. But Friday, Abrego Garcia walked out of the building to cheers and chants, led by members of the immigrant rights group CASA to a black car that took him to rejoin his family in Prince George’s County.
Before Abrego-Garcia walked inside the building Friday, he thanked his supporters who rallied there, talked about spending the holidays with his family and offered advice for others suffering similar legal battles against the Trump administration.
“I stand before you as a free man, and I want you to remember me this way with my head held up high,” Abrego Garica said in Spanish, through a CASA translator.
“I stand here today with my head held up high, and I will continue to fight and stand firm against all of the injustices this government has done upon me,” Abrego Garcia said. “Regardless of this administration, I believe this is a country of laws, and I believe that this injustice will come to its end. Keep fighting. Do not give up. I wish all of you love and justice. Keep going.”

One of his attorneys, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, told reporters and a few dozen protesters outside the field office that the federal judge who ordered Abrego Garcia freed Thursday said Friday that he could not be detained by ICE at his latest check-in.
Based on a temporary restraining order filed by his attorneys, Sandoval-Moshenberg said the judge will schedule a hearing at U.S. District Court in Greenbelt that Abrego Garcia will be able to attend.
“The legal fight is far from over,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “I wish I could say that with this, the government is going to leave well enough alone. This man has suffered enough.”
Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called the judge’s decision to let Abrego Garcia free “naked judicial activism.”
“This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” McLaughlin said in an email Friday morning that repeated her statement from the day before.
Abrego Garcia’s return to the Baltimore ICE office came one day after U.S. District Court of Maryland Judge Paul Xinis ordered the Trump administration to release him from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania, where he had been held since September. He was released Thursday evening and spent the night at his home in Beltsville.
Since he was first detained by immigration officials in March and wrongly deported to his home county of El Salvador, Abrego Garcia’s case has shone a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
Abrego Garcia was originally deported to a brutal prison in El Salvador, despite a previous court ruling that prohibited his transfer there because of fear of violence by Salvadoran gangs.
Months later — and months after the U.S. Supreme Court’s April order that the Trump administration “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return –he was brought back to the U.S. on June 6, only to face charges of human smuggling in Tennessee. The judge in that case eventually ordered Abrego Garcia released to home detention while his claim of vindictive prosecution in the Tennessee case proceeded.
Xinis, who got involved in the case when Abrego Garcia was first deported, issued a ruling Thurday that was highly critical of the administration’s actions in the case. She found that Abrego Garcia’s latest detention, since his August ICE check-in, was “again without lawful authority,” because the Trump administration has been holding him for deportation but has not made an effort to remove him to a third country.

The government’s “conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer,” Xinis wrote in her opinion.
Costa Rica has agreed to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee, but Justice Department lawyers could not give Xinis a clear explanation of why the Trump administration would not send him there. Instead, the administration has proposed deporting Abrego Garcia to several countries in Africa.
Back in Baltimore on Friday morning, dozens of supporters braved the cold to hold up signs, chant and then clap and cheer when Abrego Garcia walked back outside the ICE building a free man, chanting “todos somos Kilmar,” or “we are all Kilmar.”
“It’s definitely a good day, but it is a good day to know that he’ll be able to spend the holidays with his family, “said Baltimore City Councilmember Odette Ramos, who attended the rally.
“He and his family have been so brave to go through all of this and to have their story really symbolize, frankly, what so many others are going through,” she said. “The fight’s not over.”

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump’s pardon of Tina Peters applies to her state criminal case, Peter Ticktin, her Florida-based attorney, said Friday.
Presidential pardons have universally been understood to apply only to federal crimes, not state crimes. Reports about Trump’s claim to have pardoned Peters, announced on social media Thursday, characterized it as empty or “symbolic.”
“Trump’s pardon has no legal impact on her state conviction and incarceration,” according to CNN.
But Ticktin says the pardon is the tool he needs to compel Colorado to free Peters.
“She didn’t commit any federal offenses,” Ticktin said in an interview with Newsline. “The only thing that she could be pardoned on are state offenses, because that’s all that are out there.”

Ticktin expects to receive formal pardon documents as soon as Friday from the U.S. Office of the Pardon Attorney.
“I understand it’s been signed,” Ticktin said, adding that he received that information from U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin on Friday morning.
Peters, 70, is incarcerated at La Vista Correctional Facility in Pueblo. The Republican was convicted by a Mesa County jury for her role in a 2021 security breach of her own election equipment that was part of an effort to find evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was sentenced in October 2024.
Claims that the election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.
Ticktin applied to the Trump administration last month for a pardon. He followed up last week with a letter to Trump in which he detailed his argument that Trump has the power to pardon Peters. He says the Constitution’s references to the United States apply to the individual states as well as the country as a whole, concluding that the president “has the power to grant a pardon in any of the states of the United States.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said Thursday the state will abide by whatever courts order concerning the pardon. But he said Trump lacks pardon power in Peters’ case.
“Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers, prosecuted by a Republican District Attorney, and found guilty of violating Colorado state laws, including criminal impersonation,” he said in a statement. “No President has jurisdiction over state law nor the power to pardon a person for state convictions.”
Ticktin expects the Trump administration to submit the pardon to the Colorado Department of Corrections, which is likely to refuse to release Peters, he said. The pardon then might have bearing in the Colorado Court of Appeals, where Peters has appealed her conviction.
“If the pardon counts, the appeal has to stop,” Ticktin said. “The appeal’s over. It becomes moot.”
Ultimately he expects the matter to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, where a 6-3 conservative majority has sided with Trump at an unusually high rate.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Members of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE) expressed concerns Friday about rising health care costs and the impact it could have on public college and universities’ budgets.
ACHE officials said shortfalls in  the Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP), which provides health insurance for employees of the Alabama Community College System and three state universities, have forced the allocation of additional dollars to a fund that pays for mandatory retirement and health insurance benefits at the expense of other funding priorities.
“If PEEHIP wasn’t an issue this year, we would have probably would not put as many funds into the Mandatory Funds, we probably put have more funds into the some of these other fund groups,” said Jim Hood, deputy director of financial and information systems for the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, in an interview after the meeting.

Board members Friday requested a $148 million increase to its budget from the Governor’s Office for the coming fiscal year that will be spread across four of its spending priorities: personnel and salaries, weighted credit hours, mandatory funds and inflationary costs.
Both PEEHIP and the State Employees Insurance Board (SEIB) are trying to address increased expenses in their insurance plans next year as health care costs increase around the country. PEEHIP has requested an additional $380 million from the state to avoid premium increases for teachers and state employees. SEIB in September withdrew funds from a reserve and authorized some cost increases to address a deficit.
Gov. Kay Ivey will submit her budget proposal to the Alabama Legislature at the start of the 2026 regular session next month. The Legislature has the final say on budgets for each state department.
According to a presentation from Hood, staff recommended increasing personnel and salaries by 1.55% over the current fiscal year; a 1.35% increase for weighted credit hours and a 1.25% increase for inflationary costs.
The recommended budget request included a 1.6% increase to the Mandatory Funds priority.
Officials said they would have recommended larger increases in those categories without the strain of health insurance expenses.
“I think all of them identified personnel and salaries as something,” said Jim Purcell, executive director of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. “A lot of times, when their insurance changes, there is also a match that the employee pays, so they were trying to address that. And then, the mandatory fund is significant for all of them because it involves pensions. Those are the two big ones.”
PEEHIP provides health insurance for K-12 education employees. The Alabama Community College System; Alabama A&M University; Athens State University and Jacksonville State University also have employees enrolled in PEEHIP.
Hood said the universities are already starting to experience the consequences.
“You can see that their rate increases are just a little bit higher than their neighbors,” Hood said of the percent increase in the budget requests of the universities affected by PEEHIP. “That is where we have tried to address their PEEHIP needs through the recommendation. Their bump up is just a little bit more than everybody else because of PEEHIP.”
Jacksonville State University is seeking a budget increase of almost 9%, from almost $62 million to almost $67.5 million. Alabama A&M University is seeking an increase of almost 7%, from $61 million to $65 million. Athens State University is seeking an increase of almost 7% also, from $23.5 million to $25.1 million.
“While PEEHIP is specific to these campuses, the rate increases will impact the funds available for other budget needs in higher education,” Purcell said in a statement. “This issue is a statewide issue that affects all entities supported by the Education Trust Fund, including K-12 public education employers, colleges and universities, local boards, systems, and other education entities.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Jim-Purcell-Feb-5-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

At a Judicial Committee hearing, two accused Darin Smith of making false claims about Capitol riot, Liz Cheney, Kamala Harris.
The post Senators blast Wyoming’s U.S. attorney as unqualified MAGA loyalist, Jan. 6 supporter appeared first on WyoFile .","Two U.S. Senators blasted the Trump administration’s nominee to be the federal attorney for Wyoming, calling Darin Smith unqualified and alleging he made false claims about the Jan. 6 insurrection he attended.
Sens. Dick Durbin and Peter Welch, Democrats from Illinois and Vermont, respectively, urged their colleagues to vote against Smith’s nomination at a meeting of the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
“There’s got to be some standard of qualification to give this kind of power to an individual who has no background, none whatsoever, when it comes to criminal or federal court experience,” Durbin said. “Mr. Smith … is not remotely qualified to be a U.S. Attorney.”
“His words in support of Jan. 6 are disqualifying for him to serve as U.S. attorney.” Sen. Peter Welch
Welch weighed in too. “His words in support of Jan. 6 are disqualifying for him to serve as U.S. attorney,” the Vermont senator said. “I mean, seriously, what are we doing?”
The committee voted 12-10 along party lines to forward Smith’s nomination to the full Senate. “The Senate is expected to confirm his nomination this month,” Smith’s spokesperson, Lori Hogan, wrote in an email Wednesday. In a second email from his office Thursday, Smith declined to comment further on the nomination.
Wyoming’s delegation, all Republicans, cheered Smith when Attorney General Pam Bondi nominated him earlier this year. Sen. John Barrasso called Smith “well-qualified.”
Sen. Cynthia Lummis said Smith had the experience and values for the role and Rep. Harriet Hageman endorsed him as well, saying, “I trust that he will uphold the rule of law, defend Wyoming values, and work tirelessly to keep our communities safe.”
Withering criticism
Smith is an attorney who ran unsuccessfully in the 2021 GOP primary against U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney. He was then elected in 2024 to the Wyoming Senate, representing Platte and parts of Laramie counties. He resigned that seat after Bondi appointed him as interim U.S. Attorney. Taft Love replaced him in the Wyoming Senate.
“I am honored to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Wyoming and thank Attorney General Bondi for placing her trust in me,” he said in a statement when he was appointed. “It is a privilege to lead this great office, and I look forward to working with our federal, state, and local partners to protect the public and defend the interests of the United States.”
Smith’s nomination came up against withering criticism Thursday at the Judiciary Committee meeting. Durbin called his nomination “a mockery of the nomination process.
“Apparently, his only qualification is his loyalty to MAGA orthodoxy,” Durbin said. “He has no criminal or Federal Court experience, nor has he ever tried a case to verdict, judgment or final decision.
“We asked him to list significant legislation he’d been involved in,” Durbin continued. “He left it blank.”

Durbin criticized Smith further, alleging he “just happened to be on the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6,” when “a violent mob assaulted police officers, destroyed government property and attempted to thwart our democratic process.”
Durbin did not accuse Smith of rioting.
Durbin continued, alleging Smith “baselessly claimed that hundreds of Capitol police officers who risked their lives that day were guilty of ‘massive incompetence.’” He alleged that Smith claimed rioters who breached the Capitol were “the victims of entrapment” and that Smith supported the pardoning of Jan. 6 rioters.
False claims?
Durbin also said Smith falsely claimed that FBI agents who interviewed him about Jan. 6 were sent by “Liz Cheney and her goons” and that Smith “baselessly accused Vice President Harris of being a murderer.” Durbin also had trouble with Smith’s alleged criticism of LGBTQ protections, constitutional due-process protection for non-citizens and other things.
Welch, too, was particularly upset with Smith’s appearance at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and his support of rioters there. “I categorically reject that cop beaters should be pardoned,” Welch said.
The committee had already rejected the nomination of Ed Martin to serve as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia “due to his ties to Jan. 6 and other things,” Welch said.
“It’s really shocking to me that we’re in the process of forgetting that 150 officers were injured that day,” Welch said. “We’re rewriting history about Jan. 6.
“People attacked police officers, and now we’re considering the nomination of an individual who was involved in the activities of that day,” Welch continued, “not that I’m accusing him of being one of the assailants … he didn’t go into the Capitol, but he was here in support.”
Welch said Smith claimed the rioters were entrapped — a statement supported by an interview Smith gave in 2024.
“So he’s blaming the police officers for what the assailants did,” Welch said. “Every one of us, [in] my view, should condemn that language.”
Interim appointment
Smith is representing the government in litigation involving the United States in Wyoming, including criminal prosecutions, civil suits and other actions. He earned a B.S. from the University of Wyoming in 1996 and a J.D. from the University of Wyoming College of Law in 2000, according to information he provided upon his appointment.
Bondi appointed Smith as interim attorney in August and he swore his oath of office on Aug. 11, according to information from the Department of Justice. His interim appointment was valid for 120 days and expired Dec. 9.
Wyoming’s Chief U.S. Judge Kelly Rankin on Dec. 4 extended Smith’s appointment as allowed under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. That extension allows Smith to serve “until the vacancy is filled.”
Rankin’s judicial appointment clears Smith of potential entanglements similar to those that dogged another interim appointment by Bondi — that of Alina Habba to be the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. She resigned Dec. 8 after two lawsuits brought by criminal defendants alleged Habba was serving unlawfully.
“Habba is not eligible to serve as acting U.S. attorney,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit ruled on Dec. 1. Judges said the Trump administration cannot sidestep the Federal Vacancies Reform Act as it attempted to do by appointing Habba to serve beyond the act’s time limits.

Kelly Ayotte in August, requires absentee voters to provide identification each time they vote. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)A Rockingham Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit Friday against new, stricter identification requirements for New Hampshire absentee voters, ruling that the law is constitutional and treats absentee voters with the same scrutiny as in-person voters.
The lawsuit, brought by three visually impaired residents against Secretary of State Dave Scanlan, sought to strike down the law created by Senate Bill 287. That law, signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte in August, requires absentee voters to provide identification each time they vote. 
Under the new law, absentee voters can do that by providing a photocopy of the ID with their mail-in ballot, getting a notary to sign the ballot, or going in person to their town or city clerk and presenting their ID.
The plaintiffs, Adele Robertson, Daniel Frye, and Regina Wilson, argued the new law discriminates against people with disabilities because it requires them to either have access to printers, scanners, and other machines, hire a notary, or get transportation to their town hall in order to vote. That creates a burden to voting that violates the New Hampshire Constitution, they said.
At issue in the case was whether the new ID requirements impose “severe restrictions” on voters or nondiscriminatory and reasonable ones.
In a nine-page opinion, Judge David Ruoff ruled that the restrictions are not severe. “Burdens are generally deemed severe when they outright exclude voters from the process,” Ruoff wrote. “Here, the identification requirements impose ordinary burdens on all absentee voters, and the possibility that it may cause additional burden on a subset of absentee voters does not render the entire statute unconstitutional.” 
Ruoff noted that the statute provides multiple options for absentee voters who might lack the means to take one particular approach. And he reasoned that voting always includes some effort, and that before the new law, absentee voters “were already required to mail or provide their application to the secretary of state or town or city clerk.”
In his decision, Ruoff agreed with the New Hampshire Attorney General’s argument that the new law — and any burdens it creates — serves the state’s legitimate interest in preventing voting fraud, a key test that must be met for a voting restriction law to be deemed constitutional. 
“The Court concludes that this is a sufficient justification for the identification requirements to establish that an absentee voter is who they claim to be and ensure the legitimacy of elections,” Ruoff wrote.
It is not clear whether the plaintiffs will appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. 
The state court decision comes as lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and other groups are suing New Hampshire in federal court over a different state law that imposes new restrictions on voting: House Bill 1569, signed by Gov. Chris Sununu in 2024. That law requires new registrants in New Hampshire to provide hard-copy proof of their citizenship through a birth certificate, passport, or other document or be turned away from voting.

The Republican made headlines Wednesday when he said he believes there’s a “better way” for the immigration enforcement operation known as “Catahoula Crunch” to be carried out.
In an interview with WRKF, Nungesser said he’s all for criminals being apprehended, but those with proper documentation to work in the country and who haven’t committed any crimes shouldn’t have to live in fear. He also said the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of transparency is responsible for fearmongering.
“Is going door to door, pulling people out of their houses and cars, is that the right way to do this?” Nungesser said. “I hope to God it’s not arresting people to reach a quota. And if it’s not, they need to say that because it’s been said in the past that they gotta arrest 5,000 people in the New Orleans area or in Louisiana. “I hope that’s not the fact because that has put the fear of God in a lot of people.”

– Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser


Nungesser, who oversees state tourism, said many hotels could be faced with cancelling reservations due to the lack of employees showing up for work for fear of being detained. He said the sweeps are hurting other sectors as well.
“I’ve got hotel owners calling me, saying they can’t get the rooms clean because nobody is coming to work. Restaurant staff are not showing up, and these people building buildings can’t complete their projects because nobody’s coming to work,” he said. “We gotta fix that, and I don’t know how to fix it.”
When asked if images and reports of CBP detainments are hurting tourism, he said he’s sure it is, but isn’t sure to what degree.
“We won’t know until after the season, but common sense tells you if you see all this going on on TV, especially if you’re a foreigner, living here or coming here, it would make you have second thoughts,” he said. “I think the images on TV do not help tourism of people wanting to come to a city where this is going on.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Nungesser said he’s heard from a woman in north Louisiana whose immigration attorney told her not to leave her home.
“I spoke to one lady in Shreveport who has a date to become a citizen. It’s a long process, and people have been waiting many years,” he said. “Well, if you’ve been on this process and they pick you up and deport you, you have to start all over again. That’s not right.”
Nungesser’s comments have put him at odds with Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who’s been vocally supportive of the DHS immigration sweep. On Thursday, Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly told NOLA.com that Nungesser’s comments were ‘disappointing’ and accused him of prioritizing non-native criminals over U.S. citizens.
Nungesser insists that he and Landry have a good work relationship. In his interview with NOLA.com, he said the newspaper asked if he had discussed his thoughts on “Catahoula Crunch” with the governor, to which he said no.
“They (NOLA.com) said, ‘Well, do you plan to?’ I said, ‘Well, I’ve been trying to get a meeting for the last several months to discuss a lot of things,’” said Nungesser. “It wasn’t a dig at the governor, so unfortunately, to slap back at me for just a normal comment is what breeds this crazy political world we’re in today. And I’m being eaten up on the radio today as wanting the criminals to be here and everything else. And I think the far left and the far right have to take a chill pill.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Nungesser said he understands the governor is extremely busy, but he does want to meet with him in person.
“ I’m very brutal and honest about everything,” he said. “I want to discuss a lot of things with the governor that I don’t discuss in public, that I think need attention, and so I absolutely want to discuss this and many things with him, and we just haven’t been able to get together for several months.”
The Republican said he’s reached out to U.S. House Majority Leader and Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise for clarification on the mission of Catahoula Crunch and the reported goal of 5,000 arrests.
“ I don’t know if it’s a quota we’re trying to reach or we’re trying to deport so many people to show what a bad job the past president did at letting people in, but some of these people, I just think there’s a better way to handle it,” said Nungesser.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nungesser-1024x820.jpg,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

One of those organizations is the Lansing-based Small Talk Children’s Advocacy Center, a nonprofit that helps children receive coordinated services during child sexual and violent abuse investigations across mid-Michigan. Their work includes offering no-cost therapy services for children to address the trauma they’ve experienced, as well as adult prevention education and other programs.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Alex Brace, the organization’s executive director, news of the slashed funding brought confusion, distrust and a feeling like their important work didn’t matter to a select set of leaders in the state Legislature.
“There was a time when organizations like ours did not exist and weren’t here to serve kids who needed help when they have been exposed to sexual and physical violence,” Brace said. “To know that this is being cast aside is quite frustrating, to say the least. … I feel like there was a devaluing of the work that we do, that we know is critical and incredibly important to our community and to the children that we serve.”
GOP members of the House Appropriations Committee, who control the majority, voted along party lines to employ a little-used provision in the Management and Budget Act that allows either House or Senate appropriators to disapprove any newly requested work projects. The vote allowed the committee, chaired by state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), to cut more than a half-billion dollars in current work project spending already approved by the Legislature for the 2025-26 fiscal year budget, which was signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Agency work projects have long been a target for Bollin, but especially Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), who began threatening the funding early in the budget negotiations that ended in October after a temporary government shutdown.
Hall, Bollin defend vote halting $645M in spending as Democrats decry ‘untransparent’ process

One major point of controversy, aside from the size of the cuts and their impacts, was the fact that the House committee did not debate or hear testimony prior to voting. Members of the the House Democratic Caucus, and some members of the House Republican Caucus, spent the last few days sounding off on Hall and Bollin for pulling the rug out from pre-negotiated legislative spending and before some of the organizations could be allocated or reimbursed with the funding.
There was an open question on Thursday about whether Whitmer opposed Hall and Bollin’s actions due to the silence from the governor and her office after the vote took place on Wednesday. On late Thursday afternoon, Whitmer’s office issued a statement denouncing the cuts.
“The actions taken by House Republicans will kill jobs and raise costs for Michigan families – just days before the Christmas holiday,” Whitmer press secretary Stacey LaRouche told Gongwer News Service, a Lansing-based political newsletter. “Even Ebenezer Scrooge wouldn’t dream of such cruel cuts, like eliminating support for students in Flint impacted by the water crisis and survivors of child sexual assault.”
Yet, as Gongwer noted, Whitmer herself did not issue a direct statement. Still, the governor laid the blame at the feet of Hall and his caucus.
“In contrast, Senate Democrats are working to solve problems by passing legislation that makes it easier for workers to find jobs and for companies to invest and build in Michigan,” LaRouche said in a statement. “Our administration will continue to review the full impact of these cuts, but Michiganders deserve to know who is responsible: Matt Hall and his caucus.”
Michigan Dems say $645M work project cuts are ‘cruel’; GOP’s Rylee Linting also calls foul

Blame notwithstanding, the sheer lack of transparency in the process to gut a half-trillion dollars in agreed upon spending and doing so to service nonprofit organizations, some of which focus on the well-being of children, was seen as an affront the legislative process and the two-way trust between government officials and their constituents.
In the case of Small Talk Children’s Advocacy Center, the organization was appropriated $1.5 million covering a period of four years, money initially planned for an expansion into a physical space that was later redetermined to be better used on staffing and maintaining programs, Brace said.
The organization had up until 2029 to spend the money, which was to be distributed as reimbursements over the life of the legislative grant.
Brace said the organization only spent up to $90,000 to $100,000 of that money before the House’s decision earlier this week.
Democrats in both chambers of the Legislature were still trying to understand if the affected organizations would be able to keep the money they already spent or if the House GOP leadership intended to initiate clawback mechanisms.
Brace said it was his understanding that the money reimbursed to them would remain, it was just the other portion of the $1.5 million that was now in jeopardy.
He also said that no one from the House Appropriations Committee contacted Small Talk Children’s Advocacy Center before pulling the plug on the funding.
Now, the organization is looking at a potential reduction of services.
“We will have to regroup, and we’ll have to really look at our budget and see what kind of things we can live without,” Brace said. “Staffing is sort of the last thing on that list. In order for us to do the quality work that we need to do for these kids, who absolutely deserve to heal from the trauma of the sexual and physical abuse, we need to have the people to do it so. Keeping them is always going to be the priority.”
What could be on the chopping block is possibly a reduction in training services and supplies, but all of those things were important to the work, as well, Brace said.
“That’s a really terrible position to be in, because all of it is essential,” Brace added. “Our budget is really tight, and it’s made so that we can give kids the absolute best quality services.”
Another organization that will feel the crunch from the cuts is the RxKids program, a service of the Michigan State University Public Health Initiative, which aims to improve the life of children and families with direct cash support during pregnancy and child infancy. 
It was founded by Dr. Mona Hanna, the pediatrician and researcher who helped expose the Flint water crisis. Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) was a big proponent in getting funding for RxKids during the legislative budget process earlier this year and championed the funding when it was delivered in the state budget – money that is now being slashed. 
In a statement, the organization denounced the cuts, noting that the House Appropriations Committee slashed $18.5 million in funding for RxKids.
“This was not new money, it had been allocated by the Legislature and signed into law to support Rx Kids expansion to moms and babies in 19 Michigan communities,” the organization said in a news release. “We have already heard from many of you expressing deep concern, and we share the seriousness of this moment, especially this close to the holidays.”
Without the funding, RxKids said there was a significant risk of a pause in the program, or outright halting it altogether.
“In the (fiscal year 2025-26) state budget, which was just passed two months ago, Michigan made a historic bipartisan commitment to expand Rx Kids to even more families,” the organization said. “However, (the) funding is not yet available, as contracts are not in place. We are working around the clock with state leaders, budget officials, and community and philanthropic partners to understand what options remain.”
Several lawmakers on Thursday said Hall’s and Bollin’s maneuvering with work projects has and will continue to erode constituent trust in their leaders and in the institutions that serve them. 
Brace said news of the cuts certainly puts that trust into question.
“To know that something that felt like about as sure a thing as possible could be ripped away is discouraging,” Brace said. “I don’t think it stops me from wanting to engage with the government. … This is and should be a nonpartisan issue; it shouldn’t be something that anybody is willing to tolerate or accept. We need our government to be partners with us on this, and that trust has to cut both ways.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/53084676258_239b554335_k-683x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)A Massachusetts judge ruled that the Trump administration must continue a program meant to protect communities from natural disasters following a lawsuit from Colorado and other Democratic-led states. 
The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program provides states with funding to proactively make their community infrastructure more defensible against natural disasters. Twenty states in July sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for shutting down the BRIC program. Phil Weiser, the Colorado attorney general, is one of the plaintiffs.
U.S. District Court Judge Richard Stearns ordered FEMA to continue to program and restore funding that helps communities protect critical infrastructure. Funding from the BRIC supported the Gold Hill Pipeline Project west of Greeley to address water supply disruptions that could arise from wildfires, floods and other natural disasters.

Weiser’s office cited a study that found every dollar FEMA spends on pre-disaster mitigation efforts saves an average of $6 in post-disaster costs. 
“Natural disasters are not random occurrences in Colorado. We must prepare for them, and do everything we can to protect our communities,” Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, said in a statement. “This funding saves lives. It’s as simple as that. The Trump administration’s withholding of such critical funding is both illegal and immoral, and that’s why we sued to stop this action and ensure we received the funds.”
The federal government declining to provide funds puts the continued existence of state projects at risk, Stearns said, therefore adding additional risk of severe destruction from natural disasters. He said Homeland Security can recommend that Congress abolish the program, but because it was put in place by Congress, the Trump administration does not have the authority to abruptly stop it.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)State lawmakers of both parties said they plan to keep passing laws regulating artificial intelligence despite President Donald Trump’s efforts to stop them.
Trump signed an executive order Thursday evening that aims to override state artificial intelligence laws. He said his administration must work with Congress to develop a national AI policy, but that in the meantime, it will crack down on state laws.
The order comes after several other Trump administration efforts to rein in state AI laws and loosen restrictions for developers and technology companies.
But despite those moves, state lawmakers are continuing to prefile legislation related to artificial intelligence in preparation for their 2026 legislative sessions. Opponents are also skeptical about — and likely to sue over — Trump’s proposed national framework and his ability to restrict states from passing legislation.
As the Trump administration loosens AI rules, states look to regulate the technology

“I agree on not overregulating, but I don’t believe the federal government has the right to take away my right to protect my constituents if there’s an issue with AI,” said South Carolina Republican state Rep. Brandon Guffey, who penned a letter to Congress opposing legislation that would curtail state AI laws.
The letter, signed by 280 state lawmakers from across the country, shows that state legislators from both parties want to retain their ability to craft their own AI legislation, said South Dakota Democratic state Sen. Liz Larson, who co-wrote the letter.
Earlier this year, South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed the state’s first artificial intelligence law, authored by Larson, prohibiting the use of a deepfake — a digitally altered photo or video that can make someone appear to be doing just about anything — to influence an election.
South Dakota and other states with more comprehensive AI laws, such as California and Colorado, would see their efforts overruled by Trump’s order, Larson said.
“To take away all of this work in a heartbeat and then prevent states from learning those lessons, without providing any alternative framework at the federal level, is just irresponsible,” she said. “It takes power away from the states.”
Trump’s efforts
Thursday’s executive order will establish an AI Litigation Task Force to bring court challenges against states with AI-related laws, with exceptions for a few issues such as child safety protections and data center infrastructure.
The order also directs the secretary of commerce to notify states that they could lose certain funds under the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program if their laws conflict with national AI policy priorities.
Trump said the order would help the United States beat China in dominating the burgeoning AI industry, adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping did not have similar restraints.
“This will not be successful unless they have one source of approval or disapproval,” he said. “It’s got to be one source. They can’t go to 50 different sources.”
In July, the Trump administration released the AI Action Plan, an initiative aimed at reducing regulatory barriers and accelerating the growth of AI infrastructure, including data centers. Trump also has revoked Biden-era AI safety and anti-discrimination policies.
Trump signs order intended to block states from regulating AI

The tech industry had lobbied for Trump’s order.
“This executive order is an important step towards ensuring that smart, unified federal policy — not bureaucratic red tape — secures America’s AI dominance for generations to come,” said Amy Bos, vice president of government affairs for NetChoice, a technology trade association, in a statement to Stateline.
As the administration looks to address increasing threats to national defense and cybersecurity, a centralized, national approach to AI policy is best, said Paul Lekas, the executive vice president for global public policy and government affairs at the Software & Information Industry Association.
“The White House is very motivated to ensure that there aren’t barriers to innovation and that we can continue to move forward,” he said. “And the White House is concerned that there is state legislation that may be purporting to regulate interstate commerce. We would be creating a patchwork that would be very hard for innovation.”
Congressional Republicans tried twice this year to pass moratoriums on state AI laws, but both efforts failed.
In the absence of a comprehensive federal artificial intelligence policy, state lawmakers have worked to regulate the rapid development of AI systems and protect consumers from potential harms.
Trump’s executive order could cause concern among lawmakers who fear possible blowback from the administration for their efforts, said Travis Hall, the director for state engagement at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
“I can’t imagine that state legislators aren’t going to continue to try to engage with these technologies in order to help protect and respond to the concerns of their constituents,” Hall said. “However, there’s no doubt that the intent of this executive order is to chill any actual oversight, accountability or regulation.”
State rules
This year, 38 states adopted or enacted measures related to artificial intelligence, according to a National Conference of State Legislatures database. Numerous state lawmakers have also prefiled legislation for 2026.
But tensions have grown over the past few months as Trump has pushed for deregulation and states have continued to create guardrails.










It doesn't hold any water and it doesn't have any teeth because the president doesn't have the authority to supersede state law.


– Colorado Democratic state Rep. Brianna Titone


In 2024, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed the nation’s first comprehensive artificial intelligence framework into law. Under the law, developers of AI systems will be required to protect consumers from potential algorithmic discrimination.
But implementation of the law was postponed a few months until June 2026 after negotiations stalled during a special legislative session this summer aiming to ensure the law did not hinder technological innovation. And a spokesperson for Polis told Bloomberg in May that the governor supported a U.S. House GOP proposal that would impose a moratorium on state AI laws.
Trump’s executive order, which mentions the Colorado law as an example of legislation the administration may challenge, has caused uncertainty among some state lawmakers focused on regulating AI. But Colorado state Rep. Brianna Titone and state Sen. Robert Rodriguez, Democratic sponsors of the law, said they will continue their work.
Unless Congress passes legislation to restrict states from passing AI laws, Trump’s executive order can easily be challenged and overturned in court, she said.
“This is just a bunch of hot air,” Titone said. “It doesn’t hold any water and it doesn’t have any teeth because the president doesn’t have the authority to supersede state law. We will continue to do what we need to do for the people in our state, just like we always have, unless there is an actual preemption in federal law.”
Lawmakers fear AI data centers will drive up residents’ power bills

California and Illinois also have been at the forefront of artificial intelligence legislation over the past few years. In September, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the nation’s first law establishing a comprehensive legal framework for developers of the most advanced, large-scale artificial intelligence models, known as frontier artificial intelligence models. Those efforts are aimed at preventing AI models from causing catastrophic harm involving dozens of casualties or billion-dollar damages.
California officials have said they are considering a legal challenge over Trump’s order, and other states and groups are likely to sue as well.
Republican officials and GOP-led states, including some Trump allies, also are pushing forward with AI regulations. Efforts to protect consumers from AI harms are being proposed in Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah.
Earlier this month, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis also unveiled a proposal for an AI Bill of Rights. The proposal aims to strengthen consumer protections related to AI and to address the growing impact data centers are having on local communities.
In South Carolina, Guffey said he plans to introduce a bill in January that would place rules on AI chatbots. Chatbots that use artificial intelligence are able to simulate conversations with users, but raise privacy and safety concerns.
Artificial intelligence is developing fast, Guffey noted. State lawmakers have been working on making sure the technology is safe to use — and they’ll keep doing that to protect their constituents, he said.
“The problem is that it’s not treated like a product — it’s treated like a service,” Guffey said. “If it was treated like a product, we have consumer protection laws where things could be recalled and adjusted and then put back out there once they’re safe. But that is not the case with any of this technology.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a free man, at least temporarily.
Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and Maryland resident, appeared early Friday for a check-in at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore, less than day after a federal district judge ordered him released from ICE detention in Pennsylvania.
At his last ICE check-in, in August, Abrego Garcia walked in but didn’t walk out: Authorities detained him and held him until Thursday. But Friday, Abrego Garcia walked out of the building to cheers and chants, led by members of the immigrant rights group CASA to a black car that took him to rejoin his family in Prince George’s County.
Before Abrego-Garcia walked inside the building Friday, he thanked his supporters who rallied there, talked about spending the holidays with his family and offered advice for others suffering similar legal battles against the Trump administration.
“I stand before you as a free man, and I want you to remember me this way with my head held up high,” Abrego Garica said in Spanish, through a CASA translator.
“I stand here today with my head held up high, and I will continue to fight and stand firm against all of the injustices this government has done upon me,” Abrego Garcia said. “Regardless of this administration, I believe this is a country of laws, and I believe that this injustice will come to its end. Keep fighting. Do not give up. I wish all of you love and justice. Keep going.”

One of his attorneys, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, told reporters and a few dozen protesters outside the field office that the federal judge who ordered Abrego Garcia freed Thursday said Friday that he could not be detained by ICE at his latest check-in.
Based on a temporary restraining order filed by his attorneys, Sandoval-Moshenberg said the judge will schedule a hearing at U.S. District Court in Greenbelt that Abrego Garcia will be able to attend.
“The legal fight is far from over,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “I wish I could say that with this, the government is going to leave well enough alone. This man has suffered enough.”
Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called the judge’s decision to let Abrego Garcia free “naked judicial activism.”
“This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” McLaughlin said in an email Friday morning that repeated her statement from the day before.
Abrego Garcia’s return to the Baltimore ICE office came one day after U.S. District Court of Maryland Judge Paul Xinis ordered the Trump administration to release him from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania, where he had been held since September. He was released Thursday evening and spent the night at his home in Beltsville.
Since he was first detained by immigration officials in March and wrongly deported to his home county of El Salvador, Abrego Garcia’s case has shone a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
Abrego Garcia was originally deported to a brutal prison in El Salvador, despite a previous court ruling that prohibited his transfer there because of fear of violence by Salvadoran gangs.
Months later — and months after the U.S. Supreme Court’s April order that the Trump administration “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return –he was brought back to the U.S. on June 6, only to face charges of human smuggling in Tennessee. The judge in that case eventually ordered Abrego Garcia released to home detention while his claim of vindictive prosecution in the Tennessee case proceeded.
Xinis, who got involved in the case when Abrego Garcia was first deported, issued a ruling Thurday that was highly critical of the administration’s actions in the case. She found that Abrego Garcia’s latest detention, since his August ICE check-in, was “again without lawful authority,” because the Trump administration has been holding him for deportation but has not made an effort to remove him to a third country.

The government’s “conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer,” Xinis wrote in her opinion.
Costa Rica has agreed to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee, but Justice Department lawyers could not give Xinis a clear explanation of why the Trump administration would not send him there. Instead, the administration has proposed deporting Abrego Garcia to several countries in Africa.
Back in Baltimore on Friday morning, dozens of supporters braved the cold to hold up signs, chant and then clap and cheer when Abrego Garcia walked back outside the ICE building a free man, chanting “todos somos Kilmar,” or “we are all Kilmar.”
“It’s definitely a good day, but it is a good day to know that he’ll be able to spend the holidays with his family, “said Baltimore City Councilmember Odette Ramos, who attended the rally.
“He and his family have been so brave to go through all of this and to have their story really symbolize, frankly, what so many others are going through,” she said. “The fight’s not over.”

Tim Walz announced a new role aimed at preventing fraud in state-run human services programs on Friday following years of widespread abuse that has siphoned away hundreds of millions of dollars intended to help vulnerable populations and created a crisis of confidence in his administration.
Tim O’Malley, a former superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension under Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty, will be the state’s new Director of Program Integrity starting next month.
“I’m honored that Governor Walz has asked me to assist in combating fraud here,” O’Malley said at a news conference. “I’m not here to serve any individual, and I’m not here to serve a political party. I’m here to serve Minnesotans.”
He added that the governor had privately assured him that “all of us have the freedom and the autonomy to act to do whatever is necessary to solve this.”
Minnesota Republican lawmakers criticized the appointment as too little, too late.
Rep. Kristin Robbins, a Republican gubernatorial challenger to Walz and chair of the House fraud prevention committee, said in a statement, “The Walz fraud prevention program should be his resignation.”
O’Malley will begin the new role once he finishes his current role as interim chief judge of the Court of Administrative Hearings.
O’Malley said he doesn’t have specifics on what the work will entail, though he said, “I believe we’re well positioned to address this.”
Walz also announced a new contract with WayPoint, a firm based in White Bear Lake owned by Josiah Lamb, to develop a “toolkit” of procedures for state agencies to better prevent and address fraud. The contract is currently for up to $200,000, said Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans.
O’Malley worked at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from 1989 to 2010. He has also been an FBI SWAT team member and sniper. In 2014, O’Malley was hired by the St. Paul-Minneapolis Archdiocese to oversee its response to clergy sex abuse.
Fraud in Minnesota’s human services has become a high-profile political issue, drawing attention from President Donald Trump, who has used the issue to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community.
Federal authorities have already charged scores of people for allegedly defrauding a pandemic-era child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services. Former acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota Joe Thompson estimated the total amount in fraud in state programs could exceed $1 billion.
Meanwhile, Minnesota’s Department of Human Services has started addressing fraud in other services, pausing payments in a service called Integrated Community Supports starting in September and implementing a prepayment review process for 14 programs, including ICS, starting in December.
Integrated Community Supports is a Medicaid-funded service that helps people with disabilities live independently in the community rather than in an institution. In a statement late November, DHS confirmed that there were 50 active payment withholds affecting 17 ICS providers, citing credible allegations of fraud.
A repeated refrain of the press conference was that there are active investigations into human services fraud, which officials said limited what information they could openly discuss. Walz also referenced “a Medicaid program” where much of the fraud, in terms of money, is coming up.
Evans said to expect “additional prosecutions related to some of these Medicaid programs.”
“The bulk of what I would consider the most egregious and legitimate tips and referrals coming through that portal were absolutely related to this Medicaid program, which is not news to the state,” Evans added.
Neither Evans nor Walz returned questions clarifying whether they were referring to a particular Medicaid service or Medicaid programs as a whole.
DHS Temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi said that the Office of the Inspector General has more than 1,300 open cases and has identified over $50 million for recovery over the past 5 years. She said that DHS Inspector General James Clark, who was not present Friday, told her that “fraud schemes are evolving and DHS needs to do more to get ahead of criminals.”

The case is one of hundreds of similar lawsuits filed around that nation against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Department of Justice.
Rosaura Genchi Garcia alleges the federal government is “attempting to circumvent immigration law and rewrite the Immigration and Nationality Act” by detaining her and others and denying them due process by refusing to let them appear in court and argue for release on bond while their immigration cases are pending.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Trump administration’s position is that contrary to decades of past precedent, longstanding federal law requires mandatory detention without the possibility of release on bond for all individuals who are suspected of unauthorized entry to the United States.
In the past, mandatory detention was limited to those individuals who were apprehended while attempting to enter the country. Individuals who were taken into custody after being in the United States for months, years or decades, were normally given the opportunity to argue for their release on bond while their immigration case was pending.
As with other detainees, Garcia is seeking relief from a federal judge in U.S. District Court, arguing that the bond-hearing decisions made by immigration judges in the separate legal arena of Immigration Court are unconstitutional.
While virtually every district court judge has sided with the detainees in finding that they are entitled to a bond hearing, ICE and Homeland Security have maintained their stance that, under the Trump administration’s new interpretation of federal law, detention is mandatory. As a result, hundreds of Immigration Court cases have stalled while the individual detainees hire lawyers to file lawsuits on their behalf in U.S. District Court.
In their response to Garcia’s lawsuit, lawyers for Homeland Security have argued that mandatory detention is lawful and that the U.S.  Supreme Court “has long recognized Congress’s broad power and immunity from judicial control to expel aliens from the country and to detain them while doing so.”
According to court records, Garcia came to the United States from Mexico in 2004 and was arrested in June 2025 for working under an alias. In September 2025, after completing her sentence in that case, Garcia was detained by ICE and held for potential deportation.
In early October, she requested a bond hearing but was denied by an immigration court judge, who cited the legal theory that he lacked jurisdiction to even consider such a request.
Garcia’s attorneys argue the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and others are ignoring binding federal regulations, past court rulings and the plain language of the law, all in an effort to “further a political agenda by the current presidential administration.”
In their lawsuit, they note that the deportation decisions rendered by immigration judges are not final unless the individual being detained chooses not to file an appeal. As such, it may be at least a year before Garcia’s case reaches the stage of a final decision, which means she is likely to be jailed for at least another 12 months, they say.
They point out that processing time in some immigration cases ranges from 14 months to 48 months, and the increasing number of appeals filed as a result of the Trump administration’s stance is creating a backlog of cases at the Board of Immigration Appeals.
In their petition to district court, lawyers for Garcia argue that while the actions of the Trump administration “will not hold up in Federal Appeals Court, it will take time to get decisions from every single circuit court — and in the meantime the government is stripping immigrants of their constitutional rights.”
In addition to DHS, ICE and the DOJ, Garcia’s lawsuit names as defendants Greg London, the sheriff in Sarpy County, Nebraska; Sarpy County Jail Director Jo Martin; U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi; and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.
The Sarpy County officials are named as defendants in the case because, when the lawsuit was initially filed several weeks ago, Garcia was being held in the Sarpy County Jail. Since then, Garcia has been transferred to Iowa’s Woodbury County Jail, which has resulted in the lawsuit being transferred from U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska to U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.

Patrick Morrisey announces on Thursday, Sept. 18, 2025, that he is asking for West Virginians’ input on the state’s application for the federal Rural Health Transformation Program. On Friday, Dec. 12, he released the application to the public. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Schools, libraries and other community institutions in rural West Virginia would be outfitted for use in telemedicine under the state’s proposal for funding from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program. 
“Those same institutions will become locations for community clinics, where health care providers go on a regular basis to meet patients where they are, in person,” the application says. 
The governor’s office released the application Friday afternoon. Morrisey’s office submitted it to the federal government last month. 
“West Virginia is ready to lead the nation in rural health innovation,” Morrisey said in a news release Friday. “By releasing this application to the public, communities and stakeholders can see firsthand how they can participate in this historic investment to shape the future of health care in our state.”
West Virginia is eligible for more than $100 million per year over five years from the federal program, which was a part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act President Donald Trump signed into law this summer. The program aims to “transform the existing rural health care infrastructure and build sustainable health care systems that expand access, enhance quality of care, and improve outcomes for patients,” according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.
The application outlines seven “flagship” initiatives for which the state would use the funding, including a “Connected Caregrid,” meant to help West Virginians who struggle to find care because physicians are too far away. 
Overall, the state seeks to use the federal funding to “revolutionize rural health care in West Virginia.” State officials expect to hear from the federal government about their funding award by the end of the year. 
In addition to expanding telehealth access, the state would use the funding to address the state’s health care worker shortage by recruiting West Virginia high school students to health care careers, adding health care faculty at regional and technical colleges and using financial incentives to attract and keep providers in rural areas. 
Another of the initiatives, the Rural Health Link, would provide patients access to transportation to medical appointments using public buses, rideshare services and volunteer drivers.  
As part of the application, 41 “stakeholders” from around the state signed on to a letter of support. They include health systems, universities, state agencies, insurance companies and more. 
“For West Virginians to thrive, we must prioritize and transform rural health care,” Jason Landers, president of Highmark Health Options West Virginia, said in the letter. “Success will depend on a coordinated, determined and multifaceted approach uniting public and private sectors. Highmark Health Options West Virginia is proud to be an active, engaged and collaborative partner in these efforts, profoundly invested in our West Virginia neighbors, and committed to our mission of improving lives through better health.”
The state’s complete application and supporting documents are available on Morrisey’s website, https://governor.wv.gov/rht.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-12 21:16:31+00:00,CT Mirror,"Defense bill will boost CT contractors, including Electric Boat",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/12/ndaa-connecticut-electric-boat-submarines-pratt-whitney-sikorsky/,"The National Defense Authorization Act will bolster CT's big three defense companies — Electric Boat, Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney.","Connecticut defense contractors are poised to benefit from the yearly boosts in Congress’ defense policy bill, including funding to address budget shortfalls for submarine programs predominantly built by Groton-based Electric Boat.
Similar to past years, the National Defense Authorization Act will bolster the state’s big three defense companies — General Dynamics Electric Boat, Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney — and the suppliers that work with them, as well as the country’s shipbuilding needs as it deals with rising costs and production backlogs.
That includes additional funding for the Virginia-class submarine program to maintain its two-per-year build rate, as well as new contracting authority for the Columbia-class program. U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said that will help address gaps that were left in other pieces of federal legislation.
The U.S. House easily passed the $901 billion fiscal year 2026 NDAA this week after lawmakers in both chambers negotiated a compromise over the past couple of months. The U.S. Senate will take it up next week, and once it fully clears Congress, President Donald Trump is expected to sign it into law. The policy bill only authorizes funding, since Congress approves the money through its spending bills.
In addition to Connecticut’s defense priorities, the NDAA also authorizes a 3.8% pay raise for service members and reasserts Congress’ authority over military matters, along with repealing the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force against Iraq.
The bill also provides a rare — and bipartisan — moment of congressional oversight of Trump’s administration and the Pentagon. It withholds some of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget until he releases videos of strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. And it requires the administration to notify Congress and provide a reason about the removal or transfer of members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, combatant commanders and Judge Advocates General.
“Nearly one year into the Trump Administration, the House and Senate majorities have rarely acted as a check and balance on the President’s agenda,” Courtney said in a statement. “Passage of these bipartisan oversight measures and modifications of the Trump budget is a refreshingly healthy moment in the 119th Congress.”
Connecticut’s entire House delegation voted in support of the NDAA, with the exception of U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District. She said the price tag on the defense policy bill was more money than what was originally requested, something she took issue with as domestic programs and social services get hit by funding cuts.
“At a time when President Trump is scrutinizing every federal dollar for critical domestic programs, we continue to increase the defense budget without proper oversight or reform,” Hayes said in a statement. “I acknowledge the wins that were achieved in this legislation, but there comes a point where we have to demand reform of our defense appropriations.”
While others in the delegation voted for the bill, they expressed disappointment with the omission of other provisions in the final NDAA.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, praised the inclusion of the outbound investment screening requirements, which the bill says gives the president the authority to “prevent countries of concern from exploiting United States capital to undermine United States national security and foreign policy interests.”
But DeLauro was frustrated that Republican leaders stripped out certain measures like the expansion of military families’ health insurance to cover fertility treatments including in vitro fertilization, also known as IVF. 
“This bill is better than prior years,” DeLauro said in a statement, “but I am frustrated that Speaker [Mike] Johnson has continued his practice of making 11th hour unilateral decisions that undermine bipartisan progress on other areas, including the inclusion of riders that seek to discriminate against LGBTQI+ servicemembers, and restricting families’ access to IVF.”
On submarine funding, the NDAA authorizes an additional $1.9 billion for the nuclear-powered Virginia-class program. A billion of that came from a Courtney amendment that he said was meant to address “glaring shortfalls” in funding for the program.
On top of that, the defense policy bill also authorizes an additional $615 million for advanced procurement for the program, which he said also helps with the wage boosts for shipyard workers that were part of the new labor contract agreements in the spring.  
Courtney, the ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, had attributed the shortfall to the administration’s two-pronged approach to funding the procurement of two Virginia-class for the new fiscal year: paying for one boat through the standard budget process and covering the other through the budget reconciliation process used to pass Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
His eastern Connecticut district includes Electric Boat’s Groton shipyard and many of the suppliers that work with the General Dynamics company. Electric Boat locations in Groton and Quonset Point, R.I., handle much of the Virginia-class program, along with Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia.
Electric Boat is also the lead contractor on the Columbia-class program, the nuclear-powered ballistic missile vessels that will replace its Ohio-class submarines. It is similarly working with Newport News Shipbuilding on the construction.
The NDAA also authorizes incremental funding for the Columbia-class program, new contracting authority for five new submarines and an additional $700 million for advanced procurement. 
Courtney had been frustrated about the lack of funding for the Columbia program in last month’s spending package that reopened the government after a 43-day shutdown.
Those authorizations could help Electric Boat and others address the growing costs of materials and backlogs in production as the submarine industry tries to meet the long-term goals of both the Navy and a U.S. submarine deal with Australia.
“With a continued two-per-year for Virginia-class submarines, alongside the Columbia-class now in full production, submarine shipyards are reaching all-time high tonnage output,” Courtney said. “The investments in this bill for workforce hiring and retention, facilities and supply chains will drive growth of a new generation of shipbuilders to meet our nation’s call.”
The NDAA also includes multiyear procurement and authorizations for the modernization of Black Hawk helicopters, as well as the procurement of CH-53K heavy lift helicopters, which are both constructed at Sikorsky in Stratford. And it authorizes funding for F-35 fighter jets, which uses F135 engines solely produced by Pratt & Whitney.  
There’s also a couple of U.S. Coast Guard provisions, including the ability to use existing funds to help complete the construction of the National Coast Guard Museum in New London, which until now wasn’t allowed to get funding from the service.
The NDAA also includes a safe-to-report policy that Courtney has been pushing for years and has inserted in other legislation. The measure offers protections for cadets who report instances of sexual assault or harassment to ensure they are not punished for minor violations under the Uniform Code of Military Justice that might have been committed when the crime took place. Such incidents include underage drinking, substance abuse, violations of curfew or being in areas that are off limits.
These protections have been in place at other military academies after Congress passed a defense policy bill in 2021. But the Coast Guard and its service academy were excluded because of jurisdiction issues. Unlike other military branches covered under the Pentagon, the Coast Guard reports to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
The U.S. Coast Guard Academy adopted its own safe-to-report policy, which protects someone reporting sexual assault — as well as a bystander trying to prevent it from occurring — from “minor collateral violations” including underage drinking, violating barracks rules and prohibited relationships. That policy was adopted in response to the news that the Coast Guard had concealed an investigation known as “Operation Fouled Anchor” that looked into sexual assault claims made between 1988 and 2006 at the New London service academy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25108024071749-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)An influential Democratic-Farmer-Labor official in northern Minnesota resigned Friday, a little over a year after she was charged with criminal vehicular homicide.
On Monday, the Reformer reported the DFL party was standing by 8th District DFL Chair Cyndy Martin despite the charge.
Local congressional district parties aren’t controlled by the state party, but state officials declined to use their influence to pressure Martin to resign. DFL Chair Richard Carlbom, who previously said he would wait for “due process to play out,” thanked Martin for her service in a Friday statement to the Reformer.
​​“We appreciate Cyndy Martin’s years of service to the party and will be providing the necessary support as local units work to fill the open leadership roles. Our focus right now is to work with the people of Northern Minnesota to build electoral strength for 2026,” Carlbom said.
On the evening of July 3, 2024, police in Itasca County responded to a report of a person lying in the lane of Highway 169, near Nashwauk. They discovered the body of 19-year-old Carter Haithcock, who was pronounced dead at the scene.
Martin the next morning called 911 and said that she may have been involved in a collision near Nashwauk the night before. Four months later, prosecutors charged Martin with a felony count of criminal vehicular homicide.
Martin last month pleaded not guilty to the charge, and she faces up to 10 years in prison.
According to court documents, Martin told police she didn’t stop after the July 2024 collision.
“She believed she struck an owl or a turkey. (Martin) stated she did not stop, and continued home,” the criminal complaint reads.
The incident split Democrats between those who believed due process should play out for the accused and those who think a personal scandal will derail the goals of northern Minnesota Democrats.
Martin was one of the most influential DFL figures in northern Minnesota. In addition to chairing the 8th District party, she sat on the DFL’s Constitution, Bylaws and Rules Committee. She was also a successful fundraiser and has connections with statewide elected officials.
Martin’s resignation comes one day before the DFL’s State Central Committee is scheduled to meet.

Timothy Reeder (R-Pitt) talks about a bill regulating the sale and purchase of edibles containing cannabinoids from hemp on April 9, 2025 (Photo: Screenshot/NC Newsline) Even with a new federal law set to ban intoxicating hemp products next year, the North Carolina task force focused on reducing child death and injury is renewing its call for a state law to prevent people younger than 21 from purchasing edibles. 
The state has come close to making it illegal to sell gummies, drinks, and other products with hemp-derived THC to kids. The N.C. House and Senate have passed bills back and forth, but have yet to agree on the details.
The task force voted to recommend restrictions on hemp consumables after hearing from Dabney Ferris, who said she became addicted to THC products when she was 15 and is now sober. 
“Had there been laws in place, had they been harder to get, I may never have become addicted,” she told the task force Tuesday. 
Ferris spoke at a press conference at the Legislative Building earlier this year in support of a new law. 
The federal ban is set to begin in November 2026. Nevertheless, the task force decided to renew its recommendation for age restrictions because the ban won’t kick in for months — leaving kids, as one member said, “in limbo.”
The Child Fatality Task Force votes each year on legislative recommendations, and several approved Tuesday are repeats of requests from previous years.
The group will continue to support making it illegal to sell tobacco products, including vapes, to people younger than 21. Raising the age from 18 to 21 would align the state with federal law. 
The task force also voted to continue its long-time support for stronger child passenger safety laws, Recommendations include requiring children younger than 8 to sit in the rear seat when the vehicle has a passenger-side front air bag. The current cut-off is age 5. The updated law should also clarify that infants and toddlers must ride in rear-facing car seats, the recommendation says. 
In another holdover from previous years, the task force voted to support hiring more school social workers, counselors, nurses, and psychologists. 
The task force voted to endorse the efforts of other groups working to restrict social media companies’ use of minors’ data. The intent is to make targeting less effective and reduce the potential for addiction. 
The task force will meet again in February to consider more recommendations before finalizing its annual legislative report.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-09-at-11.05.45-AM-1024x547.png,,,2025-12-12 16:59:26.495656

(Photo by Erica Spackman/USDA)Nearly two dozen U.S. senators urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a letter, to “prioritize” a vaccine strategy for the highly pathogenic avian influenza.
The virus has impacted more than 184 million commercial and backyard poultry birds and more than 1,000 head of dairy cattle since February 2022, 
The letter comes as detections of the bird flu have increased over the winter months in states across the country, according to reporting from the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

A case of bird flu was detected in Iowa Dec. 2, in a Hamilton County commercial turkey flock, and as recently as Tuesday in flocks in Indiana, North Dakota, Minnesota and Washington. 
The bipartisan letter, which included Iowa Republicans Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley, said a “thoughtful and comprehensive vaccine strategy” would “strengthen” the nation’s ability to fight the bird flu, as it prepares for a “resurgence.”
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins launched a $1 billion plan in February to combat the ongoing outbreak of the H5N1 virus. Part of that plan included $100 million for research into a bird flu vaccine and other potential treatments. 
The letter said USDA has a “draft proposal of an avian flu vaccine strategy for poultry” that is “currently under review” and the signed senators urged the department to advance the process with “speed and diligence.” 
A draft proposal for a bird flu vaccine strategy had not been filed in the Federal Register as of Friday. In June, Reuters reported USDA was “considering” a plan to vaccinate poultry for HPAI and expected the plan would be completed in July. 
USDA did not respond Friday to a request for comment and for additional information on the vaccination plan. 
Members of the Congressional Chicken Caucus, representing the interests of poultry producing states, submitted a letter to Rollins in February, noting they were wary of a vaccine, as it might interrupt export markets. 
While the December letter from senators urged the advancement of the vaccine process, it also asked for “proactive consultation with affected stakeholders.” 
“Any finalized vaccine strategy must take into account feedback from animal health stakeholders, industry experts, and be grounded in sound science,” the letter said. 
Senators said the vaccine strategy should also address “all impacted species” of poultry and that the department should then prioritize a vaccine strategy for dairy cattle. 
“Finally, as the USDA rolls out any avian flu vaccine strategy, it is critical that clear and transparent communication to producers, veterinarians, and state animal health officials, along with direct guidance and resources are in place,” the letter said. 
The letter was addressed to Rollins and dated Dec. 11. Signees included: Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota; Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota; Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pennsylvania; Sen. John Thune R-South Dakota; Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona; Sen. James Justice, R-West Virginia; Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Michigan; Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York; Sen.

(Photo via Florida House)Florida’s University Chancellor Ray Rodrigues was already the highest-paid state employee with his more tha $441K salary, beating out the No. 2 employee (Education Commissioner Anastasios “Stasi” Kamoutsas) by roughly $110K.
But on Friday, that financial lead grew when the Board of Governors of the State University System approved a three-year contract extension including a $600,000 base salary with a chance at a 20% performance bonus. This makes Rodrigues the highest-paid state employee by far, according to the database of state employee salaries. The effective date is Jan. 1
He nearly doubles Kamoutsas’ $330K salary. But Kamoutsas was one of the biggest supporters of Rodrigues’ pay increase.
“When we talk about what a national model this state is in higher education and the envy of the country … I can’t emphasize enough how deserving he is,” Kamoutsas said during Friday’s Board of Governors meeting. “Not just of this pay increase, but honestly more.”
According to the contract amendment, raises in Rodrigues’ contract are paid from Board of Governors Foundation funds, which are considered private. When the state began setting up its new accrediting body under direction from Gov. Ron DeSantis, the BOG in July transferred $4 million in budget allocated funds to that foundation.
The new contract expires in 2029 and provides a $75,000 annual housing stipend and $12,000 a car allowance.
Eric Silagy, former CEO of Florida Power & Light, was the lone BOG member to vote against the new contract — which he claimed was submitted to members at the 11th hour.
“I hear you loud and clear on the fact that taxpayers aren’t directly paying this increase, but it is coming through universities’ foundations,” he said, calling the increase “significant” and unprecedented for an employee staying in the same role. “And so, it is money that would otherwise be able to be spent for other things that would benefit students.”
Various university presidents make more than Rodrigues, but state law requires university president contracts to be paid by foundation funds once they exceed $200,000. 
The contract defines Rodrigues’ responsibilities as ensuring “the efficient operations of the Board” and he “is authorized to enter into any contract necessary for the operation of the Board to employ all personnel and establish policies and procedure, incident to Board personnel and operations, and to submit and annual legislative budget request and any amendments thereto for the Board office to the Board for approval.”
Rodrigues “shall serve as the Board’s liaison for communications with university boards of trustees, university presidents and other university officers and employees, the Governors and the Governor’s staff, the Legislature and the Legislature’s staff, the media, other state entities, and the public.”
Rodrigues has served as university chancellor since 2022. He’s now paid a $441,252 salary, some $40,000 more than under his first contract. Rodrigues previously served 12 years in the Florida Legislature.

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderATLANTA — The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Fulton County for refusing to turn over voter records from the 2020 election, escalating an ongoing legal campaign aimed at forcing state and local officials to disclose sensitive voter roll information to the federal government.
The lawsuit, filed in a federal district court in Atlanta, demanded that Fulton County turn over “all used and void ballots, stubs of all ballots, signature envelopes, and corresponding envelope digital files,” from the 2020 election. It also accuses Fulton County Clerk Ché Alexander of violating federal laws for refusing to relinquish the records.
In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said the records were needed to protect U.S. citizens from “vote dilution.”
Trump has long claimed — without evidence — that the 2020 election was stolen in Georgia and other swing states, blaming his loss on unfounded accusations of rampant voting fraud, even though two recounts affirmed former President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. In an interview with POLITICO published earlier this week, Trump claimed that in the next few months, evidence would emerge to prove that 2020 was “a rigged election.”
Dhillon first requested Fulton County’s 2020 election records in October, following a subpoena over the same records issued by the State Election Board in 2024. In a letter to the Fulton County Board of Election, she argued that the records were needed to “ascertain Georgia’s compliance” with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the 2002 Help America Vote Act.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

However, Alexander denied Dhillon’s request, according to the lawsuit, stating that the records were under seal and could not be released without a court order. Alexander did not immediately reply to a request for comment Friday.
The Justice Department also filed lawsuits against Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Nevada on Friday to compel the states to turn over their voter registration lists.
The Justice Department has requested voter data from 40 states and filed lawsuits against 18 states that refused to provide the records, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which is tracking the requests. Officials told Stateline that the records will be shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in an effort to locate noncitizens on the voting rolls.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8422.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 15:57:34.779937

A new influenza A(H3N2) virus strain renamed “H3N2 subclade K,” which is circulating widely today, was identified by health organizations months after the seasonal influenza vaccine was developed. 
The World Health Organization selected the components for the northern hemisphere influenza vaccine between February and March of this year. Since August, there has been a rapid increase of A(H3N2) subclade K.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains that even if the current vaccine does not match the flu virus mutation that is currently being spread — the “K” variant — vaccination continues to protect against severe illness, hospitalization and death, as well as offering protection against other influenza viruses and help reduce the overall community spread.
Connecticut Public Health confirmed a Hartford County resident died from influenza the week of Oct. 25.

Evidence shows he’s slinging quesadillas.,Molly Minta and Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/12/jackson-councilman-dope-boys-accusation/,"Jackson City Councilman Kenneth Stokes has taken exceptional steps to target his nephew Daniel Cooper’s food truck. Stokes has repeatedly called police, complained to city departments and used his own vehicle to block the lot where the food truck operates.","Kenneth Stokes is preoccupied with the concept of “dope boys.”
It’s one of the longtime Jackson city councilman’s go-to insults, hurled toward people he blames for the city’s woes. “Dope boys are controlling this city,” he said during a December council meeting.
He has recently zeroed in on the owner of a food truck that secured a business license with the city last year and operates on an empty lot near Stokes’ home in central Jackson’s Georgetown neighborhood.

The blue trailer housing Georgetown Grub is one of few places in the area to grab a bite. It serves wings, quesadillas, cheesesteaks and fried broccoli across from an abandoned Jasco gas station. 
Stokes alleges it serves dope. 
“The dope boys have found a way to get the planning department to help give permission and permits for them to have food trucks,” he said from behind the council dais. “They’re not selling food, but they’re selling dope.”
This, in part, is what inspired Stokes’ new ordinance, enacted Dec. 2, banning city employees from maintaining any kind of business or personal relationship with anyone “known to be engaged in illegal drug activity.” 
The new law perplexed some Jacksonians, leaving them to wonder what conspiracies are afoot at City Hall. But for residents in Georgetown, it’s clear the origin of Stokes’ decree is more personal – considering the owner of the supposed drug-deal-on-wheels is the councilman’s own nephew, Daniel Cooper.
An HVAC technician who manages several rental homes in the neighborhood, Cooper said he opened the mobile restaurant – which, indeed, sells food – last year after cleaning up an abandoned lot owned by his late grandfather.

Cooper, who now lives in Clinton with his wife and teenage son, said he wanted to help revitalize the neighborhood where he grew up. But ever since he returned to Georgetown, Cooper said he’s dealt with harassment from the councilman. Mississippi Today found no Jackson drug sale charges in Cooper’s history. 
“He thinks he can’t be touched. He thinks that everybody sells dope,” Cooper said of Stokes. “But he met his match with me because I’m not scared to fight back, because I know I’m not doing nothing illegal.”
“I’m not going to let a lie run me from that lot and diminish my father and my grandfather’s legacy,” Cooper said.
Not only does Stokes say the food truck is a dope operation, he also claims it has no authority to operate there on a major thoroughfare at the intersection of Woodrow Wilson and Ludlow avenues. That’s because of its complicated ownership status: The lot is heirs property, meaning its owner did not leave a will when he died.

Several people have a potential stake in the property, including Cooper’s father and, since his wife died, Stokes and their children.
The city’s longest serving councilmember elected in 1989, Stokes has taken exceptional steps to target Cooper’s business, repeatedly calling the cops, complaining to city business departments, blocking the entrance of the lot with his own truck and now using it to justify his nebulous ordinance.
The ordinance, which was not reviewed by the city’s legal office before passage, requires employees who know of colleagues with relationships to drug dealers to “immediately” disclose the information to the city attorney. 
Earlier this week, City Attorney Drew Martin said no one, including Stokes, has made such a report.
There’s little dispute that Georgetown, a historically Black neighborhood in a census tract with a poverty rate of over 30%, experiences crime because of the presence of narcotics. 
“He does have concerns that there are folks in that part of town who are engaged in illegal activity, and I share his concerns,” Pieter Teeuwissen, the city’s chief administrative officer and a former Hinds County judge, said of Stokes. “I can’t say I share those concerns about these individuals.” 
The neighborhood is also home to elderly and working class people who live in colorful, well-kept homes, enjoy fresh produce from a community garden and generally love their community.

But Stokes and one of his neighbors and allies, Geneva Johnson, are adamant that Georgetown is overridden with dope dealers, who they say congregate at the barber shop across the street from the food truck and, before it closed, the Jasco at the same intersection. Stokes takes credit for shuttering the gas station. 
Johnson said she’s experienced multiple burglaries, and that despite her numerous calls, police have neglected to address the dope problem. She estimates drug dealers live in 13 out of 24 houses on her block. This activity is one reason they allege Cooper must be involved with drugs.
“If they were not involved with drugs, why would they locate there, in a drug haven?” Stokes said.
Ten years ago, police raided the building housing the barbershop, finding $6,000 worth of methamphetamine. Its owner Shawn Morrow was arrested, but he said the drugs were found in a separate unit from his shop, and his guilty plea was deferred, meaning the court dismissed the charges after he completed three years of probation. 
In the last two years, police have recorded two calls at the address, both for “suspicious circumstances,” according to a JPD call log.
Morrow denied having any involvement in drugs, but he wasn’t surprised by the accusation, which he said is a common refrain from Stokes. Morrow told Mississippi Today that Stokes has run off all Black businesses in the area and has failed to do anything to build up the community. 
Stokes is known for cruising the neighborhood in his white Chevy Suburban, scowling, several residents told Mississippi Today.
Johnson similarly keeps a look out. When she sees Daniel Cooper in the neighborhood, she alleges his conduct matches that of the other dealers she’s aware of in the area.
“It’s obvious that they’re doing something illegal because the cars come and go,” Johnson said, adding that people in the neighborhood frequently approach Cooper. “Who walks away with their hand closed up? Nobody.”
Resident Norma Michael, the Georgetown Community Neighborhood Association president and founder of the “Sharing is Caring” Neighborhood Block Garden, said she’s disappointed by the claims, for the message they send about her community. She told Mississippi Today that no one who attends the association’s meetings has complained about drug dealing in the neighborhood. 
Michael said it seems like Stokes’ is on a “witch hunt” because nearly every issue he has raised recently about the neighborhood seems to trace back to Cooper. 
“He has an obsession about it, and I can’t understand that,” she said. “Here’s a man trying to do something about the neighborhood. It’s no drugs, it’s no people hanging around (the food truck) drinking or smoking or things like that. It was a good thing to me.”

Cooper and his father, Roy Byram Cooper, argue their efforts have reduced crime in the neighborhood. Vagrants had taken up residence in an abandoned office building on their family lot before they demolished it. They said a house across the street was a high-traffic area with a frequent police presence until Daniel Cooper bought and renovated it. A WLBT news report even highlighted their progress in a recent feature. 
“If you had any evidence for the things you’re saying and accusing us, my son, of doing, then you should present it and we can move forward from that,” Roy Byram Cooper told Mississippi Today. “He’s not giving us anything to defend. He’s just making accusations because of his position.”
Gabrielle Cooper, Daniel’s sister, said Stokes is using his power as a city official to harass her brother, turning what is a family matter into a public issue. 
“The council might just ignore him,” she said. “But there are people who are listening, and it’s your responsibility to say something regardless of if you feel like he’s just talking.”

A family dispute
Stokes’ screed against Daniel Cooper also deals with the ownership status of the property where Georgetown Grub resides.
The parcel has been in the Cooper family name for decades. Daniel Cooper’s grandfather, Roy Cooper, repaired air-conditioning units and owned a two-story building that housed several family businesses – a beauty salon, an ice cream parlor and a brass exchange company. 
Daniel Cooper’s father, Roy Byram Cooper, also went into the HVAC trade and helped his father maintain the property. Now 71, Roy Byram Cooper told Mississippi Today he takes pride in working with his hands, one time writing his name into sidewalk concrete he poured outside the building. 
“The other kids, they had their own careers and other things they were doing,” Roy Byram Cooper said of his siblings. “See, Daddy and I were blue collar.”
But after Roy Cooper died in 2012, the building fell into disrepair and the ownership of the lot into limbo. He has many heirs, but a court would need to establish the shares to which they’re entitled, and that hasn’t happened yet. 
Stokes told Mississippi Today during the reporting of this story that he was working with an attorney to initiate that process, but the Coopers’ attorney beat him to it, filing a petition Thursday to open the estate.
Still, the councilman has gone around boasting that he owns the property. 
“I’ll tell you this, if Mr. Cooper owned it, I own it,” Stokes said recently, taunting a few of Cooper’s friends who were using the lot to pass out food the day before Thanksgiving. 
“Go to law school,” Stokes said when pressed for an explanation before driving away, according to a video recording.

Roy Bryam Cooper says he has never gotten along with Stokes. The councilman says the same, calling his brother-in-law a “bad apple” and alleging he’s a dope dealer, too. 
But Stokes wasn’t acting out a vendetta until after Cooper-Stokes died in 2023, the brother-in-law said.
“If he wasn’t a councilman, it wouldn’t be no problem,” Roy Bryam Cooper said. “But because of him being a councilman, he knows people downtown. So he’s tried every avenue he can to try to shut it down.”
The Coopers also suspect that Stokes, whose family owns properties throughout the area, is out for a landgrab. 
For Stokes, some bitterness comes from his claim that he took out a loan years ago to pay the unpaid taxes on the property – at the request of his wife – so the Cooper family wouldn’t lose it to a tax sale. 
But he also says he doesn’t want the property. Rather, it’s the alleged drug activity – on property bearing his wife’s family name – that makes him so intent on shutting the food truck down.
“If people in these neighborhoods know that this is drug-related and everybody in these neighborhoods know that was my wife’s father’s property, you don’t think they would associate my wife’s good name with the negative activity taking place?” Stokes told Mississippi Today.

The Cooper family hasn’t collectively decided the future of their lot, hence the temporary restaurant. Daniel Cooper said they are waiting to see how the neighborhood develops. 
But Stokes’ allegations about his nephew’s conduct extend beyond the heirs property to just about every effort Daniel Cooper said he’s made to improve the community.
Daniel Cooper and his wife began buying property in Georgetown a decade ago. He said he uses one of the homes as a makeshift office and storage for maintenance supplies to take care of his rentals. 
He said he’s tried to bring positivity in other ways, too. Cooper and his friends took a small tractor to a block of nearby Crawford Street, a mostly wooded area, to rid the street of debris and trash. Volunteers use the Cooper lot to distribute toys and back-to-school supplies for young people in the neighborhood.
Stokes has referenced each of these endeavors, alleging the address of Cooper’s home office is a drug spot, that his nephew is recruiting young people in the neighborhood to deal drugs in exchange for bicycles and that his cleanup efforts are strictly a performance.
“We got to stop them from participating in cleanups, ‘cause they trying to clean their image,” Stokes said during a Nov. 4 council meeting. “If there’s going to be cleanups, I have an ordinance to come. It must be approved by the mayor or the CAO to make sure that the wrong element is not involved.”

Marshaling city resources 
Stokes’ efforts to expose the food truck began the very day his nephew placed the trailer on the lot last year, Daniel Cooper said.
Stokes began by claiming the business, co-owned by Daniel Cooper and his father, does not have permission to be there. He alleged Roy Byram Cooper fraudulently signed city paperwork using his deceased father’s name.
In fact, the lease agreement, obtained by Mississippi Today, was signed “Roy Cooper” by Roy Byram Cooper, who shares a name with his late father. 
While Stokes has failed to make his case to the city, he has repeatedly made this forgery allegation.
“I never heard of a dead person giving permission for people to use his property,” Stokes said at an Oct. 7 council meeting. 
Stokes also insisted to Mississippi Today that the Coopers acquired the food truck used from a “dope man that’s already in jail,” but the Coopers provided a check and receipt showing they purchased the trailer new from a manufacturer in Texas.

Roy Byram Cooper said he tried to ignore his brother-in-law’s antics. Over the last year, police have visited the food truck, “in droves,” Daniel Cooper said. When it came time to renew the business license this fall, he said the city planning department’s response was sluggish.
The Coopers eventually pushed back. In August, their attorney, John Hall, sent a letter to the city attorney and planning and development department noting his clients had faced roadblocks from the city despite satisfying its permitting and licensing requirements. 
“It has come to our attention that this inference stems from the actions of a member of the Jackson City Council who is acting under the color of his authority and law in a manner that exceeds his proper jurisdiction and violates my clients’ rights to due process and equal treatment under the law,” Hall wrote. 
Hall received no response, and Stokes did not stop. 
In response to Stokes’ complaints, Teeuwissen said he paid a visit to Georgetown Grub in mid-October. On a warm Friday afternoon, he sat in his car across the street and observed two people coming and going. One bought what appeared to be a drink and another seemed to buy food. Nothing out of the ordinary. 
When he reviewed the business file, it didn’t take long for Teewuissen to realize Stokes had a familial connection to the property. But he said he found no reason for the city to reject the business renewal.
“The I’s are dotted and the T’s are crossed,” Teeuwissen told Mississippi Today.
While the city was still contemplating the renewal, an unusual series of events transpired.

The mysterious Impala
First, a man, unrelated to anyone in this saga, was driving down Martin Luther King Jr. Drive days before Thanksgiving when his car engine died. He wrote his phone number and a message saying he’d be back, and then left that piece of paper on the driver’s window after pushing the broken-down Chevy Impala into an empty lot.
The lot belonged to Stokes. The councilman then hired a wrecker to tow the car blocks away, next to the food truck.
Hours later, volunteers with a group called Organized Gentlemen arrived at the Cooper lot for a Thanksgiving food drive and encountered the Impala. 
As the group of men, local law students and a judge dished plates of turkey, mac and cheese, and green beans, Stokes appeared. The councilman summoned the police to meet him and asked an officer to run the plates to see if the car was stolen. 
The confrontation put a damper on what had been a joyous event and made the people there to receive food feel uneasy, said Perry Thomas, a member of Organized Gentlemen.
“You could see their face change,” he said.

Thomas, wearing blue food-safe gloves, approached Stokes to inquire about the gray Impala and why Stokes had called the cops, according to a video recording. The councilman sat on the hood of another broken down car, a vintage Mercedes that belonged to Cooper’s grandfather, and answered by repeating: “FBI. FBI. FBI.” 
Police found the Impala was not stolen. Stokes told Mississippi Today he had the car towed because he was attempting to do gravel work on property where the car was left as part of his effort to build a museum for his late wife. 
Cooper said he believes Stokes was attempting to harass, or worse, entrap him. 
The following Monday, when Cooper’s cook arrived to open up the truck for the day, Stokes had maneuvered his SUV to block the lot’s entrance on Ludlow Avenue. 
Cooper, exasperated, called the cops. As he began to explain the problem, the arriving officer interjected, “I already know. We’ve been dealing with this for a while,” according to a recording obtained by Mississippi Today.
The officer told Stokes he couldn’t block the property because Cooper possessed all the proper paperwork. He would know: “We’ve had several officers to come out here and they’ve did several reports,” the officer said.
“Y’all have to work this out a better way than this,” he added. “Because this is going to cause somebody to get hurt.” 
Stokes’ antics may seem petty, but Cooper said he’s afraid of what might happen if someone takes his uncle seriously. Stokes is a city councilman who appears on the news, after all. 
If an idea that Cooper’s food truck is full of drugs prevails, Cooper said it’s not hard to imagine someone trying to rob his business. The same goes for his nearby office. Or what if the man who owned the Impala had spotted it on Cooper’s lot and gotten angry?
“It has you paranoid at all times, thinking that somebody might believe this junk,” Cooper said. “I just have to hope nothing that he’s trying to conspire to do works.”

Slang in city code
The clerk of council first read aloud Stokes’ “dope dealer” ordinance during the council meeting Nov. 18. Attendees laughed, but the other council members had no comment, and the meeting proceeded to other items. 
When Stokes brought the measure to a vote Dec. 2, he explained that in addition to problems in his neighborhood, his ordinance was also a nod to a recent FBI sting involving Mississippi Delta sheriffs, as well as a federal investigation that ensnared Jackson’s former mayor, a former Jackson council member and the Hinds County district attorney. 
The Jackson case doesn’t pertain to drugs, rather a development proposal, but District Attorney Jody Owens was quoted in the 2024 indictment as saying, “We can take dope boy money… but I need to clean it and spread it.”
After Stokes’ spiel, his council colleagues raised concerns: Should city employees shun family members they suspect of selling drugs? What if someone was convicted years ago and has reformed? How would the ordinance be enforced? 
“If you believe this city is that unsafe, we need to have a task force or something in place to do something with safety and security,” Ward 2 Councilwoman Tina Clay said after introducing an amendment to replace the term “dope” with “drug,” arguing city code should not contain slang. 
Her amendment failed, but two others passed: Only drug activity within the last year would count, and the ordinance would not violate or impose on federal law. The ordinance passed with all but Clay voting yes.

Not long after, Stokes spotted Cooper and his friend, Jeremy Harris, in the hallway through the glass of the chamber doors. The men had hoped to hear what Stokes was saying about them. Stokes left the meeting and summoned a Jackson Police Department assistant chief to deal with the men.
Out in the hallway, Harris asked Stokes if it’s illegal to attend a public meeting, to which Stokes responds: “It’s against the law to be a dope boy,” according to a video recording.
“I’m not a dope boy,” Harris told him. “Just ‘cause you said don’t mean it’s true.” 
The officer asked the pair to leave City Hall, and they didn’t put up a fight, Cooper said. Stokes moseyed back to his leather seat behind the dais. 
“I left the council chambers ‘cause the dope boys had showed up,” he announced, adding that he’d given Cooper’s office address to the sheriff, FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09115047/3X0A6630-e1765571045219.jpg,,,2025-12-12 15:57:34.779937

Attorneys general in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico announced this week an agreement reached in a lawsuit accusing Google of harming consumers who made purchases in the Google Play Store.
The agreement arose out of a 2023 class action antitrust lawsuit alleging Google monopolized app distribution and in-app billing services on some Android devices, according to the settlement website.
Most funds are expected to be distributed to people who made Play Store purchases between August 2016 and September 2023. Google is also expected to change its practices, the Kansas Attorney General’s Office said in a Friday news release.
“Google abused its control of the Android market, costing Kansans and harming Kansas businesses. With this settlement, we change how Google does business and give money back to Kansas citizens,” said Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach.
Notices to eligible recipients began going out Dec. 2.
Danedri Herbert, a spokeswoman for the office and state GOP chair, said the office’s best estimate was that 750,000 Kansans could be eligible for a settlement payment.
Eligible recipients will likely receive payments directly into their PayPal or Venmo accounts, and a claim form is not necessary in most cases. Payments can occur only after a judge gives the agreement final approval. A hearing is scheduled to take place April 30.
Consumers who do not want a payment and wish to bring a case of their own against Google must opt out of the settlement class online or in writing by Feb. 19. People who wish to object to the agreement must do so in writing by the same deadline.

(Photo courtesy of the Forward Party of Utah)The Forward Party of Utah’s unprecedented midterm preference poll has picked a winner to replace outgoing Sen. Dan Thatcher, of West Valley City, the state’s only third-party lawmaker, after he announced earlier this year his departure from the Republican Party. 
The party announced Friday — the same day Thatcher’s retirement from his District 11 seat became effective — that Emily Buss won the party’s preference poll. Party officials have formally submitted her name to Gov. Spencer Cox for official appointment. 
Buss, of Eagle Mountain, describes her background as “rooted in advocacy, policy, and research, with a focus on child welfare and social impact,” according to her candidate bio on the party’s website. 
Utah’s Forward Party introduces 5 candidates, lays out voting plan to replace Sen. Thatcher

“I’ve spent my life fighting for families and building programs that serve real needs in real communities,” her bio says. “Whether it’s creating resources for underserved youth, expanding access to support services, or partnering with local organizations, I know how to turn ideas into action, and action into outcomes.”
The Forward Party of Utah — a centrist party with the slogan “Not left. Not right. Forward” that coalesced when the state’s two centrist groups merged earlier this year — is an affiliate of the national Forward Party. 
To fill Thatcher’s midterm vacancy, the party held a first-of-its kind online voting system that used the approval voting method, which allows voters to vote for more than one candidate. The candidate with the highest number of total approvals is declared the winner. 
Uniquely, the Forward Party of Utah held an open election — allowing all registered voters in District 11 to vote, regardless of their party affiliation. Eligible candidates needed to pass a party background check, agree to sign a pledge supporting the Forward Party’s values, and commit to running for reelection in 2026 as a Forward Party candidate. 
Buss won the preference poll — which included online and paper voting — with 625 votes, or 47.21% approval percentage. A total of 2,308 votes were cast in the election by 1,324 voters.

Approval percentage is calculated by dividing the number of approvals a candidate received by the total number of ballots cast. It represents the percentage of voters who approved that
candidate. Because voters may approve more than one candidate, total approvals across all candidates will exceed the number of ballots cast.
Bass, in a prepared statement, expressed gratitude for voters’ support. 
“I am honored, surprised, and grateful to the voters of District 11 for placing their trust in me,” she said. “But this isn’t about me, this is about the people I represent. Together, we will work toward common sense solutions that will strengthen our communities, support our families, and bring a brighter future for District 11 and all Utahns. There is a lot to be done. Let’s get to work.”
Thatcher said representing District 11 Utahns for the past 15 years “has been my honor, and I am deeply grateful for the trust and partnership of my constituents.” He also thanked the party for “facilitating an open, transparent, and historic process with more participation than any replacement process in Utah history.”
“Seeing every registered voter in this district invited to participate gives me tremendous confidence in the future of our community and its leadership,” he said, while congratulating Buss and her constituents.
Utah Republican Party won’t challenge mid-term appointment
In October — when Thatcher first announced his planned retirement — Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Axson indicated that the GOP took issue with Thatcher’s party switching, and he did not rule out challenging the Forward Party of Utah’s first-of-its-kind replacement process. 
Utah senator announces he’s leaving the Republican party, joining Utah Forward Party

Prepared to fight if necessary, Thatcher and Forward Party leaders said Utah law is clearly on their side. When a midterm vacancy occurs in the Legislature, the law says “the governor shall fill the vacancy until the next regular general election by immediately appointing the person whose name was submitted by the party liaison of the same political party as the prior senator.”
Reached Friday, Axson told Utah News Dispatch the GOP would not challenge Buss’s appointment, though he said in a text message “there are certainly concerns to the process and situation which created this moment.” 
“We disagree with Thatcher’s action of pulling a fast one on voters by changing his affiliation,” Axson said. “We also disagree with the process used by the Forward Utah party but respect the law allows them to be the party filling the vacancy.”
So while Buss is set to become the Utah Legislature’s only third-party candidate during the 2026 general session scheduled to begin Jan. 20, the Utah GOP will be putting forward a Republican challenger in the 2026 election, when the remainder of Thatcher’s and now Buss’ term ends. 
“The Utah Republican Party looks forward to our Republican candidates engaging with voters this next year and for the district to have a chance to have a senator who represents the principles and preferences of the district,” Axson said. 
Phil Boileau, spokesperson for the Forward Party of Utah, told Utah News Dispatch that “we look forward to the competition in 2026.”
“If the people of the district choose that they prefer a Republican candidate at that time, then they will make that selection under the democratic system that we cherish and revere,” he said. 
Utah’s only third-party legislator says he intends to resign — but there’s a catch

To Axson’s comment about “pulling a fast one,” Boileau noted that while the Republican Party uses a “closed” system to pick its nominees (with only registered Republicans able to vote in the primary and delegates picking nominees during caucus meetings), the Forward Party of Utah opened its preference poll to all District 11 registered voters.
“Considering we had a process where literally everybody in the district could cast their vote and participate … I’m not sure that you can reasonably say that we pulled the fast one on the people,” he said. “We followed the law, and we created a system that was more inclusive, including the Republicans who were more than welcome to participate in the voting for this.” 
Boileau said leaders of the Forward Party of Utah were “thrilled” with how the election went, with more than 1,300 voters participating, which he said far exceeds the number of caucus delegates that likely would have participated in a typical party midterm replacement, which he estimated would have been up to 150 delegates.
He said he hopes the party’s preference poll can set an example for future elections, both in and outside of Utah. 
“As a new and upstart party, we took a big swing by doing this, but we followed state statute and protocol to the letter, so we fully expect not only that the state will accommodate the decision that we made,” he said. “We hope that people all around the country will look at this as an opportunity to maybe revise their midterm replacement processes as well.”

North Carolina legislators ready to close the book on 2025 and begin the holidays received a sobering reminder of how much work awaits when they return in the new year.
Billy Lassiter, deputy secretary with the Division of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, told members of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Justice and Public Safety on Thursday that North Carolina has seen an increase of over 14% in juvenile delinquency complaints between 2022 and 2024.
That represents more than 40,000 complaints against 14,189 juveniles this past year.

Simple assault is the number one complaint brought against juveniles, often occurring in a school setting. But Lassiter said what’s new is the rise in vehicle break-ins and motor vehicle thefts.
“It’s not that they’re breaking into one car – they’re breaking into multiple cars at one time,” Lassiter told lawmakers. “And what is the number one thing that they’re trying to steal from your car? Firearms.”
Lassiter, who has worked in juvenile justice for 27 years, said gun owners are making it far too easy for juveniles to get their hands on a weapon.
“60% of those cars were not even locked. So, when we say breaking and entering, there wasn’t much breaking going on,” Lassiter shared. “Most of those guns were not secured in the vehicle. They were sitting right there on the front seat of the car for those young people to get access to.”
There were nearly 11,000 guns stolen from North Carolina citizens in 2024.
Juveniles are also more likely to be armed while committing a crime than in the past. Four years ago, just 4% of the juvenile crimes in North Carolina involved a firearm. Last year, it was almost 15%.

Lassiter said lawmakers could help by providing recurring funding for the NC S.A.F.E. campaign, which provides gun locks and messaging to remind firearm owners how to safely store their firearms in their house. Of all the school shootings across the country, 80% of the guns came from the child’s own home.
Lassiter said the department also needs more staff for the state’s juvenile detention centers.
A change in the law in 2020 requires that any child under the age of 18 facing adult charges be housed in a juvenile detention facility until they’ve been convicted of those adult charges.
With the slow-moving justice system, many of those young people are staying in juvenile detention centers now for almost 200 days.
“It’s not just that we’re getting more young people, it’s that those young people that we’re getting are staying much longer in the facilities. And that’s driving the population to go higher and higher,” Lassiter explained.
The North Carolina Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission is expected to release data Friday projecting the state won’t have enough beds at its youth development centers to serve the young people who need to be housed.
In 2023, the General Assembly granted Lassiter’s department approval to build another 48-bed facility. But because no  state budget passed this year, no funding is available to continue that project.

“We desperately need those beds so that we can get kids off the floor in these facilities,” he stressed.
“You contract with local jails, right?” asked Rep. Carson Smith (R-Pender) hoping to ease the housing shortage.
Lassiter explained that under federal law, juveniles must have sight and sound separation from adult inmates to protect them  from physical or sexual abuse, and few local jails are set up to meet that requirement.
In addition to a place to sleep, Lassiter told the oversight committee that many of North Carolina’s juveniles need wraparound services.
Thirty-eight percent of the juveniles who were involved in the system last year had a mental health diagnosis. And 50% of them had five or more mental health challenges.
“Last year, 36% of our kids that came into the system had parents that said they were unwilling or incapable of taking care of their own kids,” Lassiter said.
Juvenile Crime Prevention Councils (JCPCs) in each county work to develop strategies on delinquency prevention that involve the full family, not just the child. Programs like conflict resolution, counseling, family therapy and community service can help change the trajectory of a troubled youth’s life, Lassiter said..
“How do those recidivism rates compare with adult recidivism rates?” Sen. Norm Sanderson (R-Pamlico) asked.
“Overall, the juvenile justice recidivism rate is about 15% lower than the adult recidivism rate,” said Lassiter. “In general, we get better results.”
But these programs have not had an increase in their daily rate since 2020, he added. Without additional funding in the near future, service providers will be forced to reduce their services.
Lassiter said for every dollar invested in a community-based program, research has shown the state gets $70 in return.
“That’s what we’re doing by investing in these community-based programs – we’re investing in our young people so they don’t break into your house or my car next week,” he said. “We need the programming in these local communities.”

(KOSU File Photo)The executive director of Oklahoma City’s chapter of Black Lives Matter has been accused of embezzling more than $3 million meant to cover bail for Oklahomans detained in one of the country’s deadliest jails.
Prosecutors say BLM OKC executive director Tashella Sheri Amore Dickerson, 52, deposited at least $3.15 million in returned bail checks into her personal accounts.
Black Lives Matter had raised the funds to post pretrial bail for people arrested during racial justice protests in Oklahoma City after the 2020 murder of George Floyd. The indictment said much of the money was properly used at that time.
However, when a person’s case was adjudicated, and money was returned to BLM, instead of creating a revolving fund for people who couldn’t pay bail in the future, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges Dickerson deposited it into her personal accounts and into those of a company she controlled.

The jail in Oklahoma County, where the chapter is based, has long been cited for chronic understaffing, repeated health inspection failuresand a high number of deaths, including suicides.
“The Oklahoma County jail is known as a place that is totally inhumane,” Dickerson told The Oklahoman in 2020.
“The community has really stepped up and said, ‘We got you.’ Being able to support one another is epic,” she said to the newspaper.
The indictment said that support was not used to secure people’s release from jail, as donors intended. Instead, the money was used to pay for recreational travel to the Caribbean, a personal vehicle, six real estate purchases and tens of thousands of dollars in retail spending.
In a live video posted on her Facebook page Thursday afternoon, Dickerson reassured friends and family that she’s doing OK.
“This is not a formal comment,” she said. “I’m not giving a comment. All I am saying is that I’m letting my family and my friends and everyone that has been pouring into me know that I’m alright.”
“A lot of times when people come at you with these types of things … it’s evidence that you are doing the work,” she continued. “And so that is what I’m standing on.”
BLM OKC was not a registered 501(c)(3) organization under the Internal Revenue Code, which meant it could not accept donations from individuals or via grants, the indictment said. An Arizona-based nonprofit, Alliance for Global Justice, collected donations on its behalf.
In grant reports to the Alliance for Global Justice, Dickerson is accused of providing false information and failing to report her actions properly.
She faces 20 counts of wire fraud and five counts of money laundering, which, if convicted, could lead to decades in prison.
The Associated Press reported in October that the Department of Justice is investigating leaders in the BLM movement for defrauding the tens of millions of dollars it garnered during protests in 2020. A spokesperson for the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation did not comment on the allegations against Dickerson, but said the movement uses a decentralized leadership model.
“The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation operates independently from local chapters, and the local chapters operate independently of the Foundation,” the spokesperson said. “The Foundation remains committed to transparency and integrity, and disrupting what philanthropy looks like in service of Black people.”

Andrew Wolfe, 24, of Martinsburg, West Virginia, was shot on Nov. 26, 2025, while on mission with the West Virginia National Guard in Washington, D.C. (Photo courtesy of Joint Task Force-District of Columbia)A member of the West Virginia National Guard who was wounded in what law enforcement officials call a “targeted” attack” in Washington D.C. last month is improving, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Thursday.
Melody Wolfe, mother of U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, said her son was smiling, moving more of the right side of his body and sitting in a chair for hours, the governor conveyed during a news conference. Wolfe has also been communicating, though not verbally, Morrisey said. 
“Melanie and Jason are deeply appreciative for the hospital staff and for all the prayers that have come throughout West Virginia and across the country,” the governor said. 
Wolfe, 24, of Martinsburg, West Virginia, and U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of Webster Springs, were ambushed Nov. 26 while on duty blocks from the White House while hundreds of Guard members were in D.C. for President Donald Trump’s “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.”
Beckstrom died of her wounds on Thanksgiving. She was laid to rest in a ceremony at the West Virginia National Cemetery in Grafton earlier this week. Wolfe remains in the hospital with severe wounds. 
Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, was charged with one count of murder after the attack on the Guard members, as well as two counts of assault with the intent to kill, and a count of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Lakanwal pleaded not guilty.
A West Virginia veteran has called for Beckstrom and Wolfe to receive the Purple Heart award.
In a video the National Guard posted to social media on Sunday, Melody Wolfe said her son had been active and alert. 
“He’s coming along well, surpassing expectations,” she said in the video. “All the prayers that you’ve given, they’re working and we’re seeing that miracle happen in that hospital bed right now.” 
Morrisey said Thursday that Wolfe’s parents’ one request has been for prayers for their son. The governor cautioned that while Wolfe’s parents are optimistic, Wolfe has an “intense rehabilitation” period ahead of him. 
“[Prayers are] working, and I think mom and dad are grateful for the support so many West Virginians have shown during this difficult time,” Morrisey said.

Rhode Island’s bidding process drew no applicants before Monday, when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) suddenly withdrew its controversial plan to overhaul its Continuum of Care program, worth nearly $4 billion in grants.
R.I. judge calls HUD move to rescind funding notice right before court hearing ‘intentional chaos’

That’s because HUD never began accepting applications to its online portal e-snaps, leaving Rhode Island’s network of care providers with no blueprint on how to comply with the federal government’s changes.
“It was really crazy,” Michelle Wilcox, CEO and president of Crossroads Rhode Island, a lead plaintiff in one of the lawsuits against the administration, said in an interview. “People were obsessively checking the e-snaps site to see if it had opened — and it had not.”
HUD’s federal funding rules are typically made in the late summer, with ample runway given for local providers to shape their grant proposals that Rhode Island’s Continuum of Care formally submits to the federal government. 
The Trump administration instead issued a funding notice for the federal fiscal year 2025 grants on Nov. 13, the day the federal government reopened from the longest shutdown in U.S. History. 
Federal housing officials had planned to divert 60% of the funding historically dedicated to “Housing First” programs like permanent supportive units, which provide long-term housing with no preconditions, toward temporary transitional housing.
Grant rules also would have eliminated funding for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely.
Critics warned the Trump administration’s changes would jeopardize the housing of more than 170,000 people across the nation, including over 1,000 in Rhode Island. 
“This complete 180 from HUD of deviating from Housing First would have forced all of us to completely upend our business model of how we deliver supportive housing to the populations that we serve,” said Lisa Guillette, executive director of Foster Forward, the East Providence social services agency that assists young people as they age out of foster care.
Foster Forward was awarded $520,000 in Continuum of Care grants during the most recent federal fiscal year, funds Guillette stated went mostly toward rental assistance for youth as part of its rapid rehousing program. 
HUD’s notice had set an application deadline of Jan. 14, 2026.
That tight timeframe led Rhode Island’s Continuum of Care to issue a request for proposals on Nov. 21 from providers who work with unhoused populations, with the local deadline of 3 p.m. Friday, Dec. 12 in order to review grant applications before final submission.
“The turnaround on this was going to be really untenable,” Guillette said.
How long it will take the federal agency to reissue a new grant funding notice, along with what conditions it will include, is unknown. A HUD spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
A statement on the department’s Continuum of Care Program website only notes that a new grant application announcement would go out “well in advance of the deadline for obligation of available Fiscal Year 2025 funds.”
In an 85-page lawsuit against HUD, nonprofits led by the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition state that programs across the country have grants expiring as soon as January.
For Guillette, among her first programs up for renewal will be in the spring. Wilcox said Crossroads, the largest homeless service provider in the state, doesn’t see its first permanent supportive housing grant program expire until late into the next year.
But the lack of a timeline from HUD still makes it difficult for Rhode Island’s homeless care providers to properly forecast their future budgets and pay lease renewals for existing permanent supportive housing units.
“We need to know what the funding is for next year,” said Wilcox, whose organization received $2.1 million in grants for federal fiscal year 2024. “These aren’t programs that we can just flip a switch and turn them on and off — a lot of the dollars go into leasing and rents.”

The case was first dismissed in 2023 by the Menominee County Circuit Court. The Court of Appeals heard the case in October, after which they denied the writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that chimpanzees are not “persons” under the law.
In their decision, the appellate court wrote that “only our Supreme Court may revise that common law principle,” referencing the argument from Nonhuman Rights Project lawyers that common law, as opposed to a specific statute referencing a person, should apply in this case.

“This proceeding arises from the Attorney General’s investigation into Colorado compliance with federal election law, particularly the (National Voting Rights Act) and HAVA,” the lawsuit says.
The U.S. attorney general is Pam Bondi.

The DOJ has now sued 18 states over the issue, including four on Thursday. Fifteen of those states voted for Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in the 2024 presidential election. The department has requested voter registration information from at least 40 states.
The DOJ first asked Colorado for voter registration records on May 12. In November, after federal officials acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter information with the Department of Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens as a way to “scrub aliens from voter rolls,” Griswold joined a group of other secretaries of state to ask Bondi and the department if it misled them about how voter information would be used.
On Dec. 1, officials once again asked the state for the records via email and proposed a memorandum of understanding that the DOJ believed “cures all potential concerns a state might rightfully raise regarding its citizens’ private data and identifying information,” according to an email cited in the lawsuit. Griswold responded that she would not send the voter files.
“We will not hand over Coloradans’ sensitive voting information to Donald Trump,” Griswold said in a statement. “He does not have a legal right to the information. I will continue to protect our elections and democracy, and look forward to winning this case.”
Besides asserting that the administration is not legally entitled to the information it seeks, Griswold and other election officials have expressed concern about the security of sensitive voter data if they release it to federal agencies, and they have questioned the administration’s motives.
“Is the administration collecting in an unprecedented way mass voter data and dumping it into an untested, unverified federal system to spread voter disinformation — disinformation to undermine our elections?” Griswold said last month.
Griswold has already given publicly available Colorado voter information to the DOJ.
The lawsuit requests the voter information within five days of a court order. It claims the DOJ has broad power to request the information through the Civil Rights Act from 1960.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)More special elections are being set in Virginia’s legislature as a growing number of Democratic lawmakers depart the House of Delegates to join the incoming administration of Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger or pursue higher office.
On Friday, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, scheduled special elections for Jan. 13 in House Districts 11 and 23, following the resignations of two veteran Democratic delegates tapped for Spanberger’s cabinet.
In House District 11, Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, stepped down after being named Virginia’s next secretary of natural and historic resources. Bulova, first elected to the House in 2006, built a reputation as a consensus-builder on environmental issues, working across party lines on legislation related to land conservation, clean energy and water quality.
House District 23 was vacated by Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, who resigned after Spanberger selected her to serve as secretary of the commonwealth. Mundon King, first elected in 2021, has focused much of her legislative work on voting access, maternal health and consumer protection.
The two Jan. 13 contests add to a growing list of special elections triggered by Democratic turnover in the House ahead of the 2026 session. 
Earlier this week, Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, resigned his seat in House District 77 after winning the Democratic nomination to succeed Lt. Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi in Senate District 15. A special election to fill Jones’ House seat has already been scheduled for Jan. 6.
So far, only Democrats have announced bids in the three Democratic-leaning districts.
In House District 11, Bulova’s wife, Gretchen Bulova, is the only candidate who has publicly announced a campaign, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. However, Susan Weltz, chair of the district’s Democratic Committee, said the party will hold a firehouse primary Tuesday, Dec. 16, to select its nominee.
“We look forward to an informative campaign that will give voters in the district a chance to vote for whom they wish to see representing them in the General Assembly, and then we must all unite in support of the eventual Democratic nominee, whoever it may be,” Weltz said in a statement.
In House District 23, Margaret Franklin has announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination. No Republican candidates have declared in the district.
House District 77 is already drawing a crowded Democratic field. Three candidates are competing in a firehouse primary scheduled for Sunday: former Richmond Ccity Ccouncil member Michelle Mosby, Greg Powers, and attorney Charles Schmidt.
The series of special elections underscores the ripple effects of Spanberger’s transition into office, as well as the political maneuvering underway ahead of the 2026 legislative session, which is set to start Jan. 14. 
While Democrats hold a comfortable 63-37 majority in the House of Delegates, the outcome of the special elections will determine whether their significant advantage remains intact as lawmakers return to Richmond.

Contango Ore, the mining company developing the prospect, announced a merger this week with a Canadian firm. (Max Graham/Northern Journal)A Fairbanks-based company with several Alaska mining projects, including two near Anchorage, could nearly double in size in a proposed merger with a Canadian firm.
The deal, announced this week, would combine Contango Ore with Vancouver-based Dolly Varden Silver Corp. It’s the latest in a recent flurry of deals in the global mining industry, including in Alaska.
Contango is involved in multiple high-profile projects in Alaska, including the already operating Manh Choh mine in the Interior. It’s also doing substantial exploratory work at two other prospects — one in Hatcher Pass, above the Mat-Su, and another on Indigenous-owned land surrounded by a national park southwest of Anchorage that’s drawn sharp opposition.
The merged company would be called Contango Silver & Gold and would control both companies’ assets.
Contango and Dolly Varden are touting the deal as a step toward becoming a bigger, multibillion-dollar business. Once combined, their executives said, they’d have deeper pockets — though the new company would still be geared mainly toward exploration and would need several years to build producing mines.
“We had a good five-year plan, and now we’ve got a good 20-year business,” Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, Contango Ore’s chief executive, said on a call with investors after the announcement.
There are no expected changes to Contango’s plans for its Alaska projects, and the company would remain based in Fairbanks, Van Nieuwenhuyse said later in a phone interview. A longtime player in the state’s mining industry, Van Nieuwenhuyse would become chief executive of the merged company.
Contango is perhaps best known for its unconventional development model, which involves shipping minimally processed ore to other mines rather than building its own storage areas for potentially toxic tailings.
It’s also known for helping launch Manh Choh, near the town of Tok. The company owns a 30% stake in that mine, which trucks ore some 250 miles on state highways to a processing plant at another Interior mine, Fort Knox. The state of Alaska, through the Permanent Fund, invested $10 million in Contango in 2021.
Beyond Manh Choh, the company is pushing the Johnson Tract project, a gold, zinc, copper, lead and silver deposit beneath an Indigenous-owned inholding in Lake Clark National Park — on the remote west side of Cook Inlet.
That project has fueled concerns from commercial fishermen, environmental groups and tribal governments over potential environmental impacts and the project’s proximity to the national park and prime wildlife habitat, including for endangered beluga whales in an area called Tuxedni Bay.
Its other significant prospect is named Lucky Shot. At that project, in the scenic Hatcher Pass area north of Anchorage, Contango is trying to revamp a historic underground gold mine.
Dolly Varden’s focus, meanwhile, has been a large exploratory silver mine in British Columbia, called Kitsault Valley, near the border with Southeast Alaska.
Though Dolly Varden doesn’t currently operate in Alaska, one of its top shareholders is Hecla Mining Co., which runs the huge Greens Creek silver mine in the Juneau area. (Hecla owns some 13% of Dolly Varden, according to financial disclosures.)
Industry observers say deals like this one are common among small mining firms, known as juniors. What they portend for a company’s prospects, however, can be challenging for outsiders to parse.
“It‘s part of the mysterious, impenetrable workings of the churnings of junior mining companies,” Bob Loeffler, an industry consultant and research professor of public policy at the University of Alaska Anchorage’s Institute of Social and Economic Research, said in an email.
The deal comes just a few weeks after a different Vancouver-based company announced the sale of a contentious copper and zinc project in Southeast Alaska. It also comes a few months after the multinational company that operates Northwest Alaska’s massive Red Dog mine, Teck Resources, agreed to merge with another global mining firm, Anglo American.
In the call with investors, Van Nieuwenhuyse and Dolly Varden’s chief executive, Shawn Khunkhun, said they would continue to advance both the Johnson Tract and Lucky Shot prospects.
Johnson Tract opponents say they’ll continue to fight the project. The proposed merger indicates Contango is focused on “vanity metals” like gold and silver, rather than “critical minerals,” Cooper Freeman, Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.
Gold and silver “do nothing for humanity but plunder spectacular places like Lake Clark National Park and Tuxedni Bay for corporate profit,” he added.
The merger is not expected to be finalized until February or March, Contango said in a press release.

(Photo by Eli Voorhies for Washington State Standard)As rivers began to recede, the federal government on Friday approved Washington’s request for aid to respond to ongoing record flooding.
Gov. Bob Ferguson said he received a call from U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to let him know that President Donald Trump had signed Ferguson’s request for an emergency declaration. This will allow the state to seek federal funds in response to the flooding.
“I expressed my thanks to Secretary Noem on behalf of the people of the State of Washington during this extremely challenging time,” Ferguson said in a statement.
Around midnight, the Skagit River crested at a record 37.7 feet near Mount Vernon, surpassing the mark set in 1990. The flooding didn’t quite hit the peaks in the city that some officials were warning of, and that could have toppled the city’s floodwall. 
After thousands of Skagit County residents were directed to evacuate their homes Wednesday and Thursday, authorities early Friday morning told thousands more in Burlington to leave immediately due to a flooding slough. 
Members of Washington’s National Guard were going door to door to let residents know they should evacuate from the city, though some were allowed to return hours later. Officials lifted evacuation orders in some other areas, as well, including Orting in Pierce County, which sits between the Carbon and Puyallup rivers.
The National Guard was also helping in swift water rescues in Burlington. In all, more than 300 members of the National Guard were assisting in Skagit County. California Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed search and rescue teams to Washington to help. 
The Snohomish River has also set a new flooding record. Both the Skagit and Snohomish were forecast to remain in the major flooding stage into Saturday. Rivers as far east as the Yakima in Benton County were flooding at least moderately.
People congregate at a flood wall in Mount Vernon on Dec. 11, 2025, with some climbing up to get a view of the surging Skagit River, despite posted warnings. Police routinely came by to kick people off and one officer commented that all it takes is one slip for things to go wrong. (Photo by Eli Voorhies for Washington State Standard)
Some major highways remain closed, including a long stretch of U.S. 2 between Skykomish and Leavenworth. 
There were concerns that Washington may have trouble accessing federal assistance to respond to the flooding, given Trump’s posture on disaster aid. The Republican president has appeared to favor GOP-led states for this help. 
This year, he denied Washington’s request for federal aid in the aftermath of the devastating bomb cyclone windstorm that hit the state late last year.
On Wednesday, Ferguson, a Democrat, asked for a statewide emergency declaration from the feds. 
This emergency declaration covers Benton, Chelan, Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, King, Kittitas, Lewis, Mason, Pierce, Skagit, Snohomish, Thurston, Wahkiakum, Whatcom and Yakima counties, along with tribal nations in those areas.

“Thank you for the fast emergency declaration,” Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, said on social media. “Thank you for helping respond to our infrastructure needs. Thank you for supporting our first responders. Thank you!”
Ferguson is planning to host a press conference at a levee in Tukwila on Friday afternoon. He’s set to be joined by new King County Executive Girmay Zahilay, state Adjutant General Gent Welsh and Robert Ezelle, director of the Military Department’s Emergency Management Division.

California’s unemployment department bought more cellphones than it needed for remote work during the COVID pandemic and kept paying for thousands of unused lines.


California’s unemployment agency kept paying cellphone bills for four and a half years without checking whether its workers were actually using the devices.
That’s how it racked up $4.6 million in fees for mobile devices its workers were not using, according to a new state audit detailing wasteful spending at several government agencies. 
The Employment Development Department’s excessive cellphone bills date to the COVID-19 pandemic, when it shifted call center employees to remote work and faced pressure to release benefits to millions of suddenly unemployed Californians.
It acquired 7,224 cellphones and wireless hotspots by December 2020. State auditors analyzed 54 months of invoices since then and found half the devices were unused for at least two years, 25% were unused for three years and 99 of them were never used at all. 
The investigation, which auditors opened after receiving a tip, identified 6,285 devices that were unused for at least four consecutive months, and said the department spent $4.6 million on monthly service fees for them.
From the beginning, the department had about 2,000 more cellphones than call center employees, according to the audit. The gap widened over time after the pandemic ended and the department’s staffing returned to its normal headcount.
As of April, the audit said the department had 1,787 unemployment call center employees, but was paying monthly service fees for 5,097 mobile devices. 
“Although obtaining the mobile devices during COVID-19 may have been a good idea to serve the public, continuing to pay the monthly service fees for so many unused devices, especially post-COVID-19, was wasteful,” the audit said. 
Department officials told auditors they were unaware of the spending, but auditors pointed to regular invoices from Verizon that showed which phones were not being used. 
“We would have expected EDD management to have reconsidered the need to pay the monthly service fees for so many devices that had no voice, message, or data usage,” the audit said.

The unemployment department began acting on the auditors’ findings in April, when it canceled service plans for 2,825 devices. It has since implemented a policy to terminate service plans for devices that go unused for 90 days. 
The California state auditor highlighted the mobile devices in its regular report on “improper activities by state agencies and employees.” The audit also showed that the California Air Resources Board overpaid an employee who was on extended leave as he prepared to retire by $171,000.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/011022-EDD-Sacramento-MG-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-12 14:57:36.270893

According to the December edition of the Fiscal Year 2026 General Fund Budget Monitor report released Thursday by the nonpartisan Idaho Legislative Services Office, Idaho’s state budget is projected to end the current fiscal year 2026 on June 30 with a deficit of $40.3 million. That number includes the 3% budget holdbacks that Gov. Brad Little ordered in August, as well as the latest revenue collections that the state took in in November.
The projected budget deficit has shrunk from an estimated $58.3 million last month to $40.3 million this month, according to the Legislative Services Office. 
Idaho budget writers prepare to enter new era of trimming state budgets

The projected budget deficit is important because the Idaho Constitution prohibits the state from running a budget deficit and requires the state to pass a balanced budget. 
Idaho state legislators and officials in the governor’s office have vowed that they will intervene during the 2026 legislative session that starts Jan. 12 to prevent the state from running a budget deficit. Although their tactics have not been made public, the most likely tools they will use to balance the budget appear to include enacting additional new budget cuts and/or dipping into more than $1 billion in state rainy day reserve accounts.
It is important to note that the projected budget deficit is not a hiccup limited to the current year. State budget officials have projected a much larger budget deficit of $555.2 million for next year’s budget, fiscal year 2027. The state’s top budget official, Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff told the Idaho Capital Sun the state may need to come up with an additional $600 million to $1 billion for the 2027 budget if the state wants to conform with federal tax changes championed by President Donald Trump and also leave an ending cash balance to serve as a budget cushion to guard against additional budget uncertainty. 
 Idaho officials sounding alarms over budget shortfalls

During a closely watched state tax conference in Boise last week, Republican Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke sounded an alarm about the state budget situation, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Idaho Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke is sworn in on the steps of the State Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
“For the first time in Idaho’s history, (in) last year’s budgeting session, we acted more like Washington, D.C., than we did Idaho,” Bedke said earlier this month. “… We created a list of things that we wanted to accomplish and passed that list of things before we set the revenue number, and then we backed into the list with the revenue number, and adjusted the revenue number to pay for that list of things.” 
The projected state budget shortfall is occurring after years of tax cuts approved by the Idaho Legislature. A recent report from the Boise-based nonprofit Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy says the state reduced revenue by a cumulative total of $4 billion over the past five years to pay for income tax cuts. The Idaho Center For Fiscal Policy said those income tax cuts benefitted businesses and the wealthiest Idahoans earning more than $738,300 per year much more than average Idaho working families and families with low incomes. 
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said the budget shortfall was entirely created by the Idaho Legislature. In an interview Friday morning, Rubel called for repealing the most recent income tax cut and a new education tax credit that the Idaho Legislature created in 2025 to pay families for education expenses that include tuition at private, religious schools.
“If we came in and reversed some of that and restored revenue, honestly most people wouldn’t even notice,” Rubel said, adding that the income tax cuts and the education tax credit primarily benefit wealthy families. “We have a revenue problem; we don’t have a spending problem. But unfortunately what I think the Legislature is going to do is move in the other direction and exacerbate all of this with even more tax cuts.”

Rubel said she is afraid the Idaho Legislature will enact deep new budget cuts to avoid a budget shortfall, which she fears will have significant negative consequences. She pointed out Idaho sheriffs are already issuing public warnings that mental health cuts will pose significant public safety concerns. 
“The repercussions of the cuts will be felt far beyond the vulnerable communities who took the hit on the front end,” Rubel said. “It’s going to hit regular people. It’s going to hit them a lot harder in the very near future, and they are going to want answers.” 
Rubel also said some legislators are not being forthcoming about how serious the budget situation is and the root causes that created it.
“Unfortunately what we are seeing is just a lot of gas-lighting,” Rubel said. “The people driving us into the ditch are still holding the keys to the car, and they’re telling people what a beautiful ditch it is. It appears they don’t have the appetite to admit they maybe made a mistake and we need to take a different direction.”
 Idaho’s decision on ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ tax cuts will have a big impact on the budget and 2026 legislative session

Idaho’s projected state budget deficit does not include the cost of conforming to the tax changes in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law on July 4. 
The Idaho Legislature will get to decide whether and how to conform with those tax changes during the upcoming 2026 legislative session. If the Republican-controlled Idaho Legislature follows Trump’s lead and conforms with the tax changes, it could reduce state revenue by an additional $284 million in 2026, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation. 
Some of Trump’s individual tax changes include no tax on workers’ tips, no tax on workers’ overtime pay, no tax on borrowers’ car loan interest and a temporary expanded deduction for senior citizens. 
If the Idaho Legislature chooses to conform with the tax changes, that would reduce state revenue available for the state budget. If the Idaho Legislature does not conform with the tax changes, the state would deviate from Trump and the federal government and collect state taxes in those areas. 
Rubel told the Sun on Friday that after meeting with Republican leaders she believes the Idaho Legislature will conform with Trump’s tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Last month, state Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, told the Sun that it may not make financial sense for Idaho to comply with all of the business tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed. 
Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee co-chair Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, directs committee business at the Idaho State Capitol building on Jan. 11, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
“This year conformity could have a very high price tag,” Horman told the Sun on Nov. 25.
“Normally we just conform with the federal policies. This year will be different because of the Big Beautiful Bill — there is no tax on tips, there is no tax on overtime, but there are also substantial tax cuts for business. In my opinion, it makes no sense to set a revenue number (for the budget) until we know what the conformity policy is going to look like. As you know, JFAC does not set revenue policy – the tax committees set the policies that will determine the amount of eligible revenue to appropriate. So this is a unique year in that conformity could have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and there will be important policy decisions that need to be made outside of JFAC before we will really know how much revenue will be on the table for appropriation.”
Efforts to reach Horman on Friday morning were not immediately successful. But Horman has consistently downplayed the state’s projected budget deficit as merely an estimate on a piece of paper and a guess. 
Horman has also vowed to prevent the state from running a deficit.
“We will set a balanced budget,” Horman told the Sun on Nov. 13.  “The constitution requires it. I am personally committed to it. And I anticipate we will leave as large of a cash balance as we can to carry over into next year to guard against unforeseen circumstances.”
Horman is co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee – or JFAC, for short – which sets every budget for every state agency and department every year. 
Idaho is not alone in facing a state revenue and budget shortfalls. The Colorado Legislature called a special session in August to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget, Colorado Newsline reported. Additionally, the states of Arizona, New Mexico and Maryland are projecting tax changes from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce state revenues in their states, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trusts.

A federal judge halted a large logging project near Yellowstone National Park because he said the United States Forest Service submitted plans that made it impossible to judge how it would affect critical grizzly bear habitat.
The 16,500-acre project located in the Custer Gallatin National Forest would have allowed the U.S. Forest Service to select timber and build roads for logging, but without offering specifics, only pledging that its plans would consider the total distance of the roads and not exceed certain parameters in acreage size, designed to protect critical bear habitat.
However, Judge Donald W. Molloy said that the plans amounted to giving the Forest Service permission and trusting that it would be compliant later. He also said in a 46-page ruling released Thursday that the plans also made it difficult to judge how the logging project would impact grizzly habitat, and that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said a female grizzly’s minimum range was 10 acres, while not basing that decision on any cited science.
Meanwhile the groups that challenged the logging project, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Wild Earth Guardians and the Western Environmental Law Center, pointed to other research that indicated as many as 2,500 acres were needed.
Molloy also vacated the Forest Service’s project because it failed to comply with several different portions of federal law, including the National Forest Management Act.
“(The groups) argue that this approach conflates a promise of future statutory compliance with actual compliance. (They) insist that it is impossible to assess the true environmental impacts of the project under the National Environmental Policy Act, or determine whether it meets statutory or forest plan protections for grizzly bears and lynx under the Endangered Species Act and the NFMA,” Molloy said.
The judge agreed the Forest Service failed to properly consider the impacts of the logging project on the grizzly bears. While the Forest Service, in its plans, said that it would be approving 56.8 miles of temporary roads associated with the project, it said those would be determined during the project, based on other conditions.
However, the groups had argued one of the biggest factors in grizzly bear habitats is their proximity to roads. Grizzly bears, according to the scientific testimony presented in the case, tend to avoid and settle in habitats far away from roads, and that humans are the largest threat to grizzly bear survival.
In the lawsuit, the groups argued it wasn’t just the total number or length of the roads that mattered, but also the placement. Because the Forest Service plans gave no specifics on the location of the roads, Molloy said it was impossible to judge the impacts on the bears.
“Essentially while the Forest Service’s math check out, it is unclear how the Forest Service can calculate the amount of secure habitat that will be lost without first determining where the temporary roads will be routed,” Molloy said in his ruling.
Furthermore, the judge agreed that approving the project would have meant the true extent of the project could not be calculated until after the project, leaving the groups with few legal remedies.
“Here, however in the context of grizzly bear secure habitation, the lack of specific road mapping prevents such informed decision making,” Molloy said. “The Forest Service avowing that future activities will comply with NFMA falls far short of showing that those actives do so.”
The court also said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service relied on using a grizzly 10-acre patch size for habitat was consistent, but officials provided no science or basis for that size, while the groups cited other scientific research that calls for much more, and highlights the importance of that land in relation to roads for motorized vehicles.
“The U.S. Forest Service identify no specific explanation of why 10 acres, as opposed to 1 acre, 5 acres or 50 acres is an appropriate metric,” Molloy said.
The conservation groups cheered the ruling.
“This ruling makes it clear that agencies can’t just rubber-stamp massive logging projects and promise to sort out the details later,” said Kristine Akland, Northern Rockies director and senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The court saw right through the Forest Service’s vague plans and determined that moving targets aren’t good enough, especially when threatened animals and treasured public lands are at stake.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Yellowstone-National-Park-Grizzly-bears-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-12-12 14:57:36.270893

Tennessee state leaders announced on Friday morning that the state will partner with Turning Point USA, a conservative nonprofit founded by the late Charlie Kirk.
They announced at an event at the Tennessee State Capitol that there would be Club America chapters, student-led organizations affiliated with Turning Point USA, at every high school in the state of Tennessee.
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who is running for Tennessee governor, and Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, spoke at the event announcing the partnership. There was no media invited to the event but a 30-minute video was posted on Rumble, social media platform that’s particularly popular with right-wing creators.
Gov. Bill Lee appeared in a video that was played at the event.
“I am encouraged to see significant interest from Tennessee students in starting Club America chapters, an effort that will give students an opportunity to respectfully engage in the issues that shape our country,” Lee said.
Lee and Johnson did not discuss the terms of the partnership or where the money to fund it would come from or how much it might cost.
“I’m proud to be here on behalf of Gov. Lee to make this very, very special announcement,” Johnson said at the event. “Today, we are announcing that the state of Tennessee is forming a partnership with Turning Point USA, with a shared goal of establishing Turning Point chapters at every high school, every college, every university campus in our great state, in honor of Charlie Kirk.”
Riley Gaines, a former college swimmer and opponent of transgender athletes in women’s sports, first talked about the partnership between the state and the conservative nonprofit in November at an event at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, as reported by the Chattanooga Times Free Press.

A spokesperson from Lee’s office and Turning Point USA did not respond to questions about the partnership when asked in November.
Gaines, who also attended Friday’s event, said she hopes other red states like Tennessee will establish partnerships with Turning Point USA.
This week, Texas announced a similar partnership. Florida has one as well.
Turning Point USA endorsed Blackburn for governor on Dec. 5. The senator posted a video on Wednesday about the endorsement.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Turning-Point-Tennessee-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-12 14:57:36.270893

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A group of state attorneys general, including North Dakota’s, this week dropped a federal lawsuit that targeted health care for immigrants across the U.S.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach announced Wednesday he voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, but health care for certain immigrants was stripped away more than three months ago when President Donald Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule that offered health care plans to people who migrated to the U.S. as children.
The roughly 10,000 immigrants in the United States under Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals who purchased health insurance from the marketplace were removed from their plans by Oct. 1. An estimated 525,000 people are in the U.S. under DACA.
North Dakota joins Kansas-led suit challenging health insurance for DACA recipients

Kobach initially filed the lawsuit involving 18 other states after the Biden administration adopted rules in November 2024 enabling DACA participants to enroll in public health insurance plans, which wasn’t previously possible under the Affordable Care Act. Kobach argued in court against the policies, winning a preliminary injunction.
“This is a big win for the rule of law,” Kobach said in a Wednesday announcement. “Congress never intended that illegal aliens should receive Obamacare benefits.”
The lawsuit was filed in North Dakota federal district court.
North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor closed the case on Thursday after Kobach filed a notice of voluntary dismissal.
Traynor ruled roughly a year ago to suspend the Biden administration program while the lawsuit progressed.
There were approximately 130 DACA recipients in North Dakota as of June 30, 2024, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service.
The 19 states bringing the case were Kansas, North Dakota, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

Some medical systems seemed to be involved, too (Naomi O'Donnell/The Beacon).For years, stories circulated around Joplin, Missouri, about the city’s homeless population and how they arrived in the city.
Calls would come in to city officials following a recurring theme.
“People were coming to the City Council meetings and saying, ‘I don’t know why you guys don’t know this, but I’m witnessing busloads of people being dropped off in our town,’” said Joplin Mayor Keenan Cortez. “‘Buses are coming in, stopping at gas stations, unloading and the buses are turning around and going back.’”
The city commissioned a study to investigate. But it came back with no hard evidence.
Still, the reports kept coming in. So the city took a deeper look.
Officials collected video evidence of out-of-state law enforcement vehicles dropping people off at truck stops. Some medical systems seemed to be involved, too. They also gathered signed affidavits from people who were new to Joplin, saying they were given promises of a shelter bed or resources at the end of their ride.
“We were starting to hear from people in our community that, ‘I was brought to Joplin and just dropped off. I was in trouble over there. That community didn’t deal with me. They put me in a car, a van, a bus and said there’s help for you,’” Cortez said.
Instead, they were left without their support system, in a new city with limited resources and few places to turn.
Cortez said city officials aren’t sure how many people shared similar stories.
“At the end of the day, I don’t know if it was 15, if it was 50,” Cortez said. “As a mayor, it doesn’t matter.”
Joplin officials put their heads together with the city’s legal team. After sending cease-and-desist letters to the organizations they believed were dropping people off in the city, the City Council started considering legislation to ban the practice.
The City Council passed an ordinance at the beginning of November. It isn’t uncommon for medical systems to refer patients needing specialized treatment, or for victims of domestic violence, to be sent to a shelter in another town. The ordinance includes exemptions for those situations.
So far, Cortez and city officials think the letters and new ordinance appear to be working. They haven’t had any reports of people being dropped off since the ordinance was passed. But the trend points to a larger problem Missouri’s cities are facing as homelessness rises across the state.
 Missouri’s reliance on larger cities for services for the homeless population

It is fairly common for smaller, rural areas to rely on the services in larger cities for things like shelters, medical care or mental health treatment.
From 2023 to 2024, the number of unsheltered people grew 9% in Missouri, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development point-in-time counts. In Kansas, the number grew by 6%, while Oklahoma saw an 18% jump.
Columbia is similar to Joplin when it comes to being a regional hub for services and shelter beds.
Columbia began working more closely on reducing homelessness in 2023 by establishing a program within Boone County’s Department of Public Health to connect people with resources. City officials also created a homeless outreach team within the police department to try and divert people from the justice system.
Now, the city has launched the Ride Home program, which gives homeless or impoverished community members free rides back to their hometowns or to support systems up to three hours away. If someone needs to travel farther, the city will purchase a bus ticket to get them to where they need to go.
Since the launch in October, the city has provided three rides, said Austin Krohn, public information specialist at the Columbia & Boone County Department of Public Health and Human Services.
“People come in for mental health services, or if there is a facility that can only do a certain type of screening for them,” Krohn said. “People are coming here from all over Missouri to get services, and then they’re stuck here.”
Local service providers and shelters can refer people to the program to receive a free ride. People must have verifiable support at the destination, a referral, photo ID and no outstanding warrants in the county.
Studies have shown that voluntary transport to a support system can be instrumental in improving someone’s housing situation.
San Francisco runs a robust transportation program, similar to Ride Home in Columbia. In fiscal year 2024, the agency that runs the program gave 230 rides.
San Francisco officials followed up with riders 90 days after their ride, and found that of the 230 served, 61 found housing, while 29 had another or unknown location. The remaining riders were unreachable or declined to be surveyed as part of the program.
“When I was doing direct service 30 years ago, people called it Greyhound therapy,” said Jeff Olivet, the former executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. “Get a bus ticket to another town, just get out of here, basically. Sometimes that can be incredibly helpful if people are really wanting and needing to get back to family and social supports.”
But if someone is transported or coerced to leave town against their will, it can lead to poorer outcomes, Olivet said.
“Transportation can be critical,” Olivet said. “But if it’s basically, ‘Get out of town or we’re going to arrest you,’ that doesn’t solve homelessness for anybody. It just moves the problem around.”
One 2023 study modeled over 20 U.S. cities concluded that involuntary displacement of people experiencing homelessness — things like encampment sweeps or involuntary transport to another area — could lead to substantial increases in morbidity and mortality.
The study linked involuntary displacement with worse outcomes for overdoses and hospitalizations and a decrease in getting connected with treatment for opioid use. It said the displacements could contribute to deaths of homeless people who use drugs.
A 2017 investigation from The Guardian analyzed nearly 35,000 relocation journeys over a six-year period. The investigation found that most riders were relocated to places with a lower median income.
 How Missouri fares 

And as homelessness rates rise across all of Missouri, cities may need to start thinking about how to address these gaps, Olivet said.
“In the case of rural areas, or even suburban areas, where there aren’t as many shelter options for people, there aren’t as many mental health treatment programs, there aren’t as many supportive services. Oftentimes, the only way to get help is by going to a larger urban area,” Olivet said.
“That speaks to a tremendous gap when we don’t have good services, support and housing options for people in rural areas. They have to go somewhere else, even if they are from that rural area.”
In Missouri, the numbers aren’t improving.
The state’s continuum of care — a group of agencies that work under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to address homelessness — found in its most recent report that homelessness is rapidly increasing across the state.
In Region 9, which includes the southwest corner of the state (but does not include metro areas like Joplin or Springfield, which run their own continuums of care outside of the statewide framework), 2023 data found a 133% rise in unsheltered homelessness and a 100% rise in sheltered homelessness from 2022 to 2023.
The area also saw family homelessness increase by 100% from 2022 to 2023.
Region 10, which represents the counties surrounding the Kansas City area, 2023 point-in-time data showed a 3% increase in unsheltered homelessness and a 119% increase in sheltered homelessness from 2022. Family homelessness increased by 173%.
In the group’s annual report, every region saw at least one metric of homelessness, sheltered or unsheltered, increase from 2022 to 2023.
It rings alarm bells with Mary Kenion, the chief equity officer at the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
“At least half of all people experiencing homelessness in largely rural continuums of care do so outdoors, in unsheltered locations,” Kenion said. “We’re also seeing family homelessness on the rise, in rural communities specifically.”
And in their report, the Missouri continuum of care providers noted that while larger towns were better equipped to handle homelessness, it highlights the lack of resources in more rural areas.
The report found a positive relationship between the number of beds available in permanent housing situations and the length of time someone was homeless. For every 1% increase in permanent housing beds, there was a 54-day decrease in the length of time someone was homeless.
Although solutions like access to permanent housing show promise, roadblocks remain.
A coalition of nonprofits and local governments recently sued the Trump administration, arguing it created unreasonable restrictions on state continuums of care across the country. The lawsuit argues that the administration is looking to shift funding away from proven solutions that improve homelessness and that it could force up to 170,000 Americans into homelessness.
The new rules change what types of projects are eligible for funding through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the criteria for selecting projects and the conditions grantees have to accept to receive the funding, the lawsuit argues.
Ultimately, Joplin Mayor Cortez and other experts said that following up with someone after they receive care or resources is key in reducing homelessness.
Cortez is excited about a new development of 16 tiny homes dedicated to providing permanent housing situations for Joplin. But addressing the issue takes everyone coming together, he said.
“This is an ongoing thing that everybody in the community is involved in —– the health care community, the religious community,” Cortez said. “We have some passionate champions in our community working to resolve this problem.”

A Mass of Christian burial is being celebrated in the Chapel of Saint Michael the Archangel on the campus of Saint Michael’s College in Colchester on Friday, December 12, at 10:00 a.m.  Interment will be private at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Professor Edward Pfeifer Scholarship Fund, Saint Michael’s College, 1 Winooski Park, Box 256, Colchester, VT 05439; or to Home Health and Hospice, University of Vermont Health, 1110 Prim Road, Colchester, VT 05446.

Frank Landry, M.D., died peacefully on Saturday, Dec. 6, on home hospice, after suffering the effects of the acute illness Goodpasture Syndrome.  
Born in Newton, Massachusetts, to Frank and Nan Landry on Jan. 27, 1960, Frank grew up with his beloved siblings Joan, David, Nannette and Michael.  There he appreciated the beauty of the ocean and all it offered — swimming, fishing, exploring salt marshes and clamming.
With the death of his father at age 8, the family was left financially burdened but emotionally rich.  Their mother taught the family the tremendous importance of a work ethic, something Frank embraced his entire life.  With his two brothers in their own neighborhood landscaping company, Frank cared for the property of the summer Scituate residents. 
Frank was proud of his excellent public education in Scituate. Combining his hard-earned savings with scholarship funds, he attended and graduated from Saint Michael’s College in 1982, proud to pay his own way.  He met Justine Pfeifer there, the kindest, most loving woman on the planet.
Frank wanted to be a doctor and follow in his brother David’s footsteps, studying medicine. Though crushed by David’s suicide, he maintained a commitment to medicine as a career.  Frank graduated from Tufts University School of Medicine in 1987, receiving a Health Professions Scholarship through the U. S. Army.  Besides marrying Justine and adopting his children, Frank always said that the ten years serving for the country was the best thing he ever did.
He completed his training in Internal Medicine at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Uniformed Services University Medical School.  He served ten years in the Medical Corps at Walter Reed and at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington. His passion was not just doctoring, but also teaching and mentoring medical students and residents.  During his tenure in the service, he traveled the country and world, serving during Desert Storm, and receiving numerous awards for teaching and medical practice. 
Moving to Vermont in 1996 to be closer to family, Frank joined UVM Medical Center and UVM Medical School  as an associate professor of medicine.  He opened his own practice in Burlington’s New North End, recruiting and mentoring younger doctors, showing them the joy of an independent practice.  In 2011, Frank further defined his clinical practice by establishing the first MDVIP concierge internal medicine practice in Vermont.  He was always an advocate for the independent doctor. 
Over the years, Frank served as medical director of Birchwood Terrace Health Care, president of FAHC Medical Staff in 2004, governor of the American College of Physicians (Vermont Chapter) and president of Vermont Internal Medicine. 
His greatest enjoyment in life came from his family.  Frank was passionate about embracing life in Vermont with Justine and their two sons, Nick and Matt. Fishing, swimming, sledding, and exploring with his boys at the Pfeifer home on Molly’s Falls Pond in Cabot was the delight of his life. He was most proud of Nick and Matt, despite all the usual struggles of growing up, for how well they have done, and how well they chose their partners, Martha and Rachel.
Frank leaves his wife and friend of 40 years, Justine Pfeifer Landry, as well as his best friends — his sons and their spouses — Nick and Martha, Matt and Rachel. He is survived by his siblings and their spouses in Massachusetts:  Joan (Clinton), Nannette (Paul), and Michael (Janet), as well as his sister- and brothers-in-law, Elizabeth, John (Brenda), and Martin (David).  He was always grateful for the loyalty of his patients, treating them as part of his family.  
Frank and his family wish to express their gratitude for the exceptional care he received from the nurses on McClure 6 as well as the staff of the dialysis unit at UVMMC.

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Eighty days have passed since coastal regulators agreed to ramp up pressure against Quidnessett Country Club to remove a rock wall built without permission along its shoreline. 
It’s been far longer — 835 days — since the same North Kingstown Country Club was first caught and reprimanded for erecting the 600-foot-long stone wall in defiance of state coastal regulations.
Yet the wall still stands. And the no holds-barred enforcement order issued by the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council on Sept. 23 has not amounted to much in the eyes of Topher Hamblett, executive director for Save the Bay.
“It’s been crickets since they voted,” Hamblett said in an interview Thursday. “We did a search of all available public records to see if they have had any communication.”
Have they forgotten? Hamblett doesn’t know. But he can’t forget, worried about lasting damage to the shoreline and habitat, and restricted public access.
“The Council must end its delay game and require Quidnessett Country Club to immediately restore the shoreline to allow the public to regain access to its tidelands and repair the Bay habitat harmed by its blatant violation,” Hamblett wrote in a Dec. 10 email to Ray Coia, CRMC chairman.

The email recounts the main events involved in the complex dispute encompassing environmental, development and administrative issues — and now the subject of a trio of lawsuits by Quidnessett.
The club built the rock wall along its shoreline in the winter 2023, seeking to protect the 14th hole of its signature golf course against rising sea levels and shoreline erosion. But the permanent structure is expressly forbidden under state regulations restricting development in economically sensitive habitats.
 In January, the CRMC denied an initial request by the country club to seek retroactive permission for the wall. The council’s unanimous vote seemingly ended the debate over the state’s classification of nearby waters and shifted focus to details of how Quidnessett ought to remove the wall and restore the shoreline.
That proved no less challenging, with seven plans submitted by Quidnessett — the most recent sent Sept. 5 — all rejected by coastal staff because they did not meet state coastal requirements. 
Muddying the waters: three separate lawsuits by Quidnessett against the agency and its appointed council members, alleging procedural violations and challenging the validity of shoreline restoration requirements.
The most recent complaint, filed on Oct. 23 in Providence County Superior Court, applies the same arguments of the prior legal lawsuits to the council’s Sept. 23 enforcement order. It asks a judge to reverse the enforcement order, contending that the dispute should be referred to an administrative hearing officer under the agency’s own guidelines, while labeling coastal regulators’ conditions for the location and slope of a natural barrier to replace the rock wall as “arbitrary and capricious.” 
Robin Main, an attorney representing Quidnessett, declined to comment.
Laura Dwyer, a spokesperson for the state coastal regulatory agency, acknowledged requests for comment but did not provide a response. The agency has not filed written responses to any of the three lawsuits from Quidnessett, according to public court documents.
The legal challenges could be holding up enforcement action. But Hamblett still thinks there is a bigger problem with what he sees as a pattern of inconsistent treatment and favoritism for well-connected property owners. 
He referred back to council’s now-infamous 2020 vote allowing Champlin’s Marina on Block Island to expand. The decision, which reversed a prior block of the marina expansion, drew swift public scrutiny and allegations of back room deals.  In 2022, the Rhode Island Supreme Court struck down the council’s approval of the marina expansion, finding it failed to meet requirements around public input and transparency in its decision making. 
“The Rhode Island public cannot help but wonder on whose behalf the Council is working,” Hamblett wrote in the email to Coia. “Is it the people of Rhode Island, who expect their coastal agency to protect Narragansett Bay and abide by its own rules and regulations? Or is it well-connected actors who brazenly violate coastal protection laws, knowing that the Council will assist them?”










The Rhode Island public cannot help but wonder on whose behalf the Council is working.

Or is it well-connected actors who brazenly violate coastal protection laws, knowing that the Council will assist them?


– Topher Hamblett, executive director of Save the Bay


Gov. Dan McKee, Attorney General Peter Neronha, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson were copied on Hamblett’s email. 
Advocates have pressured state lawmakers for years to overhaul the coastal agency, abolishing the politically appointing council and redirecting decision-making power to its expert, administrative staff. Yet the legislation failed to advance in either chamber for the last three years amid cost concerns. 
In 2025, on the final day of the legislative session, the Rhode Island General Assembly agreed to a modest restructuring that adds professional qualifications and reduces the size of the council from 10 to seven people. 
“We’ll see how that goes,” Hamblett said of the restructuring. “We’re going to continue to push for real change. It’s important to keep this issue in front of state leaders, even though there appears to be indifference.”
Neronha, who has joined the chorus of critics calling to overhaul the coastal regulatory agency, said his office was considering “alternative enforcement options” for Quidnessett.
“When Quidnessett decided to build an illegal seawall on protected waters, they did so with blatant disregard for the law and under the assumption if they got caught there wouldn’t be consequences; not a bad bet given the reputation of the Council,” Neronha said in an emailed response Thursday. “And while the CRMC ultimately did the right thing, they have yet to take corrective enforcement action. Rhode Islanders rely on the coast, in part, to support their social and economic well-being, and unfortunately, the Council does not reliably act in the best interest of Rhode Islanders.”
McKee’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
Greg Pare, a spokesperson for Lawson, noted that the Quidnessett enforcement was tied up in litigation when asked for comment about the email.

The family is holding a small closed ceremony soon, but is planning a much grander send off in the coming summer — a place where we can all gather one last time in her name and celebrate the life and the force that she was. More details will be forthcoming.

Colleen Candace Dunn passed away on Friday evening, Nov. 28, after a difficult battle with lung cancer. She is survived by her three children — Erica, Heidi and Nathaniel — as well as her beautiful grandchildren — Adeline, Tobias, Silas and Asa — whom she loved deeply.
Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Nov. 14, 1953, to Melvin Dunn and Mildred Baird, she had a challenging childhood and was eventually adopted by her uncle, who sent her to a boarding school in Bordeaux at the age of 12. Here, she began a lifelong love of languages and cultures.
She was fluent in several languages and turned this passion into a career in ESL that spanned all the way to the Department of Education in Washington, DC. She worked tirelessly to bring language to children, and more recently worked in schools like Montpelier and U-32, teaching Latin and French. When she could no longer work full time, she collected a small group of neighborhood children in Brookfield and taught them Spanish in her home. Long story short, her children learned quickly to never challenge her to a game of Scrabble!
While we mourn her passing, we are left with all that her generous spirit has given. Her love of travel, recently visiting Greece with her sisters. Her love of music — she saw James Taylor this year and even caught Joni Mitchell’s last performance in the Gorge. Her love of books, of museums, of thrifting, of art and food, of gathering around a full table. All these gifts live on in her family.
She was a wild and wondrous woman who was able to make something out of nothing, spin fancy from invisible silk thread; a woman who would open the door and invite you in for dinner knowing full well she hadn’t much to share. She will be sorely missed by all whom she touched.

The rally is scheduled from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 16 on the state Capitol lawn.
With the respective chambers of the state Legislature in session next week before the holiday break, supporters and organizers are hoping their voices will be heard and that they can find common ground with lawmakers who could help in their fight against data centers.
Plans for various data centers have been cropping up in rural areas, and there has been an outpouring of opposition from a wide swath of residents from both sides of the political aisle.
The protest and rally scheduled for Dec. 16 is being billed as a bipartisan affair and a unity event to build up the burgeoning anti-AI data centers movement.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Rally organizers on social media have said their main demands are for no secret deals between utilities, developers, the AI companies that would benefit from the data centers and local or state governments. They are urging local and state government officials to slow the process and not fast-track approvals, and for the deals to take place in public without non-disclosure agreements, redacted planning documents or backroom negotiations with big tech companies.
Also among their demands is a statewide moratorium on data centers, which advocates hope lawmakers will be able to push along – one of several reasons they’re flocking to Lansing next week.  Organizers are calling for land and water protections as conversations around approving new data centers intensify, and for rural community support as some feel they are being bullied or taken to court in attempts to silence the opposition.
Speakers are scheduled for the event, but the social media invites give no indication if any state government officials are scheduled to speak. The invites do indicate, however, that rallygoers will hear speakers from both political parties, community leaders and residents.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-123421.png,,,2025-12-12 12:58:23.336911

But the chief judge vacated the decision and ordered a rehearing. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gun owners looking to topple a New Jersey law banning guns in parks, bars, beaches, and other “sensitive places” have successfully persuaded a federal appeals court to rehear the case.
A three-judge panel rejected their arguments in a September ruling and largely upheld the law Gov. Phil Murphy signed in December 2022.
But the gun owners in October asked that the full U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals reconsider the panel’s ruling, which they contend conflicts with a June 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared gun carry a constitutional right.
On Thursday, Chief Judge Michael A. Chagares vacated the September ruling and granted a rehearing after a majority of the 3rd Circuit’s active judges voted for a rehearing. Chagares was appointed to the appeals court by former President George W. Bush in 2006 and became the 3rd Circuit’s chief judge in 2021. The rehearing is scheduled for Feb. 11.
September’s ruling — based on arguments made in October 2023 — was not unanimous. U.S. Circuit Court Judge David J. Porter, an appointee of President Donald Trump, issued a fiery dissent accusing his colleagues of “selective reading and overreading of Supreme Court precedent, methodological mistakes, and anachronistic disdain for public carry (which) combine to generate constitutional error.”
A majority of the judges on the full 3rd Circuit were appointed by Republicans, and most of them by Trump.
The Firearms Policy Coalition, one of the case’s plaintiffs, celebrated Chagares’ order.
“This significant development ensures that the entire court will evaluate the state’s unconstitutional scheme under the proper historical and constitutional framework,” the coalition said in an unsigned statement. “The prior panel’s flawed decision — upholding key elements of the law — has been vacated, restoring the case to a posture where New Jersey’s unlawful policies can be fully and fairly scrutinized.”
Attorney General Matt Platkin said the panel that issued September’s ruling “carefully and exhaustively studied the history and recognized that our statute was constitutional.”
The state will continue to defend the law, Platkin said, saying it protects residents from gun violence.
“Laws like this one have improved law enforcement’s ability to keep our community safe, and they have helped contribute to the dramatic reductions in gun violence and record low numbers of shootings and other violent crimes we have seen in recent years,” Platkin said. “We look forward to continuing our defense of our critical sensitive-places law.”
The law makes it a third-degree crime, punishable by up to five years imprisonment, to take guns into 25 sensitive spaces. Those include casinos, zoos, youth sporting events, public libraries and museums, concert venues, theme parks, transit hubs, churches, hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities, and movie sets.
That leaves people legally allowed to carry guns on private property with property owners’ permission. They can also carry while hunting and fishing.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Forever War, Part 2: This story is published in partnership with WHQR, a nonprofit radio station and NPR affiliate in Wilmington. It is the second in a series of stories about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina.
The shipment arrived by FedEx, packed in dry ice. Inside were 119 plastic vials, each containing three drops of blood that had been stored at minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit for as long as a decade.
Jane Hoppin, an environmental epidemiologist at N.C. State University had ordered the blood. From 2010 to 2016, Wilmington residents had donated their serum to a biobank run by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to help scientists better understand how the body works. Now Hoppin wanted to learn if high concentrations of PFAS in the city’s drinking water were also present in the donors’ blood.

However, Hoppin and her fellow scientists didn’t anticipate finding one type of PFAS compound: TFA. The chemical industry has touted its toxicity as being “of lower concern,” because it breaks down quickly in the body.
Yet there it was, TFA, in five-year-old water and blood.
“We were surprised,” Hoppin said. “No one expected this.”
Hoppin was born in northern California and grew up in Cincinnati, about 200 miles west of a DuPont factory that discharged PFOA, a chemical used in non-stick cookware, into the Ohio River.
Even as a very young child she was interested in chemicals and their effects on human health.
When Hoppin was 4, her mother took her to a school psychologist to determine whether she could enter kindergarten a year early. The psychologist asked Hoppin to draw a person. When she finished, the psychologist seemed alarmed and recommended she stay home another year.
The people in her drawings had no nose or mouth.
“My mom said, ‘Why didn’t you draw a nose or a mouth?’” Hoppin recalled.
It was 1968, two years before Congress established the Clean Air Act, and Hoppin had recently seen television footage of smoggy Los Angeles.
She remembers telling her mom, ‘Well, I didn’t want them to breathe the air.’”
Now Hoppin feels the same way about people drinking water from the Cape Fear River.





Because many labs were closed during the pandemic, the Wilmington study took five years, but in October Hoppin and her colleagues at N.C. State and UNC released the results. All of the blood samples contained at least one of 34 toxic chemicals known as PFAS, including some used in fluorochemical manufacturing at Chemours, 80 miles upstream in Fayetteville.


More than three-quarters of the Wilmington blood samples contained elevated levels of TFA, whose health and environmental effects aren’t fully understood.
The study included archived samples of the Cape Fear River and Wilmington’s drinking water. They also contained elevated levels of more than two dozen PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, including TFA.
There are no federal or state drinking water standards for TFA.
Hoppin knew that It would not be unusual to find certain types of PFAS in the water and blood samples. In particular, PFOA and PFOS, known as “long-chains” because of their molecular structure, are notoriously persistent and linger in the environment for hundreds of years. In the human body, it can take more than a decade to eliminate them.
But TFA is an ultra-short chain compound. That the blood still contained such high levels of TFA suggested that the donors were being exposed to the compound, not just from Chemours, but by a variety of sources that scientists are only becoming aware of.
The troubling results opened a new front in a decades-long battle North Carolina environmentalists have been waging against PFAS in the state’s drinking water and air, soil and food.

PFAS Are Everywhere

There are tens of thousands of types of PFAS, which are found in many consumer products,as well as water-resistant clothing, furniture and personal care products. The compounds are ubiquitous, contaminating air, drinking water, fish, soil, crops, eggs and milk worldwide. PFAS even contribute to climate change by disrupting the ocean cycle and increasing the emissions of greenhouse gases.
PFAS exposure can lead to myriad serious health conditions, including kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disorders, reproductive problems, high cholesterol and a depressed immune system.




In 2024, they celebrated when the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden finally enacted the first drinking water standards for PFOA, PFOS, GenX and three other related compounds.
But their victory was short-lived. During President Donald Trump’s second term, the EPA has weakened or gutted its few PFAS regulations. The agency has delayed implementation of drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS by two years, until 2031.
In September it also petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to rescind drinking water standards for several compounds, including GenX, which Chemours uses to produce non-stick cookware, food packaging and firefighting foam.
The government shutdown earlier this fall delayed the court case. Lawyers for the agency and opponents of the rollback are scheduled to file additional legal briefs this month.
As the chemical industry applauds the rollbacks, Chemours is planning to expand its Fayetteville Works plant, the source of GenX and dozens of similar compounds, including TFA.
The company doesn’t make TFA in Fayetteville, but its presence in the river and the air illustrates a stubborn aspect of the ubiquitous compounds: PFAS precursors.
There are thousands of such precursors, substances that, under certain conditions, transform and break down into a different PFAS compound. Like wood is a precursor to ash, and iron to rust, the compound PAF degrades and becomes TFA.
Chemours told state regulators in February that “based on risk assessment modelling and available toxicological data for similar compounds, TFA is not believed to be harmful to human health or the environment.”
The N.C. State study and other research calls into question Chemours’ assertions that TFA is benign. The compound is widespread in the environment, and even though it breaks down relatively quickly in the body, people rapidly absorb it from their food, drinking water and air.
Hoppin and Duke University scientists found in a separate study released earlier this year that the compound was present in house dust.
When TFA and other ultra-shortchain compounds accumulate in the body, according to the N.C. State study, they “can reach very high levels,” potentially harming human health.
Earlier this year the German government proposed classifying TFA as toxic to reproduction, including impaired fertility and harm to the fetus.
“We’re piecing together the past,” Hoppin said. “But the real concern is that we continue to measure exposure in people today.”
High Levels of TFA
N.C. State scientist Detlef Knappe was failing at taking his sabbatical. This fall, between globetrotting trips to Australia, Singapore and beyond, he was proofreading and finalizing the Wilmington blood and drinking water study.
Knappe had played an outsized role in the protests that led to the EPA’s drinking water standards for several types of PFAS. He was among the scientists who, in 2015, discovered GenX in the Cape Fear River and Wilmington’s drinking water. Those findings launched an environmental movement, with thousands of North Carolinians urging the EPA to regulate GenX and other PFAS in drinking water.

As part of that research, Knappe had stored samples of river water and drinking water in case he wanted to reanalyze them in the future.
In 2024, that time came.
The collection date of the water and blood samples was critical. To fully understand the extent of residents’ PFAS exposure, Hoppin and Knappe needed samples taken before June 2017, when state regulators forced Chemours to stop discharging the compounds into the river.
Knappe retrieved samples from one day in late May 2017, when he and his colleagues had collected water from 10 spots in the river: upstream and downstream of Chemours, in Wilmington and at the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, which provides drinking water for nearly 200,000 people.


The study found that concentrations of TFA in the Cape Fear River immediately downstream of Chemours reached 6 million parts per trillion, “orders of magnitude” higher than in upstream samples. This suggested Chemours was a significant source of the compound at these locations.
By the time the TFA reached Wilmington and passed through the utility’s water treatment plant, the levels were still extremely high: 108,000 parts per trillion.
That’s equal to 50 times the health guidance level of 2,200 ppt set by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. It is also above the German Federal Health Agency’s advisory of 60,000 ppt; Germany considers TFA to be toxic to reproduction.
“The overwhelming evidence is that these compounds are of concern,” Knappe said. “I’m very concerned that we’re not going to get TFA under control in the time that is needed to prevent adverse health outcomes.”
A “Regrettable Substitute”
TFA is what scientists refer to as a “regrettable substitute,” because in trying to solve one environmental problem, it creates another.
In 1985, the problem was an enormous hole that researchers had discovered in the Earth’s ozone layer, which shields the planet from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. The culprits were chlorofluorocarbons, also known as CFCs, used in refrigerants in common appliances, such as air conditioners.
Not only were CFCs exfoliating the Earth’s protective skin, they were also contributing to climate change. Two years later, companies began phasing out CFCs under an international treaty, the Montreal Protocol, and replaced them with other substances that in the atmosphere can transform into TFA.
Since then, TFA has become baked into modern life. When Prozac, the antidepressant taken by 5.7 million people in the U.S., breaks down in water, it forms TFA.
At data centers, the AI that drafts emails, mines cryptocurrency  and analyzes medical scans requires enormous computing power. To prevent the computers from overheating, data centers use cooling fluids, some of which emit chemicals that become TFA. Chemours makes such a product at its plant in Corpus Christi, Texas.
Dozens of pesticides also contain TFA, including one recently approved by the EPA to kill insects on corn, soybeans, wheat and citrus. The pesticide, called isocycloseram, is also approved for home lawns and to kill cockroaches, termites and bedbugs.
The planet is so bombarded with TFA that, since 2010, global levels have increased as much as 17 times compared with previous decades, according to Scandinavian scientists. They warned that TFA could cause “potential irreversible, disruptive impacts on vital earth system processes.”
“We went from compounds that destroyed the ozone layer,” Knappe said, “to compounds that break down and pollute the earth with TFA.”
What’s Coming Out of Chemours Now?

One day in late September, Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette paddled his aluminum rowboat toward the Chemours Fayetteville Works plant. The N.C. State scientists were finalizing their study, but their findings would show only a snapshot of Chemours’ past discharges. Burdette wanted to know how much TFA and other ultra-short chain compounds Chemours was currently sending into the river.
He dipped a sampler into the water near Outfall 2, where the company discharges treated wastewater unrelated to its manufacturing. He continued downstream to the boat ramp below the Huske Dam. There, he collected water entering the Cape Fear via a seep, then rowed to Outfall 3, to grab more water leaving the southern edge of the plant.
Burdette returned to Wilmington, where he collected drinking water from a tap, and then a second one in nearby Brunswick County.
The results were disturbing: Water leaving Outfall 2 had concentrations of 14,950 ppt of TFA; discharge from Outfall 3 contained 21,900 ppt.
Near the dam, TFA concentrations reached 148,513 ppt. There were high levels of other ultra-short chain compounds, as well.
Downstream, TFA was penetrating the $80 million advanced filtration system the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority had installed to remove GenX. The drinking water Burdette collected at a Wilmington tap contained TFA at concentrations of 1,900 ppt; levels at the Brunswick County tap were 1,400.
Both results are below the Dutch health guidance level of 2,200 ppt in drinking water.
“It is unfortunate, though unsurprising, that we continue to see the impacts from Chemours’ decades of PFAS releases from their chemical manufacturing plant on the Cape Fear River,” said utility spokesman Vaughn Hagerty. “Chemours continues to shift the ever-growing, multimillion-dollar burden for addressing its PFAS contamination to downstream water users.”
Burdette’s findings bolstered concerns raised by Southern Environmental Law Center about the plant’s TFA discharges, especially in light of the planned expansion.
SELC is urging the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality to require Chemours, as part of its pending wastewater discharge permit, to sample for TFA and other ultra-short chains in Outfall 3. DEQ should then limit the amount of TFA that enters the river, SELC wrote.
Legally, if the DEQ doesn’t implement limits for TFA and other ultra-short chains, then Chemours could try to argue that those pollutants are permitted, SELC attorney Jean Zhuang told Inside Climate News. “That risks shielding them from liability for releasing them. It is really important that the state acts on these pollutants.”
The recent findings also raise questions about whether TFA is in private drinking water wells. A 2019 consent order among Chemours, Cape Fear River Watch and DEQ requires the company to test wells near the site for more than a dozen types of PFAS. However, TFA is not on the list.
“We don’t know if it’s in wells,” Hoppin said. “They need to be re-analyzed the samples for TFA.”
The program is voluntary. So far, 22,000 private wells have been sampled, and of those nearly 7,500 households have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.
A DEQ spokesperson said that the agency is weighing options to add TFA to its environmental monitoring. That would require a separate laboratory method outside those established by the EPA.
Since there is no regulatory drinking water standard for TFA, the spokesperson said, DEQ “does not have an alternative water recommendation to offer at this time.“
Chemours’ Expansion
The Chemours plant fans out over 2,100 acres flanked by N.C. Highway 87 and the Cape Fear River in northern Bladen County, about 15 miles from Fayetteville. A dozen straight roads and a railroad spur run through the property and impose order on the cacophony of tanks and pipes and smokestacks.
Those smokestacks emitted 267 pounds of TFA in 2021, according to documents accompanying the company’s air permit application. Once released, TFA floats through the air, falls to the ground and contaminates all that it touches.
A Chemours spokesperson told Inside Climate News even though the company would increase production of PFAS after the expansion, fluorinated organic compound emissions, which include TFA, to the air are still “projected to decrease by an average of 9 percent compared to the 2021 baseline.”
In its 2024 permit application, Chemours says indoor, outdoor and process emissions—those released directly from manufacturing and waste management—would decrease by 1,765 pounds per year.
But Zhuang of SELC said that claim is misleading. Accounting for maximum potential PFAS emissions from different product lines, the 2024 permit application shows a potential increase of 20 percent, or 2,500 pounds per year.
However, Chemours’ 2025 application shows significant decreases in PFAS air emissions, although those don’t account for the maximum possible.
The company has based some of its air emissions estimates on the demand for Chemours products. State records show DEQ, in reviewing the air permit application, recently asked Chemours for additional information over concerns about the use of “market conditions” as a basis for calculating potential emissions, as well as other inconsistencies.
“That’s not a reliable estimate of their actual potential emissions,” Zhuang said.
The Chemours spokesperson said that due to the “operational limitations of Vinyl Ether manufacturing units, the emissions potential hinges on how much of each product the company manufactures, which can vary.”
Chemours has also set a goal of reducing PFAS emissions and discharges by 99 percent globally by 2030, according to the company’s sustainability report released last year. Since 2018, Chemours says it has cut global PFAS emissions and discharges by three-quarters.
Ralph Mead, a professor of Earth and Ocean Sciences at UNC Wilmington, is an affable man who dresses casually, like a lot of people who live in beach towns. He specializes in understanding how contaminants travel through the air and where they land, a phenomenon known as atmospheric deposition.

On a humid and breezy September day, outside Mead’s lab between a parking lot and a marsh, he and a graduate student, Justin Parker, peered into a white bucket to see if it had collected rain overnight.
Similar to other PFAS compounds, when TFA is emitted into the air—from a refrigerator, a heat pump, a smokestack—it can travel hundreds of miles in different directions before it falls to the ground—or into a bucket.
If it had rained, Parker would inject the water through a labyrinth of instrumentation to analyze it for dozens of types of PFAS. The bucket was empty. But previous rainwater sampling had found very high levels of TFA, its origins likely varied, but unknown.
In Mead’s view, that’s the issue with Chemours’ air permit application: It doesn’t fully account for the long-range dispersion of the compounds, including TFA.


DEQ required Chemours as part of its application to show that increased PFAS production at Fayetteville Works would not increase the atmospheric deposition of the compounds coming from the facility.
State regulators wanted to avoid a repeat of what had happened with GenX: For more than a decade, Chemours emitted tons of the contaminant from its smokestacks. It fell to the ground and contaminated the soil, river and drinking water wells at least 28 miles away.
Chemours hired a contractor to study how PFAS would behave in the air. The analysis separated the compounds into “depositable”—meaning they can chemically transform and land nearby—and “non-depositable”—which would linger in the atmosphere for years and float far away.
The contractor’s report concluded that depositable emissions, including TFA, would total 1,700 pounds, an 11 percent reduction from 2021 estimates.
Non-depositable emissions would decrease by 15 percent, to 9,300 pounds.
Mead read the contractor’s study and said he still has questions about the fate of the non-depositable compounds. “We need to account for those,” he said. “It’s important for human exposure aspects, as well as contamination of the surface of the Earth away from the facility.”
Mead and scientists from four other public universities in North Carolina will soon launch a three-year study on the behavior of PFAS in air leaving the Chemours plant. The research, paid for by the N.C. Collaboratory, which funds academic research in the state, will include analysis of how the compounds transform in the atmosphere and their deposition patterns when they fall to  the Earth’s surface.
“This information may allow for better enforcement and regulation of these compounds from the facility,” Mead said.
Environmental advocates say the air permit application is yet another example of the company’s lack of transparency about its operations, transgressions documented in state and federal records.
In 2023, with EPA approval, the company imported GenX from its plant in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, but never informed state regulators. 
Three years earlier, DEQ cited the company for dumping soil and tree roots likely contaminated with PFAS into an unlined landfill. In 2017, Chemours failed to report a chemical spill at the plant.
And ??in the early 2000s, state records show when Chemours’ parent company, DuPont, told DEQ it was manufacturing GenX, it didn’t disclose that it was discharging the compound into the river.
Since Chemours has failed to clean up its existing and widespread contamination from Fayetteville Works, Zhuang told Inside Climate News, the facility “is absolutely not a place where the company should even be contemplating expanding its manufacturing operations.”
More recently, Chemours has kept under seal thousands of pages of information about the compounds, including health effects, as part of a federal lawsuit filed against the company by the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, Brunswick County and the Town of Wrightsville Beach.
Lawyers with SELC filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District in North Carolina, to intervene in the case, arguing the public has a First Amendment right to the information.
“After contaminating the drinking water, air, soil, and food for more than half-a-million North Carolinians for decades,” SELC’S motion reads, “the companies have no right to conceal essential documents related to their own pollution, including information on sampling data, air and wastewater treatment options, toxicology, and the public’s exposure to their toxic chemicals.”
The Southern Coalition for Social Justice filed a similar motion as well.
The company previously argued in court documents that the sealed material contains confidential, proprietary information. On Dec. 3, U.S. District Court Judge James Dever, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, ruled against Chemours. Dever wrote that the company’s “move to seal a broad class of documents they deem commercially sensitive or confidential do not provide specific evidence to support their motion.”
Warnings in an Empty Room
On the evening of Nov. 5, nearly every metal chair was empty at the Wilmington City Council meeting. Burdette, dressed in a slate gray button-up shirt and olive pants, his eyeglasses perched on his head, urged the council to pass a resolution opposing Chemours’ expansion.
Burdette noted that his two children drank the water for years before they knew it was contaminated, and that his father died of kidney cancer, which is linked to PFAS exposure, especially GenX.
“This resolution is our City Council saying it won’t tolerate the continued contamination of our air and water,” Burdette told the six-member council and mayor. “It tells DEQ that our leadership expects the state to do its job and protect the people and the environment. The expansion is a slap in the face to Wilmingtonians.”
The City Council unanimously passed the resolution. The next  week, on Nov. 12, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority board did the same, followed by the New Hanover County and Brunswick County Commissioners.
A Chemours spokesperson said the company “respects Wilmington City Council’s and Cape Fear Public Utility Authority’s right to express their opinions, though it seems counterintuitive to oppose a permit application that would ultimately reduce Fayetteville Works’ site-wide PFAS air emissions even further beyond the significant reductions already achieved in recent years, despite an increase in production.”
The company’s significant reductions in air emissions were required by DEQ as part of the consent order.
As Hoppin reflected on the study results, she sounded dismayed. PFAS contamination in the Cape Fear River Basin appears to be worse than scientists had surmised in 2017, when the public became aware of GenX in the drinking water. “It’s unfortunate that eight years later we’re getting a broad picture of what’s been happening.”
Chemours has not announced a timeline for its expansion. DEQ is reviewing the company’s permit applications, and after the agency releases the draft permits, it will hold public hearings and a public comment period.
Two weeks after the study was published, on Nov. 6, Chemours announced its latest financial results to investors and the public. The company’s net sales of $1.5 billion were flat compared with the third quarter of the previous year. But one product showed an 80 percent year-over-year growth: Opteon, a refrigerant  used at data centers. It emits TFA.
Upcoming in Forever War: Residents of the Lower Cape Fear River Basin are opposing a plan by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to deepen and widen parts of the Lower Cape Fear River at the Wilmington Port. The $1 billion project would stir up PFAS in sediment in the shipping channel—sediment that the Corps would need to dispose of—potentially harming the health of people and wildlife. PFAS and GenX are found in the Robeson County landfill, which accepts waste from Chemours.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blood-testing-scaled-1-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 11:57:20.107625

(Photo provided by Mullins McLeod)A Democrat running for governor slammed his fellow Democrats as corrupt this week as he asked a court to dismiss the misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge that resulted in calls for him to withdraw four months ago.
Mullins McLeod, a prominent Charleston attorney, has been at odds with his party leaders since days after he launched his campaign this summer, after police released footage of him ranting for more than 30 minutes in the back of a cruiser.
Tripling down on his refusal to exit the race, McLeod said the state Democratic Party chairwoman’s call for him to “focus on his mental and emotional well-being” is an example of the corruption he is running against.
“The idea that the chair of a political party would attempt to put his or her thumb on the scale is a perfect sign of political corruption,” he told the SC Daily Gazette on Thursday.
“When political parties try to put their thumb on the scale, guess what it does? It disenfranchises voters. It’s not good for democracy,” he said.
SC Democrats call on Charleston lawyer to suspend campaign for governor following arrest video

Christale Spain, who chairs the South Carolina Democratic Party, did not respond to the Gazette’s phone and email requests this week for comment.
McLeod said corruption was rampant in Columbia, accusing politicians of putting corporate profits over people.
When asked about his fellow Democrat in the race, Rep. Jermaine Johnson, McLeod suggested he, too, was corrupt.
“I think they should look at his voting record, and I think they should make a decision whether or not he is trying to clean up this corrupt system, or whether he’s part of it,” he said, without pointing to any specific vote or legislation.
Johnson, first elected to the state House in 2020, declined to address the accusations directly.
“Mr. McLeod is lashing out because he and his character have been on trial for his actions,” he said in a statement to the Gazette. “Unfortunately, this is not the first time Mr. McLeod has insulted me.
“Taking baseless shots at my character will not help restore his reputation,” said Johnson, of rural Hopkins in Richland County. “I hope he gets the help he needs.”
At a bond hearing following his arrest in May, McLeod’s attorney at the time explained his client’s behavior as stemming from a mental health episode and exhaustion, rather than drugs as officers suggested, The Post and Courier reported.
In a Tuesday court filing, a different attorney, Scott Bischoff, disputed the Charleston Police report altogether, saying McLeod was not “yelling at the top of his lungs” or in his underwear before he was arrested and began ranting to officers.
McLeod told the Gazette that his May arrest was unlawful but declined to go into more detail.
“My obligation is the voters of South Carolina, and I promise them that long before they go to the polls, they will know my side of the story,” he told the Gazette.
According to his lawyer’s filing, McLeod was rehearsing a political speech on an empty street near his house at the tip of Charleston’s peninsula when officers approached him and was wearing shorts with pockets, not underwear. Citing body cam footage, Bischoff said the officers did not witness any disorderly conduct before they arrested McLeod.
“There is no evidence he rambled incoherently or was loud and boisterous at that time and therefore there was no lawful reason for the officers to stop him much less place him in handcuffs,” according to the filing.
The filing said the officers failed to tell McLeod why he was being arrested before they handcuffed him, as the law requires.
“We have asked the city to conduct an internal affairs investigation regarding the officers that were involved in this case on account of over a dozen violations,” Bischoff said at a press conference Tuesday.
A judge will now rule on the motion to dismiss the charge.
In August, the Charleston Police Department released a nearly 35-minute video of McLeod from the night he was arrested that showed him shirtless and yelling in the back of a police car. During the profanity-laced rant on a variety of grievances, McLeod threatened to kick in the teeth of political opponents, said the U.S. president was likely his cousin, and called himself “one of the most just humans to ever walk this soil.” At one point, he repeated a racial slur used against Black people.
The department released the video to media outlets, including the Gazette, in response to open records requests. It did not respond to Thursday phone and email requests for comment.
After the video’s release, Spain discouraged McLeod from continuing his campaign in a statement posted on social media.
“Mullins McLeod is a skilled attorney, a former county Democratic Party chair who worked tirelessly for our values, and a member of a proud Lowcountry family with a long tradition of public service,” she wrote. “After reviewing the transcript of the dash cam footage from his recent arrest, it is clear that Mr. McLeod is navigating profound challenges and should focus on his mental and emotional well-being instead of a campaign for governor.”
McLeod is well-known for his legal work and was one of the lawyers who helped negotiate an $88 million settlement for the survivors and families of the nine victims killed by an avowed racist in 2015 at Charleston’s oldest Black church.
He also ran for governor in 2010 but suspended his campaign about four months before the Democratic primary.
McLeod, the first Democrat to announce a 2026 run for the Governor’s Mansion, is largely self-financing his campaign so far. Of the $1.4 million he’d raised as of Sept. 30, 94% was his own money, according to his latest campaign filing.
Johnson only has an initial filing showing $2,800 raised on Oct. 28, when he launched his campaign.
No Democrat has won a statewide race in South Carolina since 2006. It’s been 27 years since voters elected a Democrat as governor.
The five announced Republicans vying for the Governor’s Mansion are Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, and Attorney General Alan Wilson.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-12 16:34:09+00:00,CT Mirror,Efforts to require Asian American history in K-12 schools begin to pay off,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/12/efforts-to-require-asian-american-history-in-k-12-schools-begin-to-pay-off/,"Three years after CT became the third state to require Asian American and Pacific Islander history in K-12 education, a curriculum is launched.","When high school students in the West Hartford Public Schools district study World War II in the coming year, they will learn about more than just the typical hallmarks like Japanese American detention camps. They will also hear about Sadao Munemori, a soldier who died protecting comrades from a grenade. The 22-year-old posthumously became the first Japanese American awarded the Medal of Honor.
Lessons like this that delve beyond places have left teachers “humbled,” said Jessica Blitzer, the district’s social studies department supervisor who helped design curriculum for secondary grade levels.
“It’s one of those moments where you think ‘How have we not been doing that?’ These are moments where you realize this is really important, particularly given the population that we have in West Hartford, which is incredibly diverse in many ways,” Blitzer said.
Three years after Connecticut became the third state to require Asian American and Pacific Islander history in K-12 education, a developed curriculum is being put into motion. For now, instruction is being rolled out in every grade except fourth and fifth. Most of the district’s 9,300 students will have lessons integrated year-round. It will not be “the heritage month approach,” Blitzer said.
Since pandemic-fueled anti-Asian hate surged in 2020, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander advocates have mobilized to make AAPI history mandatory learning through legislation or state education boards. Today, most AAPI adults want educators to teach history through the lens of racism, slavery and segregation, according to a 2024 survey. There have been some successes, with around a dozen states passing statutes requiring curriculum.
Beyond well-known events, classes are diving into topics like stereotypes of South Asians and Vietnamese refugees. But as efforts arise, so has disagreement among Asian Americans.
More progressive voices question the fairness and optics of seeking approval from lawmakers who have rejected history focused on other historically marginalized groups, such as expanded Black history curriculum that some critics more recently maligned as woke ideology or likened to critical race theory.
How teaching AAPI history finally came to the forefront
AAPI organizations devastated by reports of thousands of verbal and physical attacks, including the 2021 Atlanta spa shootings that left six Asian women dead, ramped up lobbying for more inclusive education. The hope was teaching about AAPI contributions would foster understanding. In July 2021, Illinois became the first state to mandate Asian American history. In 2022, New Jersey and Connecticut followed.
An expanded look at history includes reading accounts of new immigrants in San Francisco and Wong Kim Ark’s Supreme Court fight for birthright citizenship. It also includes studying living figures like Chinese American architect Maya Lin.
Jason Oliver Chang, director of the University of Connecticut Asian and Asian American Studies Institute, helped develop legislation and train teachers. He remembers how lawmakers were moved by student testimonials.
“They were talking about their experiences sort of living two lives — one at school, one at home — feeling invisible and not feeling seen by their peers or respected by their peers,” Chang said. “Any time there’s a mention of someone that looks like them in a school curriculum, it’s that they’re the bad guys.”
President Donald Trump has intensified scrutiny of how schools address race, threatening to withhold federal funds over diversity initiatives. The guidance has left some educators uncertain, despite some anti-DEI measures being blocked or put on hold by federal judges. Concerned teachers should stick to the framework and consult with colleagues, advises Kate Dias, president of the Connecticut’s largest teachers’ union.
“Almost every person who teaches content of this nature does not do it in a way to say, ‘Here’s all the injustices of the world,’ ” Dias said. “The the call to action is ‘You need to now look at this information and you need to decide what it means.’ ”

Working with critics of race-conscious curriculum
Requiring AAPI history in schools has garnered bipartisan support. But in some conservative states, divisions have arisen over lawmakers who don’t see systemic racism and social justice as essential to history.
When Florida adopted AAPI history legislation in 2023, critics saw it as hypocritical given the state denied Advanced Placement African American studies for being “critical race theory.”
In Arizona, failed legislation mandating AAPI and Native Hawaiian history lessons was endorsed by the Japanese American Citizens League. The Arizona chapter came out against it.
Chapter leaders asserted the bill’s co-sponsor, state Republican Sen. John Kavanagh, and other supporters were only interested in rubber-stamping a sanitized history and ignoring African American and LGBTQ+ history.
Kavanagh equates talk of systemic racism with indoctrination. He previously supported barring college groups based on racial or ethnic identity and high school ethnic studies classes that seemed politicized.
He says teaching the history must be done in a “neutral, thorough manner.”
“I certainly have no problem teaching the history of Blacks or Hispanics or anybody,” Kavanagh said. “I don’t think there should be a course in a high school teaching students that this country is systemically racist when it’s not.”
The Arizona chapter of Make Us Visible, a national organization trying to establish AAPI history in every state, has faced criticism for not calling out right-leaning legislators. Astria Wong, chapter director, dismissed it.
“It’s really a good thing that even a conservative senator will support it. That means there is some bones in it,” Wong said. “It should be bipartisan anyway.”
Amber Reed, co-executive director of AAPI New Jersey, finds it upsetting.
“What teacher wants to suddenly start teaching Asian American history while sort of being discouraged from teaching African American history or Latinx history, the history of all of our communities,” Reed said.
A ‘deeper, richer’ look at American history
Before next summer, West Hartford Public Schools will assess how to improve curricula.
The goal is not to teach just “doom and gloom” to the student body — of which white children make up about 55%, Hispanics 21% and Asians and Black students more than 10% each — but a balanced look at history, said assistant superintendent Anne McKernan.
“There’s resistance, there’s perseverance, there’s greatness,” McKernan said. “As I look through the changes in elementary and the changes in secondary, it’s a richer look.”
Elementary grades are using books to learn culture, reading comprehension and vocabulary, said Erika Hanusch, district literacy and social studies curriculum specialist. For example, kindergartners are reading the picture book “Dumpling Soup” by Jama Kim Rattigan. Centered around a family in Hawaii, the characters come from different Asian backgrounds.
“It’s really more so embedded through story and lens,” Hanusch said. “And it’s giving teachers and students that natural opportunity to learn a little bit more about the where and the who and the traditions that come from those stories.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25336731932612-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 11:57:20.107625

President Donald Trump’s administration said in April it was “ending” the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which helped communities with predisaster projects to harden infrastructure and improve resilience against the increasing threats of climate change.
The administration called the program “wasteful and ineffective” and said it would halt $3.6 billion in funding awarded but not yet paid and would not award $882 million in grants for the following fiscal year.
The program’s disruption upended projects across hundreds of communities in both Republican- and Democratic-led states, thwarting plans to improve stormwater drainage, harden electrical lines and even help relocate households living in areas most vulnerable to disasters.
[RELATED: CT sues the Trump administration again, this time over FEMA funding]
In a statement Thursday, Connecticut Attorney General said, “Donald Trump tried to unilaterally dismantle and defund our government’s ability to prevent and prepare for natural disasters. We sued, and once again, we won.” Tong added, “Refusing to prepare for a disaster does not stop nature, does not save lives, and does not save money.”
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told The Associated Press Thursday that DHS “has not terminated BRIC,” but did not elaborate on the program’s status.
“The Biden Administration abandoned true mitigation and used BRIC as a green new deal slush fund,” the spokesperson said, referring to a Democratic plan to combat climate change. “It’s unfortunate that an activist judge either didn’t understand that or didn’t care.”
The order comes at a time of profound uncertainty over FEMA’s future and on the same day that a long-awaited meeting of the FEMA Review Council to present a report recommending reforms to the agency was abruptly canceled by the White House because it had not been fully briefed on the latest version of the report, according to a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Congress funded BRIC during the first Trump administration through the 2018 Disaster Recovery Reform Act, and FEMA launched the program in 2020. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made an additional $1 billion available for BRIC over five years, though only about $133 million had been delivered to communities by April, according to FEMA.
The program was criticized by some for being difficult to access for rural and less wealthy communities due to a complicated application process and cost-sharing requirements. But even Republican lawmakers like Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana opposed the cancellations and called for BRIC’s reinstatement.
“It protects families and saves taxpayer dollars in the long-run,” Cassidy said on the Senate floor a week after the funding cancellation. “That’s efficient in my book.”
Judge Richard G. Stearns found that FEMA’s actions were unlawful since Congress appropriated the money specifically for the grants and that there was an “inherent public interest in ensuring that the government follows the law.”
“The BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives,” Stearns wrote in the court order.
The Trump administration has slashed disaster preparedness dollars across multiple FEMA programs this year as part of its campaign to transfer more responsibility for disasters to states.
Since February, Trump has not approved any requests for hazard mitigation funding, a typical add-on that helps states, tribes and territories complete resilience projects after major disasters.
Emergency preparedness grants that states and local governments rely on to staff emergency management agencies and buy equipment are currently frozen after 12 states sued the Trump administration over unprecedented grant stipulations related to the administration’s immigration agenda.
Multiple studies have shown that preemptive investments in disaster readiness can yield significant savings. A 2024 study funded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found every $1 invested in disaster preparation saved $13 in economic impact, damage and cleanup costs.

They include Republican Sen. Andy Zay of Huntington, Democratic former Sen. Bob Deig of Evansville and Anthony Swinger, who works for the agency representing ratepayers.
The new commissioners, who begin work Jan. 12, will help guide state energy policy at a time of mounting public concern over rising electricity and natural gas bills.
“Hoosiers deserve reliable and affordable utilities and have been burdened by excessive and unnecessary utility rate increases for too long,” Braun said in a news release.

“I am appointing these three Hoosier leaders to serve on the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to ensure that Indiana has exceptional utilities without saddling families and businesses with excessive prices,” he said.
The men, according to the news release, “are aligned with Governor Braun’s commitment to making energy affordable for families and businesses.”
Zay will chair the IURC, the news release said. He has served in the Indiana Senate since 2016, with several years on the chamber’s dedicated utilities committee.
His appointment will create a vacancy in the Senate because the Indiana Constitution bans government employees from concurrently holding more than one “lucrative,” or paid, office.
Once Zay moves to the IURC job, a caucus of precinct committeemen from his district will have 30 days to meet and select a successor, according to Indiana Code. That person will serve out the rest of his four-year term, which is set to end November 2028.
Zay will be joined by Deig, a Democrat who spent a term in the Senate from 2006 to 2010, with time on the chamber’s utilities committee. The IURC’s makeup must include both political parties.
Swinger, meanwhile, has spent more than 25 years with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the state agency that represents ratepayers in cases before the commission. He is the executive director of technical operations, but previously managed media, consumer, and governmental relations.
The IURC is charged with ensuring that utilities provide safe, reliable service at just and reasonable rates. By law, the commission serves as an impartial arbiter — “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities” — but its decisions often draw scrutiny from consumer advocates and lawmakers alike.
The three men will fill roles left vacant by Commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett, who left in October, months before their terms were set to end. Chair Jim Huston’s term lapsed in April, but he pledged to stay on until a successor was chosen.
The jobs come with salaries of $152,000.

(Photo vis FAU)Florida’s Board of Governors on Friday scrapped a year-old rule that let its chair sign off on presidential finalists before they are sent for votes by university trustees — a policy critics said vested too much power in one individual.
Now, the state chair no longer will have a role in approving presidential finalists. Incoming BOG Chair Alan Levine, who starts his new position on Jan. 1, lauded the move as a win for non-consolidated power in the university sphere.
“I don’t think any chair of a board should have the power to act unilaterally to make decisions about the hiring of a president or anybody,” Levine said in Friday’s Board of Governors meeting. “I strongly support this particular change.”
Sitting Chair Brian Lamb agreed.
“Vice Chair Levine, I concur, and it’s all for the right reasons at the right time. I’m glad we’re making the change,” he said.
Last legislative session, the Florida House took a long look at, and passed, legislation that would have made the university presidential search process more public. The Senate began conversations, but ultimately did not pass similar legislation after Gov. Ron DeSantis said he would veto any such bill.
DeSantis has won nationwide acclaim from the right and condemnation from the left for his sweeping revamps to higher education. They include overhauling the former liberal arts school New College into a “Hillsdale of the South,” post-tenure review for professors, and installing political allies and former GOP lawmakers at colleges and universities statewide:

Former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez at Florida International University.
Former House GOP Leader Adam Hasner at Florida Atlantic University.

Former lobbyist and DeSantis appointee Marva Johnson at Florida A&M University.

Moez Limayem was approved, too, to be the University of South Florida president, after being named a sole finalist.
The BOG also approved an amendment to its policies, permitting contract extensions longer than one year for university presidents. Existing policy only permits one-year extensions.

WILMINGTON, Del. — The Ladybug Music Festival, widely recognized as the nation’s largest free celebration of women in music, will return under new stewardship in 2025, continuing a run that has made it one of Delaware’s most successful and enduring cultural events.
The festival will now be managed by Igniting Delaware Edutainment Association, known as I.D.E.A., a Wilmington-based nonprofit that focuses on education, arts, and community engagement. The transition marks the first change in leadership since the festival’s founding in 2012.
For more than a decade, Ladybug has grown from a small, grassroots showcase on Market Street into a statewide cultural institution, drawing thousands of attendees each year and featuring hundreds of women-fronted bands and solo artists from across the country and abroad. Artists have traveled to Wilmington from more than 20 states and three countries to perform at the free, women-led festival.
The festival was founded and led by Gayle Dillman, whose vision and persistence helped establish Ladybug as a signature summer event in Wilmington and a nationally recognized platform for women in the music industry.
“I’ve been privileged to be a part of The Ladybug Music Festival from the very beginning,” Dillman said in a statement. “It has been my honor to create and nurture this event and watch it grow into something truly special. I’m excited to hand it off to the incredibly capable and creative hands of the I.D.E.A. team.”
Under Dillman’s leadership, Ladybug became known not only for its music but also for its community focus, boosting Wilmington’s creative economy, supporting local businesses and creating an inclusive, family-friendly event that remained free and accessible.

I.D.E.A., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit formed in 2024, said it plans to preserve the festival’s core identity while expanding its reach and programming. The organization is best known locally for producing TEDxWilmington and developing youth-focused “edutainment” initiatives across Delaware.
“The success of Ladybug is a direct result of Gayle Dillman’s vision and the dedication of the team she built over more than a decade,” said Jamie Kleman, board chairwoman of I.D.E.A. “We are deeply inspired by what they created and mindful of the responsibility that comes with stewarding something so meaningful to the community.”
Kleman said the nonprofit’s role is not to reinvent the festival, but to build carefully on the foundation already in place.
“Our work begins with honoring Gayle and her team — their values, their standards, and their belief in women artists,” she said. “Our goal is to support and extend that legacy in a way that stays true to the spirit of Ladybug.”
I.D.E.A. said it is committed to keeping the festival women-led, free to the public, and rooted in Wilmington, with Market Street remaining the heart of the event.
Looking ahead, the organization plans to expand Ladybug beyond a single-day festival into a broader, multi-day experience that includes workshops, artist development programs, entrepreneurship sessions, and community events. The group also plans to introduce year-round Ladybug-branded concerts and programs in other Delaware communities, including Middletown, Milford, Newark and Dover.
Longer-term plans include regional and national expansion, with pop-up festivals, college partnerships, and touring showcases designed to extend Ladybug’s mission beyond Delaware.
Since its debut, Ladybug has positioned itself as more than a concert series, becoming a platform for women’s empowerment and creative entrepreneurship while fostering a strong sense of community pride in Wilmington.

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)A new citizen’s initiative is looking to roll back recreational cannabis use in Maine. 
Maine has allowed for prescribing and limited possession of medical marijuana since 1999, and a successful 2009 referendum established licensed and regulated medical dispensaries. Then, in 2016, Maine voters approved recreational use, retail sale and taxation of cannabis, which the state also refers to as adult use.
However, a newly proposed ballot referendum wants to do away with the commercial cultivation, sale, purchase and manufacture of cannabis starting Jan. 1, 2028. However, it would still allow for personal use and possession of up to 2.5 ounces. 
Colin Mack of Brunswick is listed as the lead petitioner on the Secretary of State’s website; however, he did not respond to a request from Maine Morning Star for comment.
The proposal would also create a streamlined process for people currently licensed under the recreational use program to switch to the medical program and sell any existing recreational products to medical use participants. 
The petition will need about 68,000 signatures by early February to make it onto the 2026 ballot. The number of signatures required represents 10% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in 2022.
Rep. David Boyer (R-Poland), who led the successful 2016 campaign to legalize recreational cannabis, called the petition “shortsighted.” Pointing to research that has found cannabis to be less addictive than alcohol, Boyer said the state’s adult use program has helped Maine’s economy by bringing in tax revenue and creating jobs. 
“How do you put the toothpaste back in the bottle? These Mainers have invested their blood, sweat and tears in these adult use businesses. A lot of them were medical, made that shift to adult use or maybe do both markets. We’re going to put them out of business?” Boyer said.
Since 2021, the adult use retail cannabis program has grown from nearly $82 million in annual sales to more than $243 million in sales last year, according to data provided by the state’s Office of Cannabis Policy. 
There are 180 licensed adult use stores throughout the state, compared to 86 medical dispensaries.
In addition to funneling use back into the medical program, the initiative also wants to create testing and tracking requirements for the medical use cannabis program to detect any harmful contaminants in the cannabis or cannabis products. 
Boyer said these regulations would be “overly burdensome.”
The adult use program already tests for six categories of contaminants. For every 50 samples that were tested in the third quarter this year, about three of them were found to have at least one contaminant exceeding the level permitted in statute.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/marijuana-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 11:57:20.107625

New data from the Pew Research Center found only 17% of Americans believe that what the government does is right either “just about always” or “most of the time,” hitting one of the lowest points Pew has seen since first asking this question in 1958. And according to a DataHaven survey, Connecticut residents trust the federal government less than state or local institutions.
While these are some of the lowest polling numbers seen in American history, national trust in the federal government has been on the decline for decades. Public trust initially dropped in the 1960s and ’70s during the Vietnam War from a near 80% but began rising again in the 1980s into the early ’90s. Trust peaked again after 9/11 before falling.
The DataHaven survey found that of all Connecticut residents surveyed, only 9% trust the federal government “a great deal” to look out for the best interests of them and their family. About 28% trust the federal government “a fair amount.”
Federal government trust among Connecticut residents was at its highest in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the federal stimulus programs and child tax credit were active.
The DataHaven survey also asked about trust in local and state government. Connecticut residents generally trust these institutions more than they trust the federal government, the survey found.
Trust in the local governments was higher than trust in both state and federal, with 67% of residents surveyed trusting their local government “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”
And when it came to state government, 61% of residents trust the state “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”

With two-thirds of U.S. caregivers struggling to manage both employment and home duties, experts say planning, boundaries, and support can prevent burnout.
For thousands of Delawareans, caring for an aging or ill loved one is among the most meaningful roles they will ever take on — and also one of the most demanding. The constant pull of work obligations, family responsibilities, and the daily needs of someone who depends on you can feel like a relentless juggling act.
According to a recent AARP and S&P Global survey, 67% of family caregivers say they are struggling to manage both work and care, often feeling stretched thin and unsure how to stay ahead of it all. Many caregivers routinely experience stress, guilt, frustration, sadness, and emotional exhaustion, becoming overwhelmed by the daily decisions and responsibilities that caregiving requires.
This article — the sixth in a continuing series on the caregiver’s experience — explores practical strategies for balancing competing pressures while protecting your own well-being. Insights from national research and guidance from Delaware Hospice, Oasis Senior Care (a leading consultant for families), and Easterseals Delaware & Maryland’s Eastern Shore underscore a central message: you don’t have to do this alone, and thriving — not just surviving — is possible.
At Home: Building a Support System That Works
Caregiving is rarely meant to be a one-person job, even though many caregivers feel forced into that role. Experts recommend stepping back and making a clear-eyed assessment of what your loved one truly needs — and what tasks might be shared.
Seek Support and Share the Load
Delaware Hospice encourages caregivers to begin by listing daily and weekly care needs and identifying which tasks can realistically be delegated. That may mean asking a sibling to handle financial paperwork, a neighbor to assist with transportation, or hiring part-time in-home support.
When family members live far away or cannot provide hands-on care, asking them to share in financial support — such as covering a few hours of respite care — can significantly reduce stress.
When others offer help, be specific. Instead of a general response, try:“Can you come over Tuesday at noon to help with lunch?”
Clear requests make it easier for others to step in meaningfully.
Prepare for the Unexpected
Health changes, sudden hospital trips, and equipment malfunctions are part of the caregiving reality. Preparing in advance reduces panic when emergencies arise.
Experts recommend:


Keeping medical, legal, and financial documents up to date


Creating a list of trusted helpers for home maintenance or repairs


Maintaining a folder with medications, emergency contacts, and care instructions


When the unexpected happens, preparation allows for calmer decisions and greater peace of mind.
Protect Your Own Health
Caregivers often put themselves last — yet burnout is one of the greatest risks. Even small, scheduled breaks can help reset both body and mind.
Think of self-care as a daily practice, not a luxury:


A 20-minute walk


Quiet reading before bed


Stretching or light exercise


Time with a pet or favorite hobby


Take time to truly enjoy that cup of coffee or tea — not while multitasking, but simply being present.
Crystal Baynard, of Easter Seals also recommends scheduling time for yourself — daily, weekly, or monthly.  “As a caregiver myself and someone who works for the Easterseals Community Outreach Program, my personal thoughts on caregiving support what you already have written.  Most caregivers fully devote themselves to the role of supporting and providing for their loved one. Having connections of their own by socializing with friends or family, finding the right support group, and not ignoring signs stress or burnout are critical to the journey,” insists Baynard. 
Caregivers are also encouraged to resist the urge to be “perfect.” No one can maintain an immaculate home, a full-time career, a perfectly stocked pantry, and be a caregiver — all at once. It is neither realistic nor necessary.
Equally important: do not compare your situation to others. Every caregiving journey is unique. Guilt over what hasn’t been accomplished only adds unnecessary weight.
At Work: Communicating Clearly and Knowing Your Rights
Balancing employment alongside caregiving is a major source of stress, but open communication and workplace flexibility can make a meaningful difference.
Talk With Your Employer
Experts say transparency can prevent misunderstandings about performance, attendance, or availability. Many workplaces offer options such as:


Flexible or adjusted hours


Remote or hybrid schedules


Extended lunch breaks for caregiving tasks


Employee Assistance Programs


A conversation with an HR representative may reveal benefits or accommodations you didn’t realize were available.
Inform and Lean on Colleagues
Letting coworkers know about your caregiving role can remove stigma and reduce misperceptions about commitment. It may also open the door to informal support — many colleagues are navigating caregiving responsibilities themselves.
Know Your Legal Protections
If your workplace has 50 or more employees, you may qualify for unpaid, job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).Additionally, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects caregivers from discrimination, including being passed over for promotions because of family responsibilities.
Understanding these protections allows caregivers to manage their responsibilities without fear of risking their job or career progress.
Managing Stress: Tools and Techniques for Long-Term Balance
Caregiving stress is not only emotional — it affects physical health, decision-making, and relationships. Chronic stress can lead to serious health issues. Recognizing warning signs and lowering stress early can improve overall well-being.
Time Management and Organization
Digital tools and simple routines can bring structure to chaotic days:


Use shared calendars such as Google Calendar or Outlook


Try caregiving apps like CareZone for medication tracking and reminders


Group similar tasks together to conserve mental energy


Breaking large responsibilities into smaller, achievable steps helps reduce overwhelm.
Mindfulness and Mental Health
Practices such as deep breathing, meditation, journaling, or creative hobbies provide valuable emotional release.Professional counseling and caregiver support groups — both virtual and in person — offer coping strategies and reassurance that you are not alone.
Caregiver support groups, in particular, help reduce isolation by connecting people facing similar challenges. Many caregivers say others don’t fully understand their experience unless they, too, are caregivers. Local groups meet both in person and online to maximize access.
Stay Connected
Isolation is one of the hidden challenges of caregiving. Maintaining social connections — even brief ones — combats loneliness and restores perspective.
Acknowledge Your Limits
Fatigue, irritability, sadness, or withdrawal are common signs of burnout. Delaying help only worsens these conditions. Caregivers who recognize their limits and reach out early are better equipped to sustain care over the long term.
The Takeaway: You Can’t Pour from an Empty Cup
Lynn Paxson of Oasis Senior Advisors of Delaware reminds caregivers that balancing work, family, and caregiving is not about perfection. It’s about creating routines, setting boundaries, asking for help, and recognizing that caregiving will never be one-size-fits-all.
Caregivers who plan ahead, seek support, and prioritize their own health are better able to provide compassionate, consistent care for those they love.
This series will continue to explore issues facing caregivers, including financial planning, navigating difficult emotions, using respite services, and preparing for later stages of care.
If you are a caregiver, remember: you are doing one of the hardest — and most important — jobs there is. And you don’t have to do it alone.And if you know a caregiver, reach out — and help them understand that support is available.

(Reworld application to Unified Government of Wyandotte County planning commission)TOPEKA — A global industrial waste company that sought to open a recycling facility in a historic Kansas City, Kansas, neighborhood withdrew its plans after organized opposition from environmental activists and community advocates.
Reworld, which manages industrial waste and converts it into energy, honed in on the city’s Armourdale neighborhood for its new processing facility and said four months ago it was “excited” to work in the Kansas City community.
But the company quietly withdrew its petition Nov. 10, before it was set to meet again with the Unified Government of Wyandotte County’s planning commission. Company representatives had billed the facility as positive economic development and a sustainable waste management initiative that redirected waste from aging landfills.
Concern from Armourdale residents and environmental activists arose when Reworld representatives did not address potential flood risks, traffic volumes and health effects.
“This win belongs to the people,” said Beto Lugo Martinez, executive director of the local environmental group RiSE4EJ.
The opposition effort involved neighbors who spoke at public meetings, translated messages, posted flyers, gathered signatures, counted trucks and made calls, he said.
“It’s proof that grassroots power works and that when communities come together, we can protect our health, our air and our future,” Lugo Martinez said.
The city-county planning commission delayed its decision on Reworld’s requested special use permit in August until the company addressed some of the neighbor’s concerns.
The company was set to go before the commission the same day it withdrew its plans.
Linda Ribakusky, a spokesperson for Reworld said in a statement: “Reworld has withdrawn its application for the proposed Kansas City material processing facility because of changing business circumstances.”
“Reworld remains committed to driving innovation in resource recovery,” she said.

The sponsors say it would save New Jersey's cultural hallmarks. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Two New Jersey lawmakers have proposed a bill that would extend new tax breaks to New Jersey diners in a bid to counter post-pandemic slowdowns and inflation.
The bill, dubbed the “Saving Our Diners and Protecting Our Past Act,” would exempt qualifying diners from New Jersey’s sales tax and create new tax credits for the state’s historic diners and other restaurants. It is sponsored by Sen. Paul Moriarty (D-Gloucester) and Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden).
“They’re kind of the history and culture of many of our communities and kind of a symbol of our state, and I thought we could do something to maybe help them, preserve them, and keep them from closing,” Moriarty said.
NJ Senate panel advances bill banning dog, cat sales at pet stores

The sponsors said diners — something of a cultural hallmark in New Jersey — need the assistance amid rising costs and shifting consumer patterns that have pushed some establishments that have operated for decades to close. Those closures include, among several others, the 58-year-old Cherry Hill Diner, the 38-year-old Townsquare Diner, and the 85-year-old Miss America Diner.
“This does two things: It preserves an institution that New Jersey is known for as part of our historical culture, and it also addresses an issue of affordability, not just for those small business owners, but for their patrons,” said Greenwald, the Assembly’s majority leader.
Even diners that remain operational face challenges, the two men said.
Some that used to operate 24/7 have slimmed their schedules or cut menu offerings, Moriarty said, and others dropped dinner service altogether to help make ends meet.
“There’s one right down the street from where my office is that used to be open seven days a week and have long hours,” Moriarty said. “Now they’re open six days a week, and they’re only open until two in the afternoon.”
The legislation would allow qualifying diners and restaurants that have been operating continuously for at least 25 years — not counting pandemic shutdown interruptions — to apply to be added to an annual registry of historic eateries.
Presence on that registry would exempt them from sales tax levies on sales of food and beverages consumed on site for a year, and they could renew that exemption by reapplying to the registry annually.
Restaurants and diners on the registry could also obtain two non-refundable tax credits worth up to $25,000 each.
Those credits, which would be applied to gross income tax and corporate business tax bills, would equal 10% of an eatery’s spending on ingredients used for meals or drinks, to a cap of $25,000.
To be eligible for the tax breaks, diners and restaurants must be small businesses under federal law. Restaurants can only obtain the exemptions and tax credits if they are family-owned.
The bill is not expected to pass during the current legislative session, which ends in mid-January, Moriarty said. That means diners and restaurants would have to wait until at least Jan. 1, 2027, to take advantage of the bill’s exemption and credits, if it becomes law.
Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
It’s not clear how much the exemption and tax credits will cost the state in foregone revenue. The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services has not yet completed a fiscal note to estimate its costs. Greenwald suggested the tax breaks would not overstrain state coffers.
“This is not going to break the bank. I think if you look at what it can generate by the rejuvenation of people going to these landmarks, as well as maybe new and young restaurant owners who want to come in and take over some of these businesses, I think it can create a stimulus of the economy,” he said.
Moriarty said he expects hundreds of diners and restaurants to qualify for a spot on the registry and its tax benefits, though it’s not clear how many of them would qualify for the full value of the tax credits by spending at least $250,000 on ingredients.
Businesses on the registry that cannot use the full value of their tax credits in a given year because they would reduce their tax liability below zero or statutory minimums, in the case of the corporate business tax, can apply them to taxes billed in up to seven future years.
They could also trade or sell those tax credits to other firms, which could apply them to income tax bills in up to three future years, or six future years for corporate tax bills.

Ohio Senate Republicans lawmakers passed Ohio Senate Bill 56 earlier this week, sending the bill to DeWine’s desk. If DeWine signs the bill into law before the new year, it could take effect as soon as March. 
This comes after DeWine has been urging Ohio lawmakers to regulate or ban delta-8 THC products since January 2024. 
Intoxicating hemp products are items that contain THC that are sold anywhere other than licensed marijuana dispensaries including gas stations, smoke shops, and CBD stores, among others. 
“It was a long time coming, but it’s a major victory,” DeWine said. “(Kids) won’t be able to have juiced-up, hemp gummies, and you won’t be able to walk into a gas station and let an 11-year-old go buy the stuff. That, to me, is the most important part of the bill.”
Children’s safety was DeWine’s biggest concern with intoxicating hemp products.
The Ohio Poison Control Center reported in January 2024 that there had been at least 257 reports of delta-8 poisoning in Ohio in recent years — including 102 in 2023 and 40 that involved children under six-years-old. 
DeWine tried to take matters into his own hands earlier this year when he announced a 90-day executive order that banned the sale of intoxicating hemp products.
The executive order started on Oct.14, but a Franklin County Court of Common judge placed a temporary restraining order on DeWine’s ban through January. The next hearing in this case is scheduled for Jan. 29.
Ohio S.B. 56 complies with recent federal changes by banning intoxicating hemp products from being sold outside of a licensed marijuana dispensary. 
Congress voted to ban products that contain 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container when they voted to reopen the government. Previously, the 2018 Farm Bill said hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC.
There is a one-year implementation delay for the federal hemp ban, but states can create their own regulatory framework before then.
The Ohio bill also allows five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed, and sold until Dec. 31, 2026. 
Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, originally introduced the bill, which also makes changes to Ohio’s marijuana law. 
It would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
Part of the probable cause portions were removed from the bill, but some of it still remains. 
The bill prohibits possessing marijuana in anything outside of its original packaging and criminalizes bringing legal marijuana from another state back to Ohio. 
Ohio S.B. 56 would also give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries.
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote. Sales started in August 2024 and exceeded $702.5 million in the first year. 
When asked about the marijuana portions of the bill, DeWine said he had “not gone through the whole bill.”

Limayem, now president of the University of North Florida, succeeds retiring President Rhea Law amid a broader shakeup statewide of public university presidents. He will be USF’s ninth president.
The contract between Limayem and the Tampa institution is for a five-year term with a base salary of $1.25 million.

“Thank you for the trust and confidence you have placed in me. I’m truly just honored, humble, energized, and just fully aware of the responsibility this confirmation carries,” Limayem said during Friday’s remote Board of Governors meeting, adorned in academic regalia ahead of UNF’s graduation ceremony.
“You have my word that I will lead with transparency, community, and purpose. Every decision I make will be guided by one question: What is best for our students, our faculty, staff, our community, our state, and our country?”
He thanked his UNF colleagues and USF trustees, retelling how he came to America from Tunisia.
“I came to this country from Africa with a very, very modest background because I believed in the power of education to change lives,” he added.
Limayem is one of a few nonpolitical figures to lead state universities under Gov. Ron DeSantis, who’s long-championed his “war on woke” at the higher education level.
Since DeSantis took office, former GOP lawmakers or allies to the governor have assumed university presidencies, including former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez at FIU, former Education Commissioner and state Sen. Manny Diaz Jr. at UWF, former state Rep. Adam Hasner at FAU, former Education Commissioner and former Senate President Richard Corcoran at New College, and state Board of Education Chair Marva Johnson at FAMU.
Limayem is eligible for a performance bonus of up to 50% of his base salary, putting his cash total at $1.87 million annually before other benefits. 
He will receive $18,000 annually to pay for his car and the university will pay his auto insurance. The university will pay $144,000 annually toward a housing stipend. A one-time moving stipend of $50,000, too. Additionally, Limayem will receive deferred compensation of 25% of base salary.

In February, Law announced she would step down at the conclusion of a presidential search. She spent more than 40 years as a student, volunteer, board member, and president at the institution. 
Limayem leaving his post as president at University of North Florida kicks off a search at that school.
Part of Limayem’s first few months will be navigating a legislative session, which includes DeSantis’ proposal to hand all of USF’s Sarasota-Manatee campus facilities over to New College of Florida.
USF Board of Trustees Chair Will Weatherford, a former Florida House Speaker, chimed in on the governor’s proposal during a trustee meeting Thursday.
“This is a policy matter that’s going to be discussed, debated, and worked through over the coming months of the legislative session. We don’t control the outcome of that discussion, but I also want to say, it’s a process, this is the very beginning of the process,” Weatherford said, going on to add there’s “a lot of ball to be played.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251021-UCM-Limayem-BOT-Confirmation-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 10:57:51.532386

The state is hoping to put a stop to the turnover through proposed rules that will be open for public comment starting Monday through Jan. 14. 
Regulators first introduced the rules last December and have since held two opportunities for public input, before submitting them to the Missouri Secretary of State in November.
The microbusiness program — sometimes called the social-equity cannabis program — was designed to boost opportunities in the industry for people in disadvantaged communities that have been most impacted by the war on drugs. It began in 2023, after passing as part of the constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana in 2022.
For the last two years, The Independent has documented a pattern of well-connected groups and individuals flooding the microbusiness lottery by recruiting people to submit applications and then offering them contracts that limit their profit and control of the business. 
Of the 105 microbusiness licenses issued so far, 35 have been revoked, including 22 that involved contracts drafted by St. Louis-based Armstrong Teasdale law firm.
Missouri lawyer for cannabis trade group behind contracts tied to revoked licenses

In order to prevent the continued cascade of revocations, the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation is proposing to adjust when its extensive application-review period occurs. The point when regulators would review questionable contracts would take place before the license is issued, instead of afterwards as it is now.
The rules would also be changed to clarify that “owners, agents or representatives” of a microbusiness application or license that regulators have denied or revoked would be prohibited from holding a voting or financial interest in any other microbusiness license.
The designated-contact role was envisioned as a way to ensure clear communication between the state and licensees. However, regulators found in their investigations that designated contacts have kept the actual eligible applicants in the dark about business and license dealings. The new rules would require the designated contact for a microbusiness applicant to be a majority owner of the microbusiness license.  
According to court documents, some applicants of the revoked licenses told regulators they were going to be “one of three managers,” leaving them without majority voting power in the business. And they did not demonstrate they had “a credible intent or ability to be the majority owner and operator” of the business, regulators found.
Under the new rules, “majority owned and operated” would be defined as the eligible individuals who are listed as having majority ownership must have a level of operational control that would be expected of an owner.  
Eligible individuals must have the power to order or direct the management, managers, and policies of the license, enter into agreements on behalf of the license, and otherwise make decisions for the business.
“A purported owner with little to no knowledge, control, agency or decision-making authority in an application or license does not meet the intent or meaning of the” constitutional amendment that created the microbusiness program, according to the press release the division issued when it introduced the rules last year.
Applicants would also be required to take an online training course that addresses predatory practices and funding opportunities.
The division expects to file the final version of rule amendments for formal rulemaking in early 2026, prior to the third round of microbusiness licensing.
 The contracts

An investigation by The Independent in October revealed that the attorney who crafted most contracts at the heart of the recent license revocations also represents the marijuana industry trade group.
Eric Walter is a St. Louis-based attorney who represents the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association and a significant percentage of the state’s cannabis licensees. 
He wrote 22 agreements the state believes would take the microbusiness licenses out of the hands of eligible applicants and put them into the hands of well-connected or out-of-state cannabis investors, according to the administrative appeal case documents obtained by The Independent.
Each of those agreements largely led to the state revoking a microbusiness license issued last year for not meeting the constitutional mandate that the licenses be “majority owned and operated” by eligible applicants.  All but one of the license revocations is being appealed to the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission. 
To be eligible for a microbusiness license, applicants must meet certain criteria, including income below certain thresholds, having past marijuana offenses or being a disabled veteran.
The contracts written by Walter gave applicants two years to pay back loans that can total up to $2 million. If they couldn’t, they’d have to pay a “break-up fee” of up to $2.5 million or give up ownership of the license transfers to the loan holder, according to the state’s response in several of the appeals. 
“Therefore, the business would likely be unable to generate revenue to pay back the loan,” the state argues in one of the legal filing responding to a revocation appeal. “This leaves them no option but to convert the debt into ownership.”
In most cases, the same people involved in the consulting company that hired Armstrong Teasdale to draw up the contract are also involved in lending the money.
Walter’s law firm and the consulting companies who hired the firm to draw up the agreements have vehemently denied the contracts are predatory, arguing the applicants voluntarily signed them.
“Those documents are all transparent, fair, and compliant with Missouri law, including the Department of Health and Senior Services’ rules,” Jamie Moss, spokeswoman for Walter’s law firm, Armstrong Teasdale, said in an email to The Independent in October.
Under the new rules, regulators will specifically ask for any business agreements related to the license “that affect ownership, control, or financial interests in cannabis operations,” including all management agreements, consulting agreements, partnership agreements, loans, “or other agreements whereby any entities stand to gain financially from the business.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5798-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 10:57:51.532386

Wes Moore (D) vetoed the RENEW Act in May over its cost, but announced Friday that he will allocate nearly the same amount of money to achieve the same goals as in the bill. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) will announce Friday that he is allocating nearly $500,000 to study the costs of climate change in the state — just months after he cited cost concerns as he vetoed a bill to spend almost the same amount of money for the same study.
Friday’s expected announcement comes just days before a special legislative session Tuesday, when lawmakers are expected to consider overriding Moore’s veto of the RENEW Act — for Responding to Emergency Needs From Extreme Weather — which included the climate study.
“While the federal government has spent the past year rolling back climate protections and driving up energy costs, Maryland is taking a responsible step toward understanding the true price tag of climate damage,” Moore wrote in a news release Friday.
The bill was part of a larger effort by climate activists in Maryland and across the country to eventually require large fossil fuel companies to compensate states for the effects of climate change, including flooding and extreme heat.
The study Moore is funding, which will be administered by the comptroller’s office, will also evaluate any potential impact to taxpayers if fossil fuel companies are compelled to make compensatory payments to the state. A final report is due by Dec. 1, 2026 — the same deadline as in the vetoed legislation.
It is not clear whether legislators will still pursue an override of the RENEW Act veto, bill sponsor David Fraser-Hidalgo (D-Montgomery) said.
Report: Climate change imperils toxic sites across Chesapeake Bay region

“At the end of the day, I’m just excited to get going on the study,” Fraser-Hidalgo said. “I’ve been working on a version of this bill for five, going on six, years so I’m just excited to move the ball forward.”
Maryland isn’t alone in considering so-called “Make Polluters Pay,” or “climate Superfund” legislation. New York and Vermont have already passed legislation that will ultimately charge fossil fuel firms for a portion of climate damages. In New York, the tab is $75 billion over the next 25 years. Earlier this year, the Trump administration sued both states, challenging the laws, and those cases are ongoing.
In May, Moore shocked lawmakers when he vetoed a variety of studies, including one evaluating slavery reparations for African American Marylanders and another looking into the potential impacts of large-scale data centers in the state.
“Our current budget situation requires us to reconsider bills that create expensive and labor intensive studies,” Moore wrote in a veto letter about the climate study. “While such bills can be a first step to addressing complex issues and allow the signaling of support for an issue, the practice has become so commonplace that it is now a significant financial and staff burden on the state government.”
Since May, when the bill was vetoed, the administration has been able to secure a $30,000 grant from the Rockefeller Family Fund for the climate study. The remaining $470,000 will come from the state’s Strategic Energy Investment Fund over the next two fiscal years, according to the governor’s office. The vetoed bill would have pulled all $500,000 from the SEIF in fiscal 2026.
“Governor Moore has maintained that Maryland doesn’t have to choose between a green economy and a growing economy,” said Moore spokesperson Rhyan Lake. “By leveraging both philanthropic funding and existing state funding sources over two fiscal years to fully fund this study at no expense to Maryland taxpayers, Governor Moore is continuing to take action on climate and build a more sustainable Maryland.”
When Moore vetoed the RENEW bill, climate advocates were shocked, noting that the administration had not previously voiced opposition to the bill. Mike Tidwell, founder of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, called the move “unforgivable.”
But it’s possible that Moore’s about-face will help him to make amends, as Annapolis gears up for its next full legislative session on Jan. 14.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Maryland suffered devastating losses this summer due to climate change. From extreme flooding to heat deaths, the impacts of climate change are costing Marylanders now,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network Action Fund. “We appreciate Governor Moore’s commitment to moving the climate costs study forward.”
Rockefeller Family Fund Director Lee Wasserman said the charity — which focuses on climate change, democracy and economic justice for women — supported the RENEW bill and others like it around the country, and was stunned by Moore’s veto.
“These costs are going to be landing on states including Maryland whether they figure out what they look like ahead of time or not, so it’s hard for me to imagine how achieving a greater understanding of the parameters of those costs could possibly be seen as negative,” Wasserman said. “To the contrary, it seems like good governance 101.”
“I’m less surprised that the governor has decided to backtrack, appropriately so, and give the state the opportunity to really practice good governance,” Wasserman said.
Prior studies have endeavored to tabulate bits and pieces of Maryland’s costs from climate change.
In 2024, the Maryland Department of the Environment estimated that it would take $1 billion per year to meet the state’s emissions reduction goals and transition to 100% clean energy. Amid historic budget shortfalls, the state has not allocated that amount to the effort, even though some programs are underway. Under state law, Maryland must reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels, by 2031.
An April report from the comptroller’s office indicated that Maryland experienced 85 natural disasters between 1980 and 2024, at a cost to the state of $10 billion to $20 billion.
Moore calls lawmakers back for long-anticipated special session next week

“Although extreme weather events have always occurred, scientists can now quantify how much more intense and frequent they have become due to climate change,” read the report. “Maryland can use this emerging science to assess the additional expenditures the state is spending due to anthropogenic climate change.”
That report also cited research from the Center for Climate Integrity, which supports climate Superfund bills, that said trying to build a seawall to protect Maryland’s coastlines from rising seas would cost the state $27.4 billion by 2040.
The RENEW study will be done under a memorandum of understanding between the Maryland Energy Administration and the comptroller’s office, the governor’s news release said. Comptroller Brooke Lierman said the report “will build a roadmap for financial resilience in Maryland amid the challenges of climate change.”
Lawmakers raided the SEIF fund for other uses during this year’s legislative session. The fund — which is supposed to be used on energy projects such as solar panels, EV chargers and energy efficiency upgrades for low-income households — was used to fund a roughly $80 energy bill refund for all of the state’s residential customers, and to help correct a massive state budget deficit.
The SEIF is funded in part by “alternative compliance payments” from electricity suppliers who do not meet the state’s renewable energy mandates. It had ballooned in recent years because it was cheaper for suppliers to make the alternative compliance payments than to buy the required renewable energy credits from clean energy generators.
SEIF revenues went from $52,240 in alternative compliance payments in fiscal 2021 to $318 million by fiscal 2024, according to the fund’s most recent annual report.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_4543-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 10:57:51.532386

(Justin Garcia/Las Cruces Bulletin)New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Thursday filed a brief with the state Public Regulation Commission to oppose the proposed sale of New Mexico Gas Company to a subsidiary of a Louisiana-based private equity firm.
The gas company filed an application last year to be sold for nearly $1.3 billion to private equity firm Bernhard Capital Partners. If approved, Bernhard subsidiary Saturn Utilities Holdco would take over New Mexico Gas Company, which serves more than 500,000 customers in 27 of New Mexico’s 33 counties.
In his PRC filing, Torrez argues that Bernhard’s reliance on short-term investments and private debt could lead to rate hikes; that its “layered corporate structure” poses a threat to transparency; and that its “complex web” of holding companies could thwart regulators’ oversight.
“The proposed acquisition raises real risks of higher rates, reduced transparency, and long-term financial instability for customers across the state,” Torrez said in a statement. “We are urging regulators to deny this application unless there are significant changes made to safeguard ratepayers from unnecessary costs and hidden liabilities.”
If the deal proceeds, Torrez contends that PRC members must enact restrictions on selling utility assets without PRC approval; offer rate credits for low-income customers; require competitive cost analyses before implementing new IT systems; and require funding for a “severe weather reliability fund” to protect ratepayers during hazardous weather.
A spokesperson for Bernhard Capital Partners in an email to Source NM said the firm has been “committed to active participation throughout the regulatory process.”
“Our application includes nearly $87 million in direct benefits to local communities, employees, and organizations. These commitments have been informed by feedback from these same stakeholders throughout the regulatory process,” the spokesperson wrote. “This includes $22 million in rate credits for customers, $7 million to assist families who need help paying their utility bills, and more than $2 million in charitable giving to local nonprofits. We’ve also committed $15 million to advancing community priorities, like economic development, workforce training, and renewable energy projects.”
Torrez is the latest public official to oppose the proposed sale. In November, state Sen. Harold Pope Jr. (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) spoke before the commission and took exception to the exclusion of information relating to other companies previously owned by Bernhard Capital Partners’ founder.
New Mexico lawmakers Pope, McQueen raise questions about New Mexico Gas Company sale

Specifically, a 2008 U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General report said FEMA wasted millions by awarding no-bid contracts to the Shaw Group — a firm previously run by Bernhard’s founder — and others. A 2011 report commissioned by state leaders in Louisiana alleged that Shaw appeared to overbill the state by nearly $500,000 for building sand berms along the coastline to prevent oil from the infamous BP spill from washing onto the land.
“Right now, central evidence about Bernhard Capital Partners’ regulatory compliance history including violations, fines, audits and settlements involving their affiliates and formerly owned companies has been withheld from the record,” Pope told commissioners in November. “You cannot reliably weigh benefits against risk when the most relevant facts are kept from the public.”
The companies initially had a deadline to finalize a sale agreement in November, but recently extended it to Feb. 5.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 10:57:51.532386

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images).On Tuesday, a set of Democratic senators introduced a set of policies to incorporate virtual power plants into the state’s energy system. 
Virtual power plants aggregate distributed energy resources, like rooftop solar panels and battery storage, to help meet changes in energy demand. These systems can help circumvent demand for peaker plants, which only run when energy demand is at its highest, and can help even out fluctuations in energy supply generated through wind or solar.
Put forth by Sen. Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township) and Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor, Senate Bill 731 would create the legal framework needed for these facilities to operate, while Senate Bill 732 would instruct the Michigan Public Service Commission – which regulates the state’s energy companies – to establish regulations requiring utility companies to incorporate these resources into their plans for distributing and transmitting energy.
‘Valuable and largely overlooked:’ Interest in virtual power plants grows

If passed, the virtual power plant aggregators and the owners of the energy resources would be compensated for the benefits their systems provide to the energy grid.
“We can’t meet our state’s future energy needs with 20th-century infrastructure,” Shink said in a statement. “This legislation will help us create the flexibility and reliability to rise to modern energy challenges.”
In 2023, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed off on a set of laws to transition the state to clean energy, including requirements for energy companies to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.
The state urgently needs to improve its reliability and move away from energy resources that are driving climate change, Irwin said.

(Photo by Guido Mieth/Getty Images)Since my husband and I went public with our family’s story about our son’s severe mental illness, my phone, inbox, and social media messages have been full. People reach out constantly — some looking for help for themselves, others desperate to find treatment for a loved one.
They come from every corner of Iowa, and beyond. Some ask if they can share my contact information with a friend, neighbor, a coworker in crisis or even a constituent. My answer is always yes. I do my best to respond, though I can’t always keep up. I try — because I know how much it means to have someone simply answer.
Sometimes the help is straightforward. I can recommend an access center, a provider, a support program, or a specific contact who might make a difference.
Other times, the conversations are anything but simple. Some callers are angry — furious at a system that has let them down. Some sob uncontrollably. Some ramble through the chaos of their loved one’s illness, and I have to listen carefully to piece together enough information to know where to start.
All of them need to be heard. All of them deserve compassion.
But these stories stay with me. They break my heart. They keep me awake at night. They fill me with rage at the injustice of a system that continues to fail people who are sick, scared, and out of options.
And even as I work with providers and advocates across the state — many of whom are deeply dedicated — it’s hard to hear story after story of people being failed by hospitals, agencies, and professionals we trust to help.
It’s devastating to learn about a young woman who died within days of discharge from a psychiatric hospital — her parents, who were her legal guardians, never even notified that she’d been released. We know suicide risk skyrockets in those first days after hospitalization.
It’s infuriating to hear about a man “streeted” from an emergency department because he was psychotic and using drugs—  drugs that were the only thing quieting the voices in his head — because he couldn’t access real treatment, and just kept being streeted by the people who are supposed to help him.
It’s exhausting to advocate for someone who clearly qualifies for an Assertive Community Treatment program, only to be told he’s “too sick” for admission, even though the program’s own criteria say otherwise.
These calls are constant. They come in frequently. I do what I can to connect people to help:
• Office of Recovery Services: 855-622-4692
• Your Life Iowa: 855-581-8111
• 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline
• Iowa Warm Line: 844-775-9276 (Peer-run, non-crisis, 8 a.m.–2 a.m. CST)
• Treatment Advocacy Center Helpline: 703-951-9760
But the calls I truly dread are the ones that come after someone has been arrested for something they did while in untreated psychosis. Once a person is criminalized for being sick, it becomes so much harder to get them treatment instead of punishment.
There is help and information available through the Treatment Advocacy Center’s guide:
Criminal Legal: When mental illness leads to arrest -TAC and Video.
If you’re one of the people reaching out, please know it’s OK to keep doing so (lcarpenter@iamentalhealth.com). I don’t have all the answers, but I will always try to help, to listen, and to keep pushing for a system that treats people with severe mental illness with dignity and care.
I believe it will get better — but only if more people care enough to speak out, to get involved, and to refuse to accept the way things are.
If you’re ready to be part of that change, I hope you’ll consider signing up for updates from NAMI Iowa ( NAMI Iowa Newsletter Sign Up ) and the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC Action Center – Treatment Advocacy Center )
Every voice matters—and every call for change helps bring us one step closer to a system that truly helps the people who need it most.

Growing up in a grocery store in the Arkansas Delta resulted in a part of my DNA being formed with the smell of freshly sliced bologna and the clinking of ice in the ice box that kept drinks cold. One of my favorite memories was standing on a Coke case selling the drinks and baked goods to customers of all ages.
Country stores are mostly memories of bygone days, but in my case, I learned many life lessons spending my preschool years there. My daddy was owner and proprietor of the store that served mostly farm workers, community residents and individuals who used the store as a bus stop for trips to bigger cities like Memphis. In his 50 years running the store, he was familiar with multigenerational families, and many of them considered him family.
Early on, I saw hardworking people going to the fields every day —  rain or shine — with a cotton sack or hoe. Not to be overly dramatic but I knew even then, if you did not eat, you could not be healthy enough to work. I got into the food business before food stamps were a staple.
In the 1950s at our store, the real currency was credit, trust and the monthly payments made by patrons when they were paid. Daddy kept a ticket on each credit customer, and with nothing more than a cigar box and his own accounting system, he maintained meticulous records. I never saw a dispute with a customer.
Life changed over time. The ice box was replaced with a refrigerated cooler, and the Coke box was put away. I was trusted to make change, and my payment for helping out was the chance to play the pinball machine.

By the time I left the community, food stamps and cash were prominent means of payment, even though the monthly credit was still an option to regular customers. The type of food changed as new products were promoted on television and added to the basics.
As I became an adolescent, my days of working at the store were replaced by involvement in school activities. But as I became a young adult schoolteacher, I found myself back there holding a makeshift summer kindergarten on the front porch. With more mature eyes, I saw the place and the people differently.
I knew the popsicle from Mr. Raymond’s store was my drawing card for attendance, and it worked. Children walked to the store accompanied by an older child or adult, while the local elementary school principal and a parent with a car transported those who lived too far away to walk. We learned basic skills to be better prepared for first grade.
As a first-grade teacher, I saw starving children eating as much as they could hold in the school cafeteria. With stomachs bulging, we would return to the classroom to digest and hopefully keep it down. I also saw their parents working for a very low wage and trying to navigate the life they had.
Today, many people assume that children no longer live in food-scarce homes. However, according to Feeding America, for the last 19 years at the county level Mississippi has the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. We deserve the rating.
The minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour. The most recent report disseminated by the United Ways in Mississippi underscores the depth of the problem. In 2023, based on the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), 19% of Mississippi households were defined as being in poverty.
Yet this measure failed to account for an additional 30% of the state’s households that were also experiencing financial hardship. These households fall into the ALICE: Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed — earning above the FPL, but not enough to afford basic expenses in the county where they live.
Combined, ALICE households and households living in poverty make up an estimated 49% of Mississippi homes below the ALICE Threshold in 2023. This rate placed Mississippi 50th among all states and the District of Columbia with first representing the lowest rate of hardship. Families below this threshold are forced to make impossible choices — like deciding whether to pay for utilities or a car repair, whether to buy food or fill a prescription.
The history of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP helps explain the hardship many Mississippians face today. It began when unemployment was widespread and there was an agricultural surplus.
From the beginning, its purpose was and still is to supplement the income of working-class families and individuals on fixed incomes due to low wages and high costs of living.
Some of today’s most successful men and women participated in the SNAP or the federal supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, also known as WIC. 
During my son’s pursuit of a master’s degree in theology, he applied for WIC, which is a cousin to SNAP. With a new baby and only one very fixed-income, WIC was a critical supplement to their budget.
Research clearly demonstrates access to healthful, nutritious food during pregnancy and early childhood is essential for a strong start in life. For babies, good prenatal nutrition helps lay the foundation for healthy brain development supporting learning, behavior and mental health well into adulthood.
A balanced diet also builds stronger immune systems, leading to fewer infections and doctor visits. It is important to Mississippians to lower the risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease, which all carry high lifetime medical costs and result in missing work. When adults are frequently sick, the workforce becomes less productive, affecting not only families but the state’s overall economic health.
Mississippi consistently has some of the highest food costs in the nation. It can be difficult for Mississippians to afford healthy foods that help their babies grow up healthy. As of July 1, Mississippi has a grocery tax of 5% while 33 states do not have any.
Mississippi continues to struggle with food deserts, where access to full-service grocery stores is limited and reliable transportation is often unavailable. For many families, the only nearby options are gas stations and dollar stores – places where fresh, nutritious food is scarce.
I have no fight with the state auditor or governor if they want to campaign for cutting food stamps to purchase sugary foods. But I do take issue with the growing atmosphere of disrespect toward the working people who rely on these benefits. These families deserve dignity, not judgment.
When the nation was facing a government shutdown earlier this year, Gov. Tate Reeves talked about requesting a waiver to limit the use of food stamps on sugary products such as drinks and candy even though there were questions of whether there would be any SNAP payments at all. He commented that “welfare benefits are a hand-up for those in desperate temporary need.”
The truth is, there was and still is a desperate need across the state for the full SNAP payments disseminated to participants. Yet during the shutdown, Gov. Reeves was not interested in following the strategy Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry implemented. He used Louisiana state emergency funds to allocate $150 million to supplement SNAP during the shutdown.
This contrast reveals a fatal flaw in Mississippi’s leadership. When the weakest link in the chain of productivity breaks or is damaged, the entire system suffers.
Without healthy workers who keep our streets clean, prepare hotel rooms and staff our restaurants, we will have no tourism, no community growth, no strong tax base and no one to train in the highly publicized high-paying jobs coming into our state.
It seems to be a no-brainer.

Holiday Gift Wrapping a gift is more than covering what is inside. It adds anticipation and shows care. A wrapped present feels thoughtful and personal.
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer | Delaware Live | December 2025
As the holidays arrive in Delaware, the rolls of wrapping paper, shiny ribbons, and neatly tied bows that show up in homes and stores are more than decoration. They are part of a tradition that carries centuries of history. Today wrapping gifts brings joy to families and adds a special touch to local holiday shopping.
Gift Wrap: From Ancient Utility to Holiday Ritual
The earliest known examples of wrapping gifts date back more than two thousand years in China, when paper was first invented to wrap delicate items. Over time wrapping became a sign of respect and ceremony. In other parts of Asia, families used traditional cloth wrappings such as Japanese furoshiki or Korean bojagi to present meaningful gifts. These pieces of fabric were often handmade and intended to be reused.
In the Western world wrapping developed slowly. For many years gifts were simply tucked into cloth sacks or boxes. By the Victorian era, decorated paper and ribbon began appearing in homes during Christmas and other celebrations. Wrapping became part of the excitement and presentation.
The modern wrapping tradition took shape in the early twentieth century in Kansas City, Missouri, where the Hall Brothers operated a small stationery shop. During the Christmas season of 1917, they ran out of their usual white, red, and green tissue paper. Searching for a substitute, the brothers placed sheets of elegant French envelope lining paper on the counter. Shoppers loved the colorful designs and bought every sheet. Sensing an opportunity, the brothers printed their own decorative paper the following year. This simple improvisation eventually grew into Hallmark and helped launch the gift wrap industry as we know it today. Today patterned paper, ribbon, tags, and gift bags are common during holidays and special occasions.
Why We Still Wrap and Why It Matters
Wrapping a gift is more than covering what is inside. It adds anticipation and shows care. A wrapped present feels thoughtful and personal. For many families in Delaware, it is part of the holiday atmosphere. People choose colors, save matching ribbons, and use handwritten tags to make each package feel special.
Shopping local in Delaware also supports the practice. Small boutiques and independent stores in Wilmington, Newark, Lewes, and Rehoboth often offer gift wrapping for purchases during the holiday season. A beautifully wrapped package from a local shop feels warm and memorable before it is even opened.
Whether you are preparing presents at a kitchen table in Middletown, or carrying wrapped gifts home from a coastal shop, the simple act of wrapping connects generations. It turns giving into an experience that is both personal and joyful. The magic is not only in what is inside the box, but also in the care taken to wrap it.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-095330.jpg,,,2025-12-12 10:57:51.532386

A lawsuit filed Thursday claims the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved ConocoPhillips' winter oil exploration plan without adequately considering damages to habitat used by caribou and other wildlife. (Photo by Bob Wick/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)Environmental and Native organizations on Thursday sued the Trump administration to try to overturn last month’s approval of an expansive oil-exploration program on the North Slope.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, said the U.S. Bureau of Land Management violated federal laws when it gave the go-ahead to a ConocoPhillips plan for seismic surveys and exploration drilling this winter on federal lands in Arctic Alaska.
ConocoPhillips’ plans call for seismic surveys in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, along with four exploration wells and associated development. The exploration work is planned near ConocoPhillips’ huge Willow project, which is in development, and its Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, which is already producing oil.
The plaintiffs bringing the lawsuit are Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, the Center for Biological Diversity and The Wilderness Society. They are represented by the environmental law firm Earthjustice.
The lawsuit argues the approval violates the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act, a 1976 law that mandates environmental protection in the reserve, and the Administrative Procedures Act, which concerns the public process for government decision and actions.
The planned program will cause serious environmental damage that will last for several years, including in areas around Teshekpuk Lake, the North Slope’s biggest lake, and the Colville River, known for its raptor populations and paleontological resources. Previous presidential administrations established protections for those sensitive habitats, including the calving site for the caribou herd named for the lake.
“The record shows the exploration program is likely to cause long-term harm to vegetation and soils that provide crucial habitat to caribou, birds, and a host of other wildlife in the Reserve, including to those within the Teshekpuk Lake and Colville River Special Areas,” the lawsuit said. “The exploration program is also likely to cause population-level impacts to the Teshekpuk Caribou Herd, and long-term harm to subsistent hunters and the communities that rely upon them for food security and health and wellbeing.”
The lawsuit faults the BLM and U.S. Department of the Interior for limiting public information about the proposal and, once the proposal was announced, restricting public comment to a mere seven days before concluding that the exploration work would pose no significant environmental harm.
Both the lack of public information and the conclusion were wrong, the plaintiffs said. In their lawsuit they cited expert testimony from Martha Raynolds, a University of Alaska Fairbanks scientist, who said the seismic program would scar the tundra for more than 15 years.
“The company’s plans would crush sensitive Arctic tundra under 95,000-pound thumper trucks, disrupt caribou migration patterns and destroy our ability to enjoy these magnificent lands,” Matt Jackson, Alaska senior manager for The Wilderness Society, said in a statement. “With an administration bent on ignoring the public, our only choice is to turn to the court to defend these public lands for generations to come and ensure that our rural communities remain free to sustain our Alaskan way of life.”

	Seismic surveys use sound waves to help map underground geologic structures. The work is done with vehicles that crisscross the surface. UAF experts have warned for years about the threats to tundra and permafrost from seismic surveys.
Nauri Simmonds, executive director of Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, said the areas targeted for exploration are sensitive and should be protected from development.
“Even among our own Iñupiat relatives who support oil development, there is recognition that some places are too important to risk, too vital to our way of life to be sacrificed. ConocoPhillips’ exploration program is not only an assault on caribou and tundra — it is another chapter in the enfoldment of our people into systems designed to fracture us from within,” she said in the statement.
A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing a policy concerning pending litigation.
Dennis Nuss, a ConocoPhillips spokesperson defended the approvals and criticized the plaintiffs.
“These actions by the same groups that have historically used legal maneuvers to delay exploration and development in the Petroleum Reserve jeopardize hundreds of local jobs and adds unnecessary risk to investment in Alaska,” Nuss said. “We remain confident in the robustness of our plan and BLM’s permits and look forward to completing our work within Alaska’s limited winter exploration season.”
He did not comment on whether ConocoPhillips had started the winter program.
The Willow project, with an estimated 600 million barrels of oil reserves, is expected to start producing oil in 2029. It is slated to be the westernmost producing oil field on the North Slope. The development has been controversial, but its approval by the Biden administration in 2023 has survived legal challenges. Projected revenues to the state from Willow production are now far more modest than previously estimated, according to Alaska Department of Revenue officials.
Production at the Greater Mooses Tooth site started in 2018.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Wisconsin’s health department is reaffirming longstanding recommendations that all newborns get a vaccination for hepatitis B.
The Department of Health Services announced Thursday it has sent a memo to Wisconsin vaccination providers about the vaccine.
Ryan Westergaard, M.D., Wisconsin Dept. of Health Services
“DHS continues to recommend that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, and then go on to complete the standard three-dose series within the first 18 months of life,” said Dr. Ryan Westergaard, chief medical officer in the DHS bureau of communicable diseases, at a media briefing Thursday.
Hepatitis B, a viral infection, can lead to lifelong liver disease, Westergaard said, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.
“Infants and young children are particularly at high risk,” he said. A baby infected with the virus has up to a 90% chance of developing chronic liver disease, he said.
Infants can be exposed during birth or through close contact with adults and caregivers “who may not even know that they carry the virus,” Westergaard added. “That’s why vaccination early in life is so important.”
DHS issued the announcement following a federal shift in vaccine policy, eliminating a recommendation in place since 1991 for newborns to receive the hepatitis B shot. The recommendation was eliminated Dec. 5 in a vote by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In June, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaced all 17 members of the advisory committee with a new group of appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.
CDC vaccine committee overturns decades-old hepatitis B recommendation for newborns

The decision to end the recommendation for all newborns to get the hepatitis B shot dismayed the leaders of  medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“For more than 30 years, the hepatitis B vaccine has been used safely and effectively in newborns,” Westergaard said Thursday. Since the 1991 recommendation was put in place, hepatitis B infections in children have declined by 99%, he said.
“This recommendation is grounded in decades of research showing that the vaccine is safe and effective, and it aligns with guidance of the American Academy of Pediatrics and other leading medical groups,” Westergaard said. “So, our message today is straightforward, hepatitis B and its long-term health consequences are preventable. And routine childhood vaccination remains one of our most effective tools we have to protect children’s health and prevent lifelong disease.”
Westergaard said there has been no change in insurance coverage for the vaccine and that the hepatitis B shot remains among the vaccines available through the Vaccine for Children’s program for patients without health insurance.
ACIP also recommended blood testing for antibodies before giving the rest of the hepatitis B series shots for infants and young children, but Westergaard said that recommendation is not supported by scientific evidence.
The presence of hepatitis B antibodies in adults is a good indicator that they are protected against an infection, he said. “There’s no science suggesting that that same strategy works for newborns and children,” he added.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-12 14:46:07+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Mass. home insurer-of-last resort sees spike in enrollment,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/environment/mass-home-insurer-of-last-resort-sees-spike-in-enrollment/,"Massachusetts's home insurance market, officials and experts stressed, is in a much better place than other parts of the country. Still, signs of change are emerging.","DON’T PULL THE FIRE ALARM YET, but new data on home insurance in Massachusetts is turning heads across the industry. 
Massachusetts enrolled more than 173,000 policies in its insurer-of-last-resort, known as the FAIR Plan, in fiscal year 2024 — marking the first year-over-year increase for the insurer since 2017 and its largest single-year jump since 2007. In fiscal 2023, the FAIR Plan enrolled 158,660 policies. 
“Insurance numbers like these are the canary in the coal mine,” said Charlie Sidoti, a former insurance executive who now serves as executive director of the Cambridge-based nonprofit Innsure, which works with insurers and communities navigating climate risk. “It leads to all sorts of other things — property values dropping, tax bases eroding — which puts financial pressure on municipalities. Ultimately, it could lead to declines in bond ratings. It’s an early, leading indicator of the impacts of climate change flowing through the economy.” 
Insurers around the country are adjusting to a warming world, rising seas, and more costly extreme weather events by canceling policies, issuing nonrenewal notices, and raising premiums in risky areas — and in some cases, exiting states altogether. The trend is creating massive disruptions in homeowners’ ability to afford and access insurance — which provides a crucial backstop in case disaster strikes — and threatens to negatively impact property values.  
Massachusetts, officials and experts stressed, is in a much better place than other parts of the country. The state has a robust market with a number of private insurers offering coverage, though prices have surged throughout New England. And it isn’t suffering from an onslaught of disastrous hurricanes or wildfires like in Florida or California. 
Still, signs of change are emerging.  
The latest data showing the FAIR Plan increases, from the state insurance commissioner’s recently-released annual report, comes on the heels of Massachusetts’s having the fifth-highest nonrenewal rate in the country in 2023, according to a congressional investigation. That nonrenewal rate is driven by areas most vulnerable to severe storms: In Barnstable County, 1 in 16 policies weren’t renewed in 2023. In Dukes County, it’s 1 in 9. 
Statewide, there were 3,483 policy nonrenewals in 2022, 1,300 of which were in coastal areas, according to the state division of insurance. The very next year, that number jumped to 9,248, including a more than tripling of nonrenewals in coastal areas. By 2024, total nonrenewals grew again to more than 13,000.  
Though there are a few factors explaining the increase in FAIR Plan enrollees in 2024, the high nonrenewal rates in 2023 likely drove some homeowners to the state’s insurer-of-last-resort. Insurance Commissioner Michael Caljouw’s report found that 14 out of the top 25 insurance companies in the state implemented measures over the past five years “that were intended to reduce their exposure to climate-related risks,” including by reducing coverage in areas near the coast.  
Chris Stark, executive director of the Massachusetts Insurance Federation, said that global reinsurers — companies that provide insurance for insurance companies — sought to offload some of their riskier policies in the wake of mounting losses for several consecutive years from natural disasters around the world. Massachusetts, a state in which it’s expensive to rebuild, has seen the number of heavy downpours increase 71 percent between 1958 and 2010. 
About 4 in 10 homes on Cape Cod and the islands are now insured through the FAIR Plan — up from 33 percent in 2023. That represents the highest rate for the region since 2017. The coastal Bristol and Plymouth counties, together with the Cape and islands, accounted for about 51 percent of all FAIR Plan policies in 2020. Now, those regions have about 55 percent of all FAIR Plan enrollees after modest upticks in each of the past five years.  
“Over the years, we’ve morphed from primarily an urban plan to now a coastal plan,” said Frank O’Brien, the FAIR Plan’s general counsel.  
Such a change has consequences for the severity of risks and damages for which the plan has to contend.  
“It’s just a huge concentration of risk that’s ultimately backstopped by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth,” said Andrew Gottlieb, executive director of the Association to Preserve Cape Cod. “And depending on the size of the next catastrophe, that may not be feasible. It’s going to be a burden on the state’s budget.” 
Other changes aside from the nonrenewal rates may have led to the increase in FAIR Plan policies. Rising home insurance prices in the private market driven by climate risk and high rebuilding costs due to inflation and tariffs have made the FAIR Plan look more financially attractive, especially to lower and moderate-income households, Stark said. The FAIR Plan hasn’t raised rates since 2006.  
FAIR Plans sprung up around the country in the 1960s in response to, at the time, rioting in American cities that exploded into mushrooming property damages and losses, with Massachusetts’s plan established in 1968. In more recent decades, though, these plans increasingly became focused on properties vulnerable to extreme weather events, like floods that damaged basements and high winds that tore through roofs, as private insurers raised rates and pulled coverage from these areas.  
The Massachusetts FAIR Plan writes its own coverage policies and collects premiums, but it also has the ability levy an assessment against private insurers when massive losses stack up. An assessment, which needs approval from the state insurance division, would force private insurance companies in the state to pay the FAIR Plan money to meet its claims and continue providing coverage. 
While one year of insurance data may be enough to raise eyebrows, it’s not yet prompting a panic.  
There have been more FAIR Plan policies in the past than there are today. In fiscal year 2007, there were about 204,000 policies overall in Massachusetts, compared with the roughly 173,000 last year, and when Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012, there were about 10,000 more policies on Cape Cod than there are now.  
While every Massachusetts county experienced year-over-year growth in FAIR Plan policies between 2023 and 2024 — Worcester saw the largest, a 25 percent spike — the fact that the number of policies statewide has remained roughly between 150,000 and 200,000 for two decades is a testament to the state’s “robust” home insurance market, Stark said. 
Massachusetts’s FAIR Plan also isn’t nearly as strained as plans in other states are. Texas’ insurer-of-last-resort doubled its exposure from $113 million to $237 million and added 41,000 policies just between 2023 and 2024 alone. California’s FAIR Plan, meanwhile, doubled both in policies and the value of properties it insures between 2023 and 2025 as private insurers fled the state following devastating wildfires. 
And the rise in FAIR Plan policies in the Northeast last year wasn’t confined to the Bay State. Neighboring New York and Rhode Island saw FAIR Plan increases in 2024 by 7 and 19 percent, respectively, compared to Massachusetts’s 9 percent growth.  
“It was disturbing to see this pretty significant spike,” said Jonathan Schreiber, associate vice president of state government relations at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. “But this is one year, so we need more data to understand if this is a new trend. Climate change is certainly here to stay, but there are other economic factors that hopefully can improve, as well as steps communities and individual homeowners can take to mitigate climate risk.” 
Now that private insurers have made moves to rebalance their risk portfolios, Stark is hopeful that the 2024 growth in FAIR Plan policies proves to be more of a blip and that the market will stabilize in the years ahead. 
“We’re not Louisiana or Florida or California in terms of what the homeowners insurance market is looking like right now,” Stark said. “But we also don’t want to see this trend of year-over-year growth in the FAIR Plan continue.” 
Despite the relative health of the Massachusetts home insurance market, the thought of a catastrophic storm battering the Bay State’s shores — something it has largely avoided in recent history — still keeps insurance experts on guard, particularly with the FAIR Plan increasingly exposed on the coast. O’Brien said it’s unlikely at this time that the FAIR Plan would need to issue an assessment to pay claims should damages pile up following such a severe storm. 
“However, we’re weather-dependent. That’s the business of insurance,” O’Brien said. “You hope for the best, you plan for the worst, and at the end of the day, we’re taking on a risk that people can’t take on by themselves, so you just try to be prepared.” 
The new data is prompting some to think about the mission of the FAIR Plan in the first place. Dominick Dusseau, research associate at the Falmouth-based Woodwell Climate Research Center, said the plan in some ways is trying to serve conflicting purposes: be both an insurer of last resort for homeowners rejected by the private market and provide affordable coverage.  
When the FAIR Plan is competitive with private insurers, people will flock there, forcing the private market to spread risk over fewer people, raise rates, and reduce their coverage in certain areas — fueling a cycle that could push more people into the FAIR Plan, especially in the state’s most vulnerable areas, he said. A devastating storm could increase the potential for an assessment, which private insurers would pass on to their customers.  
“It’s a scary thought,” Dusseau said. 
Still, Dusseau said the state is doing a decent job at striking that balance given the number of private insurers still offering coverage in Massachusetts. And he credited the FAIR Plan’s coverage cap of $1 million per home as an effective tool at keeping its potential exposures in check, given the otherwise high cost of rebuilding some of the more lavish properties dotting the coast.  
But the future impacts of climate change will test the state’s insurance system and have implications for where and how to build for decades to come. 
“Like a lot of things that were developed to respond to one set of circumstances, the FAIR Plan is not necessarily so well-tuned to apply to the rapidity of change that we’re seeing in climate and the huge increases in risk profile,” said Gottlieb of the Association to Preserve Cape Cod. “What you’ve got happening here is a massive shifting of the risk and the cost associated with remediating the risk when the storm hits to the public sector.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Flooding5.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-12 09:57:55.764737

The Republican-controlled state Senate voted 31-19 on Thursday to defeat the redistricting bill — a measure Trump and others had pushed for months as a way to carve Indiana’s congressional map to potentially yield two additional Republican seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
In a rare rebuke of Trump from within his own party, 21 of Indiana’s Republican senators joined all 10 Democrats in voting down the proposal, ensuring it can’t be revived until the 2027 session. Nineteen GOP senators voted in favor of the bill.
The outcome was met with fierce criticism from state and national Republican leaders who helped drive the effort. 
Comments came from Trump, Gov. Mike Braun and national GOP leadership signaled potential retaliation against lawmakers who broke ranks.
Reactions From Washington
Minutes after the vote, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson addressed reporters at the U.S. Capitol, pushing back on the notion that Thursday’s result reflected a weakening of Trump’s influence. 
Johnson said the Indiana vote was “inconsequential to that” and insisted the GOP will prevail in next year’s midterm elections, regardless of how individual states vote.
He also refuted suggestions that Trump is a “lame duck,” calling him “the most powerful president of this generation and many others,” and downplayed the Indiana effort, saying the president “did not put in a major pressure campaign for it.”
Senate Republicans reject Trump’s plea for gerrymandered maps

“He let his opinion be known — as he does on everything all the time, all day long. We win some, we lose some,” Johnson continued. “We’re going to win on whatever maps are presented. … “I’m very bullish. I’m more bullish today than I was yesterday.”
Trump and White House officials had numerous calls with Senate Republicans and Vice President JD Vance traveled to Indiana twice to push the effort.
Trump himself, speaking from the Oval Office, lamented the rejection of Indiana’s proposed map and targeted Senate leadership. The president specifically named Republican Senate Pro Tem Rodric Bray, who voted against the measure and said repeatedly in recent months that too few GOP senators supported the mid-decade redistricting for it to pass.
“You had one gentleman, the head of the Senate, I guess Bray, whatever his name is … He’ll probably lose his next primary, whenever that is,” Trump said, adding that Indiana’s Republican Senate “has done a tremendous disservice.” 
“I’ll certainly support anybody that wants to go against him,” he added. 
The president also asserted that his strong electoral performance in Indiana should have translated into support for his redistricting push.
“It’s funny, because I won Indiana all three times by a landslide, and I wasn’t working on it very hard. It would have been nice. I think we would have picked up two seats if we did that,” he continued. “(Indiana) is a great place. I love the people there, they love me. We won in a landslide all three times. I got tremendous votes — record votes. … There’s no reason for (not redistricting).”










I’ll certainly support anybody that wants to go against him.

On social media, Trump’s allies and conservative advocacy groups amplified the pressure. 
Heritage Action — the advocacy and lobbying arm of The Heritage Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank — posted just hours before the vote that “if the Indiana Senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state. Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop.”
Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith echoed that assertion, saying in a post on X Thursday night that the Trump administration was “VERY clear” in its warnings to state lawmakers and the governor that a failed map could bring consequences. Beckwith deleted the post Friday morning.
“They told many lawmakers, cabinet members and the (governor) and I that this would happen,” Beckwith said in the since-deleted post. “The Indiana Senate made it clear to the Trump Admin today that they do not want to be partners with the (White House). The (White House) made it clear to them that they’d oblige.”
Other threats on the horizon
Republican U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana’s 3rd Congressional District, appearing on CNN Thursday night, also lamented the Senate’s decision. He described the vote as “a terrible decision” and tied it to broader concerns about cooperation with the federal delegation.

“I’m really disappointed. … We have a lot of projects that we’ve been working on in Indiana. And … just like in business, you work with people who work with you. And President Trump asked for this. Speaker Mike Johnson, he put a ton of time making phone calls. There was pushing, pulling,” Stutzman said. “There was no good excuse that I heard other than, ‘This just breaks precedent,’ or ‘The president was being a bully about it.’ This is politics. I mean, this is hardball, and we’re playing softball.”
“My belief,” he added, “is that (Trump) is going to look at Indiana and say, ‘Look, we want to work together, but I need your help, and the state Senate failed to help today.’ … Unfortunately, we just don’t have a state senate that sees the big picture and understands the national implications of this.”
But when pressed on the notion that Indiana should be denied federal funding absent redistricting support, Stutzman objected. 
“No, I mean, I hope not,” he said. “I want to work with the president.”
Braun additionally wasted little time signaling political repercussions for Republicans who opposed the measure, saying in a statement shortly after the vote that the senators who “partnered with Democrats to reject this opportunity” had failed Hoosiers and would face consequences.
“I will be working with the President to challenge these people who do not represent the best interests of Hoosiers,” Braun said in a Thursday evening statement.
Despite the barrage of criticism, however, Bray expressed little concern about threats of lost federal funding or retribution from national party figures.
After the vote, Bray told reporters he had “lots of conversations with folks in Washington, D.C.” and maintained that “Indiana will continue to function.”

Since September, American employers have been required to pay a $100,000 sponsorship fee for new H-1B visas, one of several policy shifts under President Donald Trump to restrict who gets to come in and out of the country. But while much attention has been paid to what this means for applicants in California’s tech industry, the rule affects its public school system as well.
As Sophie Sullivan and Alina Ta of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network explain, K-12 schools employ skilled foreign educators, particularly to staff language and special education programs. In 2023, West Contra Costa Unified School District hired about 88 teachers on H-1B visas, most of whom came from the Philippines, Spain and Mexico. Even then, hiring those teachers required paying application fees ranging from $9,500 to $18,800. 

Sylvia Greenwood, the district’s assistant superintendent for human resources: “With our shortages in special ed, they were a good fit for our district. … We kept that pipeline open and brought teachers here from the Philippines to support our students and our students with special needs.”

With the cost of hiring those teachers now exceeding $100,000 following Trump’s new policy, it’s likely those positions will be left empty. Without international employees to fulfill hiring gaps, the workload for other teachers will also increase, said one Ford Elementary School teacher in the district. 
H.R. is a physical education teacher in West Contra Costa who works on a short-term J-1 visa. He and his family moved from Mexico to the U.S. three years ago, but he now expects to move back after his visa expires in June 2026 because the district is unlikely to pay for his immigration fees.

H.R.: “Everybody says here that they need teachers in California … but they don’t want to do anything to (help us stay) here.”

PG&E secures another permit for nuclear plant

On Thursday the California Coastal Commission approved Pacific Gas & Electric’s permit to keep operating the state’s last nuclear power plant, but only under key conditions, reports CalMatters’ Nadia Lathan.
Located along the San Luis Obispo shoreline, Diablo Canyon provides about 8% of California’s total energy. Originally due to close this year, the plant remains open through 2030 following a state law passed in 2022 to keep Diablo Canyon operating. Because the plant operates within the coastal commission’s jurisdiction, however, PG&E still needed its separate approval.
The commission gave that approval on the contingency that PG&E also conserves about 4,000 acres of land on its property that would not be developed for any commercial or residential use.
The vote renewed debates about keeping the plant open. The plant draws in 2 million gallons of water from the ocean daily to cool its systems. In addition to the harm this brings to marine wildlife, environmentalists have also raised concerns about radioactive waste.
Proponents say the plant provides reliable, clean energy and keeps thousands of people employed. PG&E now awaits federal approval for a 20-year relicensing permit through 2045.

The price of CA water

A new report finds that California cities pay more for water than what irrigation districts pay to supply water to farms, write CalMatters’ Rachel Becker and Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett.
Cities pay on average about $722 per acre foot for water, compared to just $35 agricultural districts pay, according to researchers at UCLA and advocates with the Natural Resources Defense Council. One acre foot can supply roughly 11 Californians with water for a year.
The difference in water prices depends on the source: Water supplied from federally managed rivers and reservoirs costs far less on average than water from state-managed distribution systems or through water transfers, which drive up prices with each change-of-hands.
Researchers attributed this 20-fold difference to the cost of delivering water to cities and water transfers. The most expensive water in California, for example, flows from Northern California rivers all the way down to the San Gorgonio Pass Water Agency in Riverside County, which costs more than $2,850 per acre foot. Meanwhile, three California agricultural suppliers with rights to the Colorado River receive water for free from the federal government.

“The idea is to have a political and social component in the creation of knowledge at the university,” said Camilo Ruiz, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Connecticut.
On the second floor of the Park Street Public Library, Ruiz’s students presented their final projects in English to community members in Hartford, with simultaneous Spanish translation provided by Constanza Segovia, organizing director and cofounder of Hartford Deportation Defense and Connecticut For All.
The People’s Migrant School is an effort by Ruiz, with the support and collaboration of the Human Rights Institute and the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Connecticut, to bring the classroom to the people. And also to focus the research generated by students in the ‘Latinx communities in the United States’ class, on creating tangible and useful information for neighborhoods in Hartford.

More than 150,000 people in Hartford are considered immigrants, according to the national census. This group is composed primarily of people who migrated from the Caribbean, South America and Central America. Two-thirds of them have resided in the U.S. since 2009 or earlier.
Ruiz said classes traditionally do not extend beyond the four walls of a university classroom, but this year he wanted to do things differently, given the multiple detentions of immigrants around the city.
“Since many of my students have migratory connections to the United States, I proposed to them changing the class format to something relevant that connects the university with the immigrant population,” Ruiz said.
Segovia advised Ruiz to have the students focus their projects on Connecticut and, if possible, on Hartford. This led to the creation of seven different projects with one-page printed infographics in English and Spanish, which were distributed at the event.
Saturday’s presentations covered topics such as the history, recruitment and infrastructure of national immigration agencies, the Trust Act, and a short film that offered a mother’s perspective on immigration raids.
Two presentations were about ‘Know Your Health Rights’, where students outlined strategies to mitigate risks, like having photocopies of medical prescriptions, a list of their medical providers and medical records.
For some students, like Nicole Samaniego, the project was more than just a class assignment.
“I don’t have the luxury of separating this project from my personal life. My family is immigrant, and this information we presented is so important to me,” said Samaniego.
Student Beatriz Torres explained that this project is an attempt to connect with communities and what happens in their daily lives outside of the university campus.
“If you walk around the university campus, people act like nothing is happening, and that’s a privilege,” Torres said.

After the presentations, there was a time for dialogue and reflection with the audience, which included Hartford residents, professors and community activists from the immigrant community, such as Ruth Valera, a member of the Hartford Deportation Defense.
Valera asked the audience if those who had gone to the Capitol to support them when they testified in favor of HUSKY for Immigrants, the Trust Act or for more protections for immigrants could raise their hands. Less than 10 people in a room of more than 40 did.
“It wasn’t easy speaking in English to politicians in suits, who are mostly white, right?” said Valera, looking at the people who had testified with her at the legislature. “It’s not easy to be heard; it’s intimidating sometimes, but we’re going to keep doing it, and we need you to join us.”

La Universidad de Connecticut, junto con el Colectivo de Defensa de Hartford, inauguró el sábado en Hartford la primera sesión de la nueva “Escuela Popular”, con el objetivo de crear puentes de colaboración entre la universidad y las comunidades inmigrantes de la ciudad.
“La idea es que haya un componente político y social en la creación de conocimiento en la universidad”, dijo Camilo Ruiz, profesor de antropología en la Universidad de Connecticut.
En el segundo piso de la Biblioteca Pública de Park Street, estudiantes de Ruiz presentaron sus proyectos finales en inglés a miembros de la comunidad de Hartford, con traducción en español al momento por Constanza Segovia, directora del Colectivo de Defensa de Hartford y Connecticut For all. 
La Escuela Popular es un esfuerzo del profesor Ruiz, con ayuda del Instituto de Derechos Humanos y el Centro de Estudios Latinoamericanos de la Universidad de Connecticut, en abrir el salón de clase a la calles. También en que la investigación que alumnos de su clase de Comunidades Latinas en Estados Unidos, genere información palpable y útil para los vecindarios en Hartford.
En Hartford, más de 150,000 personas son consideradas inmigrantes en el censo nacional. Este grupo está formado por gente que migró mayormente del Caribe, Sudamérica y Centroamérica. Dos tercios de ellos residen en EE.UU desde el 2009 o antes. 
Ruiz comenta que las clases tradicionalmente no salen de las cuatro paredes de la universidad, pero que este año quería hacer las cosas diferente al haber múltiples redadas en comunidades migrantes alrededor de la ciudad.
“Dado a que muchos de mis estudiantes tienen conexiones migratorias con los Estados Unidos, les propuse que si estaban dispuestos a cambiar el formato de la clase, algo que sea relevante para vincular la universidad con la población migrante”, explica Ruiz.
Segovia aconsejó a Ruiz, para que los estudiantes orienten sus proyectos en Connecticut y de ser posible, en la capital. Fue así que surgieron siete proyectos diferentes con infográficos impresos de una página en inglés y en español, los cuales repartieron en el evento.
Las presentaciones del sábado cubrían temas sobre la historia, reclutamiento y la infraestructura de las agencias de immigracion nacionales, el Trust Act, y un cortometraje que pone un lente de madre a las redadas. 
Para algunos estudiantes como Nicole Samaniego, el proyecto fue mas que una tarea de clase.
“No tengo el lujo de separar este proyecto con mi vida personal, mi familia es inmigrante y esta información que presentamos es tan importante para mí”, dijo Samaniego.
La estudiante Beatriz Torres explicó que este proyecto es un intento de acercarse a las comunidades y lo que pasa en el día a día fuera del campus universitario. 
“Si caminas por el campus de la universidad, la gente actúa como si no estuviera pasando nada y eso es un privilegio”, sostuvo Torres.
Al terminar las presentaciones se abrió el espacio al diálogo y reflexiones con la audiencia, quienes eran residentes de Hartford, profesores, y activistas de la comunidad migrante como Ruth Valera, miembro del Colectivo de Defensa de Hartford.
Valera pidió que levantaran la mano quienes habían ido al capitolio a acompañarlos cuando testificaron a favor de HUSKY for Immigrants, el Trust Act, y por más protecciones para los inmigrantes. Menos de 10 personas levantaron la mano en un salón de más de 40.
“No fue fácil hablar en inglés con políticos encorbatados, mayormente blancos ¿verdad?”, dijo Valera dirigiendo la mirada hacia las personas que fueron a testificar con ella a la legislatura. “No es fácil ser escuchados; intimida a veces, pero lo vamos a seguir haciendo y necesitamos que nos acompañen”.

Some of it isn't true.","As Gavin Newsom ramps up his almost certain campaign for president, and polls put him in contention for the Democratic Party’s nomination in 2028, he has become a favorite target of right-leaning commentators on network television and in YouTube videos and social media.
While some criticism is grounded in fact and reasonable differences, there’s also a substrata of highly exaggerated, even fictional, output. Talking heads present him not as an ambitious politician who poses as a selfless public servant — something they all do, including the current president — but as a crooked charlatan.
There’s plenty of material in Newsom’s nearly three decades-long political career for legitimate criticism. And he tends toward over-the-top braggadocio about his accomplishments and amnesia about his failures.
However, his most virulent critics take nuggets of fact — including those having nothing to do with Newsom — and pump them up to depict him as an agent of corruption and incompetence.
One much-repeated trope is that Newsom, in concert with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, purposely or incompetently failed to protect residents of the city and suburban neighborhoods from devastating wildfires early this year.
President Donald Trump fed that narrative by accusing Newsom of not sending enough water to Southern California, thus leading to shortages that impeded firefighting. It’s just not true, but it’s repeated, with embellishments, on a regular basis.
Another oft-aired criticism of Newsom misuses a column I wrote when he was inaugurated in 2019. It depicted the fascinating interconnections between his family and the Getty, Brown and Pelosi clans, stretching back more than eight decades.
Videos that frequently pop up on YouTube quote from the column verbatim, without attribution, and show the chart of family connections that accompanied the article. Then they tack on fact-free addendums suggesting connections to organized crime or some other nefarious activities.
Another line of criticism cites some left-wing legislative or ballot measure proposal, treats it like it’s already in law, portrays its supposedly devastating effect on the innocent public and lays it at Newsom’s feet. The proposed wealth tax, which could appear on the 2026 ballot, is one favorite topic, even though Newsom has repeatedly rejected it.
Many of Newsom’s critics who breathlessly report on his evil plans (that the left-wing mainstream media supposedly cover up) are just nobodies who feign authority and are obviously fronting for right-wing organizations. But some are recognizable California figures.
Two frequent YouTube critics are Carl DeMaio, a longtime Republican politician in San Diego who won a seat in the state Assembly last year, and Victor Davis Hanson, an historian connected to Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.

Assemblymember Carl DeMaio speaks during the session at the state Capitol in Sacramento on Jan. 23, 2025. Photo by Fred Greaves for CalMatters.

DeMaio’s shtick is that he has discovered some horrible thing that Newsom and other Democrats have cooked up to damage honest, hard-working Californians, but that mainstream media have ignored. It’s usually accompanied by a pitch for donations to his organization.
Hanson is a widely recognized, erudite authority on military history, particularly World War II. He also fancies himself a political commentator with a particular bead on Newsom, but his critiques are often factually deficient.
One of Hanson’s favorite assertions is that Newsom diverted bond funds meant to construct new water projects into financing the demolition of four dams on the Klamath River. However the commitment for that project dates back to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s governorship, and the bond issue specifically contained the appropriation for it.
Distorted criticism of Newsom is more off-putting than even his own tendency to bend historic fact. It also undercuts legitimate questioning of Newsom’s record, because he can, and does, depict any negative depictions as baseless propaganda.
The anti-Newsom drumbeat is likely to get louder as he moves ever closer to a declaration of presidential candidacy. Viewer beware.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082125_Redistricting-Newsom_MG_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-12 08:58:58.426660

Rigel Robinson
Rigel Robinson is a former Berkeley City Councilmember


At first the plan for the property a block from UC Berkeley was modest: build a two-unit accessory dwelling behind a pair of small apartment buildings.
Since then, Berkeley’s zoning board has approved a dramatically different vision for the site: a 20-story tower with 169 apartments. When complete, it will be the tallest structure in Berkeley’s Southside neighborhood.
The project’s evolution captures how quickly Berkeley’s housing landscape can change, as the city and state embrace pro-housing policies. It also shows how one California community can switch its approach to solving its housing problems. 
For years, Berkeley’s shortage of student housing near campus has caused ripples throughout the broader rental market. Students were pushed to live far from campus, which drove up rents citywide. 
It’s a student housing crisis within a citywide housing crisis.
In 2023 Berkeley adopted a major upzoning plan for the Southside neighborhood, after years of debate over how to relieve the housing shortage. The rezoning campaign, launched when I was a student at UC Berkeley and completed during my tenure on the City Council, allowed taller and denser buildings near campus. 
The final vote was contentious. Some council members proposed last-minute restrictions. But a pro-housing majority advanced the plan.
At the same time, lawmakers in Sacramento were rewriting rules to help cities grow and meet their housing needs. Changes to the state’s density bonus law, including Assembly Bill 1287, signed in 2023, allow developers to exceed local height limits if they include additional affordable units on site.

Together, those reforms transformed what was possible at the Berkeley site, at 2425 Durant Avenue. Yes Duffy Architects included additional affordable homes into the project, triggering the density bonus and unlocking additional height beyond Berkeley’s new zoning limits.
But the journey to project approval has been complicated.
Once plans for the site were in motion, the Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association tried to make the existing property at the site a landmark, a move consistent with its pattern of targeting sites slated for new housing. 
The city council unanimously rejected the landmarking attempt. Now, the project has its permit but an appeal has been filed.
When built, the 20-story structure will undoubtedly make some Berkeley residents uncomfortable. But after decades of restricting growth, the city has little standing to object. 
Berkeley’s political culture has shifted, slowly but decisively, from resistance to responsibility. That shift didn’t come easily. 
For years, progress was stymied by neighborhood opposition and a city council wary of change. But cycle after cycle, pro-housing candidates won elections, reshaping the city’s politics and setting a new course.
And on campus at UC Berkeley, Chancellor Carol Christ championed new student housing, a cause her predecessors had neglected. From Anchor House to People’s Park, the city’s skyline is being remade by new housing for students.
The result is a city that has become one of California’s most surprising housing reform success stories: a community that, after years of hesitation, is building with urgency.
That progress remains fragile. Across the state, local resistance continues to stall housing projects. Perhaps it’s best exemplified by the resistance of Los Angeles’ city leaders to the recently signed Senate Bill 79, which encourages the development of dense housing around public transit locations.
We have much work to do to move public consciousness around solutions to the housing crisis. 
Berkeley’s experience shows that change is possible when local and state reforms align, and when communities are willing to let go of outdated fears about growth. The 169 new homes coming to 2425 Durant are the product of years of advocacy and persistence from residents tired of watching their friends and neighbors priced out.
Progress in city halls and the state Capitol can be slow. But once reform takes hold, transformation can come fast. When the political will exists, even a two-unit idea can grow into a 20-story solution.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/081623_Berkeley-Student-Housing_SN_CM_29.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-12 08:58:58.426660

(Photo courtesy The Conservation Fund)A former mineral processing site in the middle of a treasured desert wetland habitat will soon be cleaned up and restored after a conservation group reached a deal to buy the 18-acre industrial site.
The Conservation Fund – in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service – purchased the longtime industrial processing site within the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge from zeolite manufacturer KMI Zeolite in October for $900,000. 
Under the purchase agreement, KMI Zeolite agreed to remove industrial equipment from the site by October 2026. The Conservation Fund said their ultimate goal is to transfer ownership of the property to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the national refuge. 
The Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1984 to protect the desert oasis’ natural springs, and significant populations of threatened and endangered species found nowhere else in the world. However, several swaths of private land purchased before the refuge was established are scattered throughout the area.
The property purchased by the fund has been in private ownership since 1914. Remnants of a former dude ranch that catered to divorce seekers, a motel, and a bar built on the site before it became an industrial site are still present. 
While the site is not the largest parcel of private property located in the refuge – that honor goes to a 40-acre Christian camp dubbed “Patch of Heaven” – it is a significant site due to the presence of a spring that supports a large swath of riparian habitat.
It’s also one of the few sites in the refuge still being used for industrial purposes. 
“It’s highly visible because it’s right on the entrance road coming in from the south, so you have to drive right past it. Everybody sees it and they wonder what those big buildings are,” said John Hiatt, one of the founding board members of the Amargosa Conservancy.
The Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge and surrounding area has a large concentration of zeolite, a clay-like mineral used in water filtration, odor control, and soil conditioner. The area has recently attracted applications for new zeolite exploration projects, which received strong pushback from locals and conservation groups. 
“They basically had trucks hauling it in, trucks hauling it out, and whatnot, which really is not a use that’s necessarily compatible with a wildlife refuge and they had no interest in maintaining the riparian portion of the property,” Hiatt said of the former zeolite processing site.
KMI Zeolite confirmed they sold their former Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge parcel but declined to make an official statement. The company recently relocated its main refinement center to Pahrump, in order to build newer facilities and be closer to a population center.

Gavin Kakol, the Nevada field representative for the Conservation Fund, said when he first visited the site in January there were remnants of materials and debris. 
Kakol said the site is significant because of its proximity to habitat with known populations of the endangered Ash Meadows speckled dace and Ash Meadows pupfish pupfish. 
“We’re dealing with a wetland system here. After large rains this whole area becomes interconnected, and there’s the potential for these fish to flow even onto the property itself, and for water to move in between the refuge itself and the private property,” Kakol said.
Kakol said there are several other endangered groundwater dependent plants with known populations within a quarter mile of the former industrial site, including Ash Meadows Gumplant, Tecopa Birdbeak, and the Spring loving century.
“We are actively working with the Nevada Heritage Foundation to do habitat surveying this spring and upcoming summer. We hope to get a good handle on the other potential endangered species that are actually on site or in close proximity to it,” Kakol said.
The Conservation Fund’s purchase of the KMI Zeolite processing site is “a victory for conservation,” said Haitt.
“Now we have an opportunity to restore the riparian habitat in that area for which the entire refuge was created. Ash Meadows is just this unique place. It’s the largest oasis in the Mojave Desert, and this is just one of the springs that constituted that oasis,” Hiatt said.
The Conservation Fund has conserved over 1.2 million acres of habitat in the State of Nevada. The fund also worked with the Fish and Wildlife Service on several other acquisitions, including a 120-acre Ruby Lake Refuge acquisition in 2022 and a 433-acre Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge acquisition in 2020.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8816-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 08:58:58.426660

The commission approved three dispensary licenses at its meeting on Thursday. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission Thursday approved three dispensary licenses, which members of the commission hailed as a critical step toward making medical cannabis available in Alabama nearly five years after the Legislature established the program. 
“We waited a long time to get to this point in time where we can make a decision like this, and it is monumental,” Rex Vaughn, chair of the commission, said. “It’s a milestone meeting for us, so I’m tickled we can get this far.”
GP6 Wellness, RJK Holdings and CCS of Alabama will receive dispensary licenses within 28 days, as long as the companies pay the $40,000 licensing fee. A fourth license will be approved by the commission in late January due to a recommendation from an administrative law judge, Vaughn said after the meeting. 
Vaughn said multiple times during the meeting that the approval of dispensary licenses is a milestone and will lead to patients getting care they need and tax revenue for the state. 
“It takes a while for that to come through the system, but we should be seeing revenue by springtime at the latest,” Vaughn said.
The Alabama medical cannabis law, enacted in 2021, allows registered physicians to recommend cannabis for about 15 medical conditions, including cancer, depression, Parkinson’s Disease, PTSD, sickle-cell anemia, chronic pain, and terminal diseases. The approved product forms are restricted to tablets, tinctures, patches, oils, and gummies (only peach flavor), with raw plant material and smokable forms remaining prohibited.
People who suffer from the qualifying conditions must get approval from their physician and enter the patient registry in order to buy products at a dispensary.
Litigation has also held up access to medical cannabis. Some firms sued the commission for not being awarded a license, citing a discriminatory process. Another case involved five parents that sued the commission over delays in access to cannabis, which was dismissed in August.
As of Thursday, the commission had distributed licenses for nine cultivators, four processors, four transporters, and three dispensaries. There is also one patient in the registry, Vaughn said. 
Vaughn was not able to give a specific timeline for when the product will be available for purchase, but estimated Spring 2026. Earlier this year, AMCC Executive Director John McMillan had expressed hopes of getting medical cannabis in patients’ hands by the end of 2025. 
“We’ve gotta get our physicians certified quickly. All those things are being staged as we talk right now, and we’ll see how the wintertime goes,” Vaughn said. “Hopefully all these things will fall in place quite quickly.”
Sam Blakemore, a pharmacist and member of the commission, said in an interview after the meeting that medical cannabis can help relieve symptoms without side effects like nausea and vomiting.
“Everybody focuses on Delta-9, but there are over 120 chemicals in the plant that’s able to give this full body experience of allowing patients to really get relief when it comes to nausea and vomiting, spasticity,” Blakemore said.
Blakemore primarily prescribes drugs for pediatric oncology patients. He brought his wife and two young children to the meeting to celebrate the approval of licenses.
“I’m not going to say cannabis is a cure all, but the big thing with getting this done today is at least the folks, that I call the sick and shut in, in the state, they can get relief,” Blakemore said. “They can’t get relief from opioids. They can’t get relief from the gabapentin. They can finally have an opportunity to try something.”
Supporters of medical cannabis attended the meeting Thursday. 
Amanda Taylor, a medical cannabis patient advocate, has been a part of the commission’s process since 2021. She suffers from multiple lesions on her brain and spine.

(Photo: Thianchai Sitthikongsak/Getty Images)If your family is anything like mine, you dread opening up your NV Energy bill every month. Over the summer and fall, I thought I was seeing double; my bill was so high. All across the country, rate payers are facing eye-popping increases.
What is to blame for the sudden increase in costs? Recently, big tech’s AI-fueled data center frenzy has been driving up utility costs nationwide. And it’s about to get even worse.
According to a MIT study, a single data center can use as much energy as an entire city, and frighteningly, big tech could transform the Reno area into the largest data center market in the world if we don’t take action. Greedy businesses are making opportunistic moves on data center expansion, and Nevada is where they come for cheap land, cheap energy, and tax breaks. As a result, multi-billion-dollar tech companies whose massive data centers power AI growth are consistently proposing new data centers. These giant warehouse-like structures house hundreds of computer servers and other IT infrastructure to store, process, and manage data. That number of computers and servers requires enormous amounts of energy and also generates a lot of heat. To keep the computers cool, data centers use large amounts of water and place a massive burden on the energy grid, which drives up energy costs for everyone else to line the pockets of big tech’s AI companies.
For example, take Switch, a multi-billion dollar corporation that built one of the largest data centers in the world—named “the Citadel,” in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. Switch’s clients include some of the wealthiest corporations in the country. On its website, Switch names as its clients PayPal and Thiel Wealth, companies owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of Palantir, an organization providing the U.S. government with unprecedented surveillance capabilities, which could threaten the rights of us all. 
Despite being valued at billions of dollars, data center companies like Switch are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in public subsidies from our state. Annually, Nevada spends $139 million in public subsidies for data centers. That means that taxpayers like us foot the bill twice: first, we give data center companies a massive tax break to build in Nevada. Then, we pay for the energy upgrades and ongoing energy use they require through our increased utility bills.
Since data centers have sprouted up in Nevada, NV Energy has predicted a 53% increase in greenhouse emissions, which amounts to 3.2 million tons of additional greenhouse gas pollution. Data centers use billions of gallons of our scarce water, which should be prioritized for people, not big business. Moreover, they would necessitate expanding the state’s power sector by approximately 40%, when we already experience blackouts regularly threatening the lives of Nevadans across the state.
The public is paying for tech companies’ dirty energy expansion with little to no benefits to show for it. Data centers employ very few people full-time, and with no real investment in our communities and an increasing concern of an AI bubble burst, this irresponsible growth of data centers at the expense of working families should concern us all. We need a state that meets the needs of everyday Nevadans, not big tech billionaires.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/transmission-lines-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 08:58:58.426660

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)The Veterans Mental Health Steering Committee announced grants Thursday for five organizations to provide mental health services for veterans.
The organizations will provide a host of services focused on the mental health needs of veterans, from substance abuse and treatment referrals to outpatient services, as well as telehealth, in-person therapy  and treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder.
“They are filling a gap,” said Kimberly Boswell, commissioner of the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs and chair of the steering committee, in an interview following the meeting. “A lot of individuals do not necessarily want to come to a mental health center, do not necessarily want to go to the federal Veteran’s Administration programs, and so they are really filling in a gap between those services where they can go to an independent, private provider to get services.”

The recipients include Altapointe, an organization based in Mobile that provides crisis care and referrals for treatment, as well as education and preventative services.
Another group, The Shoulder, will offer residential substance abuse treatment services to veterans along with preventative outreach. The Shoulder focuses on treating veterans with drug addictions living in rural areas, along with veterans who have become involved with the criminal justice system.
Alabama’s veterans experienced suicide at a rate of 35.4 per 100,000 in 2021, exceeding both the national veteran average and the state’s general population rate. A significant number of Alabamians, including veterans, suffer from traumatic brain injuries (TBI), a condition linked to increased mental health challenges. Research indicates veterans in Alabama face higher rates of mental illness and substance abuse compared to their non-veteran counterparts.
A committee with veterans with behavioral health services or administration evaluated the applications for the grants, funded by money from the national opioid settlement.
Boswell said the Legislature allocated $3 million for the pilot programs, part of a comprehensive plan aimed at mental health treatment for veterans.
The five organizations will provide the Alabama Veterans Resource Center — established under SB 70, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Jones, R-Centre and passed by the Legislature last spring — with additional organizations where they can refer veterans who need services.
According to the bill, the center will provide “comprehensive support services” for veterans and their families, from career counseling and job placement services to education and career training opportunities.
“The whole idea of the veterans resource center is to help our veterans make that transition from military service to civilian service,” said Jeffrey Newton, commissioner of the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs, in an interview following the meeting. “When they walk into this veterans resource center, it is going to be a one-stop shop, so whatever they need to help them with the transition, including their family members, we are there to help them.”

Mike Braun lead an Indiana Economic Development Corp. meeting on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Indiana Economic Development Corp.)Hoosier economic development leaders on Thursday celebrated updated job creation data and outlined a push for regional strategic plans.
As of Dec. 1, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. has secured company commitments to add 10,600 new jobs, leaders said.
Those roles are expected to pay an average of $40.59 hourly, up from last year’s $36.09. Incentive spending per job, meanwhile, dropped to $15,485 from the $46,850 expended last year, according to the IEDC.
“Our strategic focus on increasing wages and jobs in Indiana is working,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a news release. “By supporting Indiana companies and the Main Street economy, we’re helping businesses to grow, encouraging more high-wage career opportunities, and creating the next generation of entrepreneurs. All in all, these results will deliver a more robust economy.”
Braun leads the quasi-public agency’s board of directors, which convened Thursday afternoon for its first meeting since releasing the results of a forensic analysis into the activities of IEDC and several partners.
It was also new Chief Administration Officer Alison Grand’s first meeting. She’ll have general counsel duties and serve as one of IEDC’s two ethics officers.
IEDC audit results sent to inspector general; Dems call for accountability 

Her role is among changes prompted by the findings, which included lackluster oversight and questionable spending.
IEDC’s nonprofit arm, which previously funneled largely anonymous donations into economic development travel, hasn’t accepted contributions in months. The $1.9 million left in the account will be used to support the agency’s initiatives, said David Fagan, the board’s audit and finance committee chair.
The board has also revamped its conflict of interest policies — with screened members exiting the room for certain projects — and investment policies. Only the full board makes binding votes now, with committees offering recommendations.
“The foundation is firmly in place; 2026 is all going to be about execution,” Commerce Secretary and CEO David Adams said.
That includes a renewed focus on regional economic development.
IEDC has contracted McKinsey & Company to create the guidelines for regional strategic plans. That’s expected to be done this year, Adams said.
The 15 regions will create and submit their plans in the first quarter of next year, and then execute them with state support, according to a slide deck for the meeting.
The agenda also included the approval of changes to investment policies and loans with the Indiana Angel Network Fund. It’s part of Elevate Ventures, one of the “entities of interest” examined in the forensic analysis.
One loan amendment lets IEDC convert the remaining outstanding balance into ownership of the Indiana Angel Network Fund since the loan’s maturity date has passed. The board also approved a new, $5 million loan for the group.
New IEDC President Josh Richardson also made his board meeting debut.
Braun appointed him to the position in October, after lawmakers decreed the IEDC’s president and CEO roles should be held by two separate people.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The U.S. Senate sent President Donald Trump a bill Thursday that would protect a portion of the Wounded Knee Massacre site on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, sponsored the legislation in the House, where it passed in January. Sen. Mike Rounds sponsored the legislation in the Senate, where it passed Thursday, with Majority Leader John Thune as a cosponsor. Both are Republicans from South Dakota.
Johnson released a statement saying “the time is now here to properly memorialize the lost and preserve the land.”
“I look forward to seeing the president sign this into law to ensure the land remains sacred for generations to come,” Johnson said.
Rounds also issued a statement, saying the Wounded Knee Massacre was “a devastating low point in U.S.-Lakota relations” and “we will continue to tell the story of this dark day in our nation’s history.”
Focus on individual conduct instead of massacre doomed Wounded Knee medals review, panelist says

The legislation would place 40 acres at the massacre site in restricted-fee status, which means it could not be sold, taxed, gifted or leased without approval by Congress and the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, which jointly purchased the land three years ago.
The leaders of both tribes praised the bill’s passage in comments included in a news release from Johnson.
“Today, we stand to acknowledge the atrocities committed against the Lakota people to continue to heal, to protect, to educate, and most importantly, to ensure that we never forget the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890,” said Cheyenne River Tribe Chairman Ryman LeBeau.
Oglala Sioux Tribe President Frank Star Comes Out called the bill “an important act that will preserve the memory of the Wounded Knee Massacre and the legacy and sacrifice of our ancestors.”
“Significantly,” Star Comes Out said, “it also promotes tribal self-determination and allows us to protect our Wounded Knee site in perpetuity.”
The bill’s passage comes a little more than two months after U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced his rejection of calls to rescind medals awarded to soldiers for their participation in the massacre.
Bills to revoke the medals have been introduced this congressional session in the House from Jill Tokuda, D-Hawaii, and in the Senate from Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts. Neither bill has advanced out of its assigned committee, and South Dakota’s members of Congress have not signed on as cosponsors.
The massacre occurred on Dec. 29, 1890. A large group of Lakota people traveling to the Pine Ridge Agency in southwestern South Dakota made camp near Wounded Knee Creek, where they were surrounded by hundreds of Army soldiers. A shot rang out during a struggle while the soldiers tried to disarm the camp, and the soldiers opened fire.
Fewer than 40 soldiers were killed (some by friendly fire, according to historians), while estimates of Lakota deaths ran from 200 to 300 or more, depending on the source, including men, women and children. After some of the bodies froze on the ground for several days, a military-led burial party placed them in a mass grave.
One hundred years later in 1990, Congress passed a resolution expressing “deep regret” for the massacre.

Michigan is the only state with a currently circulating statewide Ranked Choice Voting ballot petition, according to Rank MI Vote, the grassroots organization, which wrote in a press release that the Heritage Foundation will make Michigan “ground zero in a national battle over whether voters or political insiders will shape the rules of our elections.”
The foundation included the issue of ranked choice voting in its policy section on election integrity, initially released in March in a report titled “Restoring America’s Promise”.
“Heritage will restore faith in elections and protect the right to vote for all Americans by advocating for commonsense reforms at the state and federal level like requiring proof of U.S. citizenship to vote and ending the practice of ranked-choice voting,” the organization’s website reads. “We will always oppose a federal takeover of our elections by Washington elites.”
But Joe Spaulding, Rank MI Vote’s Campaign Director, sees ranked choice voting as exactly the opposite of takeover by elites: he sees it as increasing the options for voters at the ballot box. 
“Out-of-state special interests oppose Ranked Choice Voting for a very simple reason: it means elections deliver representative, majority-supported outcomes where voters can easily reject their extreme policy agendas,” Spaulding said in the press release.

In an interview with Michigan Advance, he also pushed back against an argument that a new style of voting would confuse voters and lower voter turnout.
“Voters are not overwhelmed or confused by having too many choices when they vote. Their arms aren’t getting tired when they’re filling out ballots,” he said. “They feel underwhelmed by having a lack of choice, and they are upset by a hostile and very negative politics that drives perpetual decreases in voter turnout, cycle after cycle.”
That was one of the most pressing concerns of the Michigan Association of County Clerks, who published a resolution in October to oppose the ballot initiative. 
Spaulding says he is very focused on addressing those concerns, as they come from election administrators who will be impacted by the policy if it goes into effect. 
But when it comes to bad-faith attacks on ranked choice voting, like those coming out of the Heritage Foundation, he said, “it would be a disservice towards the folks that have legitimate concerns about improving democracy to be treating what they’re saying seriously.”
In order to both address those concerns and reach voters to sign the petition to get the initiative on the 2026 ballot, which Spaulding said is in the “window of viability,” Rank MI Vote has been hosting its “Bridge the Divide tour” — a run of 60 town halls scheduled across the state in 40 days, though some of those were cancelled or rescheduled due to weather. 
“Folks are super interested in not being punished as voters for having more choices. The math behind that is super simple,” Spaulding said. “When you tell a room full of folks that voters are punished for getting more choices — and the way that looks is, if a third person runs for a race, the winner only needs 34%, if a fourth person runs, it’s only 26% — they all nod.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20250405-Holland-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 07:56:22.904809

(Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)A true ban on cellphones at school is working its way through the Legislature and I can’t think of something that could more directly — and quickly — make a difference in student behavior and performance.
It should have been done years ago, but only recently has it gained momentum.
I remember my daughter texting me during school and getting her phone taken away for not paying attention. That burden on teachers has turned into an everyday chore that eclipsed their teaching duties.
I managed to get through school just fine without one. Of course, younger folks will label me a grumpy boomer (I’m not that old), but phones are not necessary in school. Parents and students can arrange pickup or after school plans the night before or in the morning. If an emergency occurs, parents can call the office to get a message to their children.
In 2024, the General Assembly started down the path of restricting cellphones but only during instructional time. That meant kids were still carrying them around, checking them between classes and texting each other covertly.
Testimony at the Statehouse this week included that some students even physically assaulted teachers who tried to take the phones away.
So, the Senate Education Committee is considering a “bell to bell” ban. The Indiana House has a similar bill filed as well.
The details
Under Senate Bill 78, school corporations and charter schools would be required to adopt a wireless communication device ban that prohibits students from using or possessing a wireless communication device during the school day and requires that any teacher-directed use of a device “for educational purposes” occur only on school-supplied devices.
It also mandates that each district choose between two enforcement models: a “no device policy,” in which students may not bring phones to school at all; or a “secure storage policy,” in which students may bring phones but must store them so they are “inaccessible throughout the school day” and returned only after dismissal.
Some schools are already doing this. For instance, Fort Wayne Community Schools requires students to place their phones in secure pouches upon arrival and keep them locked until dismissal to reduce distractions and improve focus.
Other schools have similar programs.

Testimony this week indicated lunchrooms and hallways are noisier — in a good way — and bullying is down.
And we are starting to see more than anecdotal evidence. Studies are finding schools with cellphone bans have seen test score boosts, fewer fights and better attendance.
The issue does become more problematic when schools give students their own laptops for schoolwork. I know from experience that students will find a way to use that device to chat with their friends or watch videos. And schools spend a fair amount of time trying to block websites and ensure the computers are actually used for academic work.
The one area that gives some people pause about such bans is the reality of school shootings. It has become an unfortunate part of society that students have had to call 911 for help during the chaos of a student shooting. Or they send parents texts and updates.
The bill being discussed has exemptions for emergency circumstances as well as for students with ongoing medical conditions. For instance, a student might need their phone to use a glucose monitor for diabetes.
I look forward to seeing how the bill moves forward. I think there is a way to ban devices and force students to focus on their education instead of the latest TikTok trend.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has called such bans unconstitutional. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)A controversial bill that would largely ban immigration agents from covering their faces on the job advanced Thursday after nearly an hour of tense debate.
The bill, which passed along party lines, would require all law enforcement officers in the state, including federal agents, to keep their faces uncovered while performing official duties in public. Officers would be exempt during undercover assignments, while wearing protective equipment that doesn’t intend to conceal their identities, or if supervisors say “stealth is necessary.”
The legislation comes amid a rise in episodes of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and other federal agents concealing their identities during immigration raids. U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials defend agents masking by saying they and their families are targeted if their identities are known. 
Ewing resident Georganne D’Angelo responds to ICE raids as part of Resistencia en Acción, a group focused on immigrant workers. D’Angelo told the Assembly’s public safety committee Thursday that she has witnessed masked men who refuse to identify themselves “dragging” people off the streets, and fears that they could be impostors.
New Jersey residents deserve to know what agencies are enforcing federal laws, she said. 
In one of several testy exchanges, Assemblyman Erik Peterson (R-Hunterdon) asked D’Angelo why she’d need to know who the masked agents are. 
“Because I am witnessing what is happening, and in order to witness effectively, I need to know who is doing this. I walk right up to these people, and I say, ‘Can you please identify yourself?’ And they’ll say, ‘No,’” she said. 
“Do you do this with the police in Ewing?” Peterson asked. 
“If someone is in a police uniform and gets out of a police car, I have a feeling they’re police,” D’Angelo responded. 
Madison Linton is a policy and research analyst at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, the state’s largest coalition of immigrant organizations. Linton said immigrant communities across the state have faced an unprecedented escalation of enforcement tactics, both large-scale raids at warehouses and individual arrests. 
“Concealing the identity of officers contributes to the widespread fear and confusion that ICE perpetuates and furthers their agency’s culture of rogue lawlessness and immunity from justice,” she said. 
Many activists who testified Thursday afternoon said the legislation doesn’t go far enough. It does little to discourage bad actors from impersonating local, state, or federal officers, they said, and several urged the committee to advance the Immigrant Trust Act, which would codify a state directive limiting local police cooperation with federal immigration agents. 
Assemblyman Paul Kanitra (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Assemblyman Paul Kanitra (R-Ocean) called the bill “blatantly unconstitutional,” adding that the measure’s supporters should not back it either because all of the exemptions in it make it “completely feckless.”
“All this bill does is pander to you. It accomplishes absolutely nothing,” he said.
While the legislation faces more hurdles before making it to the governor’s desk — a Senate companion has not yet been heard and the current legislative session wraps up in four weeks — Homeland Security officials have already said they won’t cooperate.  When Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill said she supports a ban on masked immigration agents, a Homeland Security spokeswoman called such a ban “unconstitutional” and said the agency will not abide by it.
At least one legal expert has agreed that the bill, if signed into law, would likely violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which bars the state from regulating the actions of the federal government.
Similar legislation has been signed into law in California, which goes into effect Jan. 1. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state over the law.
The committee approved the bill Thursday 5-3, with all Democrats on the panel who were present voting yes and all Republicans voting no. Assemblywoman Mitchelle Drulis (D-Hunterdon) acknowledged the constitutional concerns before voting yes. 
“I also think we need to send a message that we are not OK with what is happening in our neighborhoods, in our streets, and to our fellow community members,” she said.

When the infection was discovered during delivery, Cunningham was able to treat the newborn and prevent the infection from spreading.
“ It broke my heart because she was afraid to seek care out of fear of what could happen to her and her baby,” Cunningham said, recalling the woman’s worry that the state might take her child if she admitted to a history of substance use. 
Cunningham, who now serves as director of the St. Louis County Department of Public Health and oversees its perinatal Hepatitis B prevention program, said this case is an example of how a patient with Hepatitis B might fall through the cracks and accidentally spread the illness to her baby. 
Hepatitis B is a viral infection that primarily attacks the liver. Those infected with chronic Hepatitis B can suffer a lifetime of negative health conditions, including cancer.

Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’ Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice announced it no longer recommends infants receive the first of three doses of a Hepatitis B vaccine at birth. 
Instead, for mothers who did not test positive for Hepatitis B in pregnancy, the CDC recommends parents wait until their child is at least 2 months old to administer the first of three doses of a vaccine that protects against Hepatitis B, if it’s given at all.
“Hearing this news that they want to undo what has been a well-researched practice … that can really set families back,” Cunningham said. “I’m really concerned about the impact on the most vulnerable, our babies, contracting it.”
While most infants with Hepatitis B were infected during delivery, Cunninghamn is among scores of medical experts warning this new guidance overlooks the risk for infection that exists outside the delivery room. 
“The thing is, you don’t know who has Hepatitis B,” said Dr. Rachel Orscheln, a professor of pediatrics in the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “Many people are asymptomatic, and so why delay protection when the protection is safe to be administered at an early age?”
Several Missouri health care providers who spoke with The Independent, including pediatricians and obstetricians, strongly urged families to consider the risks of waiting or skipping the vaccine. All continued to align with the American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommendation that infants be vaccinated at birth.
The academy’s president, Susan Kressly, called the new CDC guidance “irresponsible and purposely misleading,” warning that it will lead to more infections. 
Missouri statute requires testing for Hepatitis B, C and syphilis at the first prenatal appointment, typically in the first trimester. But it’s possible for a person to become infected at any point in pregnancy. And not everyone makes it to prenatal appointments.
About 25% of pregnant people in Missouri don’t get prenatal care until after the first trimester, according to the March of Dimes. 
It’s in part why a handful of lawmakers have been pushing for the introduction of a second Hepatitis B test at 28 weeks of pregnancy. Despite bipartisan support the past two years, the legislation never made it to a final vote. 
‘Light bulb moment’: New approach to treating Hep C postpartum a success in St. Louis

Orscheln also fears that without universal newborn vaccinations, more babies will get sick.
She knows pediatricians who are increasingly hearing from parents hesitant to follow the recommended childhood vaccine schedule.
“It has not been helped by the fact that there’s been new changes to the vaccine schedule that are not supported by any data,” Orscheln said. “Our vaccine programs have been so successful that people now are more fearful of vaccines than they are for those infectious diseases … These infectious diseases still exist, and they’re ready to come back.”
Orscheln noted that while every vaccine has potential side effects including soreness at the injection site and a mild fever, serious side effects from vaccinations are “exceedingly rare.”
Dr. Bret Gordon, the OB-GYN division chair at Saint Luke’s in Kansas City, said while parents have always had the right to refuse vaccinations at the hospital, he predicts more parents will opt out of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccine as a result of the new CDC guidance. 
“When patients come in with these questions, when they read things and they see things in the news, we do our best to objectively explain the data and give them good advice based on scientific data,” said Gordon, who added that clinicians increasingly have to counter opinions patients see on social media.
Since the infant Hepatitis B vaccine recommendation was announced in 1991, there has been a 99% decrease in the number of children and teens with the infection.
Martha Smith, Missouri maternal child health director with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said many people aren’t aware of the lifelong health implications of chronic Hepatitis B, the most common type of Hepatitis B to occur in babies and children if the infection isn’t discovered in time.
Not only is the liver at risk. The kidneys can also be harmed. The risk of stomach and pancreatic cancer increases, she said. Those with Hepatitis B double their chances of developing lymphoma. 
“It doesn’t take much more than a microscopic amount (of body fluid) for the virus to spread,” Smith said, noting that younger infants who tend to put everything in their mouths are particularly vulnerable.
Prior to routine vaccination, about half of children who became infected with Hepatitis B got it from a source other than their mother. This was often a different caregiver, like an extended family member or a daycare provider. 
“When you think that hepatitis B can be a silent, asymptomatic condition for somebody, but then they pass it to your baby who doesn’t have all the immunity built up, then they test positive for it, and now they have some significant health implications, because somebody kissed your baby. It kind of puts that age-old tradition of kissing the baby on the head in perspective, doesn’t it?”
Smith encouraged parents to consider all possible risks, and to ask their trusted health care providers about how best to manage those risks.
Dr. Edward Lyons, a pediatric board certified infectious diseases physician at Children’s Mercy in Kansas City, also encouraged parents to bring any worries or confusion to their trusted health care providers.
“I don’t know what misinformation or disinformation people have seen if they don’t tell me,” he said.
And he said while parents can’t protect their children against everything, vaccines are a known safeguard against some of the potential harm in the world.
“The goal of everybody is the same, right?” Lyons said. “Parents and families and clinicians all want these children to be healthy, to be happy, to live long, fulfilling lives.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1210311035-scaled-1-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-12-12 06:57:36.004710

“It kind of now feels like the same as where I'm coming from,” said Juvenari Kambale, a refugee from the Congo. “There's that fear for what's gonna happen next.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
When Juvenari Kambale arrived in Vermont last December, he felt huge relief — his family was safe, and his children could attend school. He arrived through the now-suspended U.S. Refugee Admissions Program from his home country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, via a refugee camp in Uganda.
Kambale, 25, lives in Burlington with his wife and three children, aged 5, 3 and 1 month. He works “as (many) hours as possible” at the shipping department of a local business. 
“I like Burlington so much,” Kambale said. “I like the schools … I’m able to find work.”
But in October, his family abruptly stopped receiving the food assistance they rely on.
Kambale’s is one of over 140 noncitizen households legally residing in Vermont who have experienced a loss of or decrease in nutrition benefits due to visa status, following changes implemented after the congressional passage of July’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Many are humanitarian entrants, meaning they relocated to the United States having fled serious threats to their safety at home.
The 3SquaresVT program — Vermont’s version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — has tightened restrictions in a number of areas this year, including expanded work requirements and cuts to the widely used “heat and eat” utility allowance program. For noncitizens, the cuts have been sweeping, eliminating many — including those with green cards — from the program entirely. 
New guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture required Vermont to amend its rules for the program this week. A spokesperson for the Department for Children and Families confirmed Thursday that refugees and asylees with green cards, in addition to Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders, are once again eligible for 3SquaresVT, contrary to the state’s previous position.

Roughly 90 people total will begin receiving benefits again starting as early as next week, including retroactive payments that were withheld in recent months, the spokesperson said.
Refugees like Kambale, who do not yet have green cards, will remain ineligible regardless. His kids — except the youngest, a U.S. citizen — have been removed from the program along with him and his wife. 
Kambale said he is applying for a green card now, which under the latest guidance would eventually return food benefits to his household. It’s a protracted process, but one in which he would ordinarily have a high probability of success given his status as a refugee. However, in late November, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services memo halted all such applications for refugees who arrived under former President Joe Biden, Reuters reported.
When Kambale was given the opportunity to relocate to the U.S. last year, he accepted it gratefully.
“Congo is not stable,” Kambale said in an interview translated from Kinyarwanda — a central African language — by Ernestine Tuyishime, a case worker at the Vermont office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. “I was forced to flee,” he said.
Prior to acceptance, refugees must demonstrate to U.S. immigration officials that they are escaping persecution, a legal term with a high burden of proof. 
A United Nations report last year said recent escalations in armed conflict between militias and other actors in the Congo and Rwanda had “worsened the already dire humanitarian crisis” in the region, with violence often carried out against civilians directly.
Last week, the Trump administration announced that Congo was one of 19 countries that will see all U.S. visa applications paused. 
Though providing for his family had never been easy for Kambale, who is the sole earner in his household, he had been making it work financially prior to October.
“But now things have changed, with the SNAP cards — we’re not able to get the food that my family would like to have,” he said. “It’s really hard.”
Kambale’s work fluctuates seasonally, he said, and the hours are somewhat unpredictable. He’s looked for other jobs before, but most pay less than he currently earns, or don’t allow for overtime. Learning English, a vital skill for many workplaces, is a “luxury” that Kambale said he doesn’t have right now. He’s often skipped attending language classes, which are often provided to clients by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, or USCRI, in order to work more hours while he can.
“During the wintertime, I may not be working as much,” he said. “So things are gonna get worse for me and my family.”
The safety Kambale thought he had gained just months ago no longer feels assured, he said, and he feels some of the old pressures returning.
“It kind of now feels like the same as where I’m coming from,” he said. “There’s that fear for what’s gonna happen next.”
‘Next month we don’t have anything’
When Hafiza, 53, and her young adult daughter arrived in Vermont earlier this year from Afghanistan, they left everything behind. 
Hafiza’s husband, who worked in the U.S. embassy in Kabul during the war, had applied for a Special Immigrant Visa, a program created to allow safe passage for Afghans and Iraqis who have risked persecution to assist the U.S. military. But by the time the visa was approved, Hafiza’s husband had passed away from Covid-19 at the height of the pandemic, and six of their seven children had aged out of the program’s family protection provisions.

VTDigger is withholding Hafiza’s last name, and her daughter’s name, at their request for the safety of their family.
After four long months in Islamabad, Pakistan — consular processing in Kabul collapsed after the Taliban seized power in 2021 — Hafiza and her daughter arrived in Vermont alone. They had to move several times to find a home that could accommodate Hafiza, who is now ill herself, and cannot climb stairs, her daughter said. 
In October, the two women were cut off from SNAP benefits, which was initially difficult for them to understand, they said. Sonali Samarasinghe, director of USCRI Vermont, said many of her clients had been confused by the flurry of notifications from 3SquaresVT program officials. Not only had many of them contained contradictory information as federal policy shifted rapidly, Samarasinghe said, but many people hadn’t received notifications in a language they spoke.
The loss in benefits came as a result of Vermont’s interpretation of July’s budget law, which, according to state officials, subjected Special Immigrant Visa holders to a five-year waiting period before they become eligible for food assistance. As the state only began accepting visa holders in this group in 2021, very few individuals, if any, in that community remained eligible for SNAP. 
Special Immigrant Visa holders like Hafiza and her daughter should soon begin to receive food assistance again following the latest USDA guidance, officials said Thursday.
Despite the difficulties she has encountered, Hafiza said she primarily feels grateful to be in the U.S. 
“I’m here, and I’m with my daughter,” she said in an interview translated from Dari by USCRI caseworker Hasina Mohammadi. “It’s good — (I) feel happy.”
Her daughter attends the local high school. She’s focused on finishing her education right now, the daughter said, and learning English as soon as possible so she can find a good job.
While glad to be in Vermont, Hafiza hopes desperately that the siblings who were forced to remain in Afghanistan will be able to join her soon. Given their father’s work employment with U.S. agents, she is concerned about retribution from the Taliban.
One of her other daughters, who is unmarried, calls often from Kabul, crying, Hafiza said.
“I left her alone,” she said. “It’s very hard for me.”
Hafiza’s daughter said what little money she and her mother have been able to save would soon be spent. Benefits restarting will be crucial for them.
“Next month we don’t have anything,” she said, referring to December.

‘I’m just thinking about my kids’
Other Afghans on Special Immigrant Visas in Vermont said they had encountered similar struggles.
Mohammed waited for years with his family in Afghanistan before receiving visa approval from the United States. During the war, he had been hired as an airport security guard in Jalalabad. His name is being withheld for his safety and that of his family.
He now lives in Colchester with his wife and six children. Because the kids are all minors, and Mohammed has a green card, he still receives a fraction of the food benefits he used to receive. Because Mohammed is the sole provider for the household, with the high cost of food, transportation and other necessities, it’s been hard to make ends meet, much less plan ahead, he said.
“It’s not enough,” Mohammed said of the reduced payments, in an interview translated from Pashto by Mohammadi. “These things (are) expensive.”
He’s asked for money from a friend, which should help for now. But his options for earning are limited — an injury has forced him to temporarily leave his job at a food manufacturing operation.
“Everything is heavy, physical … they don’t have anything else for me to do,” he said of his employer. “I’m looking for a different job.”
Lately, he’s been finding it difficult to think straight, Mohammed said. He’s inundated with high-stakes paperwork that he can’t understand without help, and with worry for his family.
He produced a photo of his youngest daughter, gazing back at the camera through large sunglasses.
“I’m responsible for everything,” Mohammed said. “I’m just thinking about my kids.”
Several state lawmakers in Vermont had raised the alarm on the issue of food assistance for people like Mohammed, including House Human Services Committee chair Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury. 
“These were people that we specifically welcomed to Vermont,” she said of Special Immigrant Visa holders last week. “We have a moral obligation to do what we can to help people who … assisted the United States government.”
Roughly 650 Afghans live in Vermont, many of whom hold Special Immigrant Visas.
Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, said her team had offered to assist the state and “reenroll eligible individuals as quickly as possible.” Gray emphasized that for her clients, food assistance is generally a temporary measure to help them find their feet. 
Ending SNAP for noncitizen groups blocks them from other programs that use food assistance eligibility as their own bar for access, Gray noted, such as the Crop Cash nutrition program run by the Northeast Organic Farming Alliance of Vermont. She’s also concerned that the same groups will soon lose other benefits, like Medicaid, come next year.
Samarasinghe’s team, as well as other providers around the state, are fundraising to try and help those who remain ineligible for benefits where they can, she said.
But for those like Kambale and his family, no clear reprieve is in sight.
“I’m able to pay for housing,” Kambale said, “but with the cuts (to food assistance) it kind of complicates everything.”
“It’s really kind of threatening to my family, and my stay here,” he said.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Thursday denied a demand from the U.S. Department of Justice for the state’s full voter registration list, including personally identifiable information such as dates of birth, driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers. 
At a special meeting Thursday afternoon and in a letter sent in response to the DOJ demand, WEC stated that Wisconsin law explicitly prevents the commission from sharing the personal information of voters. 
“The U.S. DOJ is simply asking the commission to do something the commission is explicitly forbidden by Wisconsin law to do,” commissioner Don Millis said. 
This is the second time this year the DOJ has requested Wisconsin’s voter database. Both times, the department has been informed that Wisconsin state law requires that the commission charge a fee to obtain the list. 
Since the summer, the DOJ has requested the voter databases of several states — raising concerns over why the department is seeking massive amounts of voter data, especially as President Donald Trump has remained fixated on conspiracy theories that his 2020 election loss was rigged. 
In its demand for the data, sent Dec. 2 as a “confidential memorandum of understanding” the department said it was seeking the data to check if Wisconsin is properly complying with the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act. 
VRLData Sharing Agreement DOJ-WI
“The Justice Department is requesting your state’s [Voter Registration List] to test, analyze, and assess states’ VRLs for proper list maintenance and compliance with federal law,” the memo states. 
However the WEC response questions the authority with which DOJ is asserting its right to the records. For one, Wisconsin is exempt from the NVRA because it offers same-day voter registration at polling places. Also, WEC wrote in its response letter that HAVA does not grant the DOJ access to confidential voter data. 
Compliance with HAVA and the thoroughness of states’ compliance with voter list maintenance requirements have become regular talking points among Republicans who say they’re concerned that there are thousands of people who have active voter registrations when they should be ineligible to vote because they’ve moved, died or otherwise are unable to cast a ballot. 
The sources of those complaints include the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a right-wing law firm that in October sent a letter to the DOJ asking for the department to assess Wisconsin’s compliance with HAVA. 
WEC has said repeatedly that the commission and Wisconsin’s municipal election clerks are properly maintaining the voter rolls. They’ve also noted that the concerns are often overstated because even if a voter is ineligible and their file is deactivated in the database, their name will still appear in the system. 
WEC Letter – Resp to 12.2.25 DOJ Correspondence
“The joint effort between state and local election officials enhances the integrity of the system by ensuring responsibilities are distributed across thousands of officials in every city, village, and town, rather than concentrated among a small handful of state employees in the Capitol,” the WEC response letter states. “The vast majority of list maintenance work consists of routine updates, and the processes also serve to identify attempts at wrongdoing. Each year, Wisconsin election officials at all levels of government identify and refer to criminal prosecution: felons attempting to vote, double voters, non-citizens, and others trying to circumvent election law.” 
In the WEC decision to deny DOJ’s request as well as to release the DOJ memo and the response letter, Republican commissioner Bob Spindell was the lone vote against. Spindell pointed to a provision of state law that allows WEC to share restricted information in the voter database with law enforcement agencies. Spindell has often used his role on the commission to indulge conspiracy theories and cast doubt on the security of the election system. 
“This is a highly, highly controversial issue throughout the country at this point in time, and my point of view is that this information can be released,” Spindell said. “I believe that through the HAVA Act, the federal government has the appropriate ability to see if we’re doing everything that’s correct and OK. I’ve talked forever about we need to have, in the state of Wisconsin, an independent audit, or whatever, of the registration list to satisfy the many individuals and groups and so forth that question it. And all HAVA is doing here, the federal government is asking for a chance to take a look at us.” 
But commissioner Mark Thomsen said there is no way that a provision meant to help law enforcement find information about suspects in criminal investigations could be interpreted to mean WEC can give the personal information of every Wisconsin voter to the federal government. 
“Our rights as commissioners are limited by the Fourth Amendment, by state law itself,” Thomsen said. “Mr. Spindel is just flat out wrong that this one provision that he relies on would allow us to legally give Wisconsin citizens’ private information off to someone for some unknown reason. It’s not just a person that’s suspected of a crime, it’s everybody, and Wisconsin has never stood for the proposition that any government is entitled to all this data anytime someone asked. So I think Bob, you’re just making up the law there.”

I remember walking on the beach at Lake Huron, not far from our family cottage,  back in the 1990s. My feet were sort of crunching along in the sand, and I thought, “What in the world is this?”
We all knew the lake well. My great grandparents had bought the land in the 1940s. But things were different that summer.
The arrival of the zebra mussel changed the food web, the water clarity and the lake itself. It’s one of the few times I recall where there were distinct changes in its water level and quality.
The region came to understand how the zebra mussels got here, and how to stop them, thanks to the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL). Over the years, this lab, among other things, built a program to study invasive species. And we haven’t had any new invaders for decades.
This amazing institution just celebrated its 50th anniversary. Now it stands to be decimated, or shut down entirely, through federal funding cuts. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Based in Ann Arbor, GLERL is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It provides the data, forecasts and long term scientific research that keep us and our food and water safe, support maritime commerce and ensure the health and resilience of the largest freshwater system on Earth.
I was lucky enough to work there for about 10 years. It was a dream job–and absolutely what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Last year, I was promoted. So when the federal government began terminating “probationary” employees earlier this year, my job ended abruptly. I found out through an email during a doctor appointment – I was terminated with 90 minutes notice.
Now, I just want people to understand what we could lose.
Research and forecasting sound wonky, but this lab’s work keeps you, your family and your pets in the Great Lakes region safe.
Millions of people depend on the Great Lakes’ water supply. Trump decimated the lab protecting it.

From shipping to fishing to tourism, everything we do on the Lakes depends on weather conditions. Researchers at GLERL understand how the lakes move, how they interact with the atmosphere, and how they’re affected by weather patterns, which makes for better forecasts of things like lake effect snow.
They understand “meteotsunamis,” in which waves created by atmospheric pressure push the water up, dramatically changing its level very quickly, which can pose significant danger. There’s currently no warning system for the Great Lakes–a key example of how we need to invest in GLERL to continue developing the science.
GLERL helps the National Weather Service issue marine warnings through wave and ice models. It supports U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue operations with real-time lake data. GLERL works with the Coast Guard as they respond to, clean up and contain oil spills. Its ecological monitoring and other research protects $6 billion in fisheries.
An algal bloom in one of the Great Lakes can yield poisons and heavy metals that can contaminate and shut down a city’s drinking water system, threaten residents and cost millions of dollars. GLERL’s monitoring, toxin reporting and remote sensing capability has helped scientists understand where the toxic part of the bloom is, and vastly expanded information for local water treatment managers. For tourism, NOAA’s information on algal blooms helps the charter boat industry, for example, make decisions about where charters will go in a given season.
I could cite so many more examples – about the invasive carp, habitat protection and restoration, and treaties with Canada. But here’s the point: this lab costs the average household 7 cents a year and delivers lifesaving results. Right now, there are Congressionally-mandated duties going unfulfilled, because there are just not enough employees to do them.
Tell your local leaders and congressional representatives how important it is to fund NOAA and preserve this data powerhouse for our region and the health and well being of our communities.
My grandfather passed away before I took that job at GLERL. But I really wish I could share all of the lab’s amazing findings with him. He would have been so interested in the amount of data and research that went into understanding those invasive mussels.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NOAA-pic.jpg,,,2025-12-12 06:57:36.004710

But for many Wyoming families, their seasonal harvest is an outdoor endeavor.

Parts of eight national forests extend into the Equality State, and there are also eight Bureau of Land Management field offices spread across Wyoming. All offer Christmas tree permits. They’re inexpensive, ranging from $1 on BLM land to $15 on the Bridger-Teton National Forest.

Near dusk on a Monday in early December, Ada Brennan, 2, and her sister, Frances, 4, set out into the Shoshone National Forest with their tante, Jordan Schreiber, to select a Christmas tree.
Pickings were slim near a well-used trailhead a short drive from the nearest town. Trees in easy reach for a toddler were either too short, too tall or too mangled.

Eventually, the party eyed a symmetrical-enough fir that had escaped prior Christmas tree hunters’ saw blades, perhaps because it sprouted along a pretty steep slope. 
Not long later, the conifer was on the ground and being dragged down a trail on its way to a Lander living room.

Holidays are a time of reflection. What parts of Wyoming make you thankful and hopeful, asks columnist Khale Lenhart. 
The post Gratitude and hope for Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","This month, between Thanksgiving and Christmas, is a fitting time for reflection. Our focus turns toward family and community, and the changing weather causes us to slow down. It is a good time to take stock of the society around us. The Thanksgiving holiday naturally turns our minds to what we are grateful for — what already exists that we cherish. Christmas is a holiday of hope, focused on the promise of what is yet to come. With these holidays in mind, let us reflect on what parts of our state we are thankful for and hopeful about.

Opinion

Perhaps the thing Wyomingites hold most dear is our heritage. Culturally, we are descended from pioneers and settlers — or from those who came before — and we take that frontier heritage to heart. We value independence, community and overcoming challenges. We are willing to endure hardship to build a life that we want, and we are closely attuned to the natural world and the benefits that it provides. Above all else, we know that our perch in this place is still precarious. These are perspectives that are hard to find elsewhere. They set us apart. By embracing these values, we create a society that fits our circumstances. These ideas would not fit in other places, but they fit here, and for that I am grateful. 
I am also thankful for the good stewardship of our forefathers. Wyoming is a harsh place and it’s challenging to thrive here. Most of our land is arid and inhospitable, our physical conditions are difficult, and we are remote from most modern conveniences and luxuries. With poor planning or shortsighted leadership, this place could easily fall into decline. 
Fortunately, we have been blessed with the opposite. The state’s early settlers understood the importance of building the infrastructure that would allow for growth. When it became clear that natural resources would power our economy, our leaders decided to set aside large portions of the state’s mineral revenue to support us in perpetuity. The easy decision — the short-sighted decision — would have been to spend those dollars on the needs of the day. They certainly could have built some nice things, and those projects would have been popular. They also would have been fleeting. Because of wise leadership and decisions that focused on the long-term, we all benefit from our state’s bounty.
Just as we are grateful for the good decisions of the past, we should be hopeful for the future. Despite our state’s challenges, there are many good reasons to have hope. First, our state is full of opportunity. We have space, natural resources, and the ability to be nimble when it comes to building regulatory structures that can support new industries. Our people are hard-working and determined. We have existing expertise in manufacturing and mining that is missing in many other parts of the country. Our climate and location give Wyoming an advantage in attracting computing facilities to locate here. If we take advantage of the opportunities in front of us, Wyoming is poised to thrive, and that gives me hope.
I am also hopeful because there appears to be a growing consensus on the issues we face, which allows us to better meet these challenges. In surveys and conversations about Wyoming’s future, the challenges of economic diversification and talent retention quickly rise to the top. We recognize where our weaknesses are, which is a significant part of the battle. Once we agree on the problem, we can work to find solutions. 
Finding a fix is often an easier undertaking than identifying the problem itself. Already, drilling into these challenges has helped us recognize the underlying problems connected to affordable housing, livable spaces, health care access and education. Understanding how these fit together and how improvements in one area can lead to improvements in others puts us on a much more manageable path. It will still not be easy to overcome our hurdles, but the fact that we must wrestle with difficult problems is not unusual or unique. We have answered big questions before. Now that we have a growing consensus on what those problems are, I am far more hopeful about our ability to move forward.
In this holiday season, we should take the time to contemplate the world around us. Self-reflection is important. We should look both behind us and ahead of us, toward the past and gratitude and the future and hope. Our state gives us plenty to consider on both accounts.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin should make child care universally available, just as public education is, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes said Thursday during a child care center visit that was part of the rollout for his campaign for governor.
“I support having full, comprehensive, universal childcare,” Barnes told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview that followed a round table session with providers, parents and child care policy analysts. “I, for sure, hope others understand the urgency of this issue, understand the complexity of it as well, and we’ll be ready to fight tooth and nail to do everything we can to improve the system for our providers, for our parents and most importantly, for the young people, for the students, for our children.”
The round table took place at the Art House Preschool, a Waunakee child care center.
Barnes is not the first Democratic hopeful in the 2026 race for governor to visit the Art House. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley held a round table on child care issues in November at the same location. And virtually every other active Democratic primary candidate in the governor’s race mentions affordable child care on their website as a priority of their campaigns.
During his event Thursday, Barnes coupled state funding for child care with his support for better public education funding.
“If we aren’t invested in children, what are we doing as a state? What are we doing as a country?” he asked at the start of the nearly hour-long discussion. “We need to ensure, one, that our schools, K-12, are fully funded, but also that our children are ready to enter K-12. And that means that early childhood education has support.”
During most of the session, Barnes refrained from lengthy policy prescriptions and focused instead on questions for the round table participants — asking for both their biggest challenges and their “biggest ideas” for addressing Wisconsin’s child care needs.
“Direct investment to providers, I believe, would be the best to keep people from closing their doors,” said Heather Murray, the owner of Art House, who has been a child care provider for nearly two decades. “I like to call it a public good, because I don’t believe it can exist without government funding.”
Stephanie Frontz is an IT specialist and the mother of four, one of them at Art House. She recently gave birth to infant twins who are slated to be enrolled there.
“We need the help there so the state can help pay fair wages,” Frontz said. That will  ensure child care workers stay, which in turn makes it possible for more parents to work, she added. “It impacts my family and the economy if I can’t work.”
Child care providers who have a shortage of teachers reduce the hours that they’re open, said Carly Eaton, a parent whose day job is with an organized labor environmental group.
She understands why, but jobs in construction, manufacturing and especially health care often “don’t fit in the 7 a.m. to 6 a.m. hours that you may be able to find child care,” Eaton said. “To hear legislators on a certain side of the aisle talk about the worker shortage and then not do anything about child care just breaks my brain.”
During the COVID-19 pandemic, federal relief funds included money designated for child care. In Wisconsin that money went to the Child Care Counts program, which originally distributed $20 million a month to the state’s child care providers.
The monthly support was later cut in half and extended through mid-2025 after the GOP majority in the Wisconsin Legislature rejected the proposal Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, made in the 2023-25 state budget to continue the subsidy with state funds.
Evers again proposed ongoing state funding in the 2025-27 budget. “I heard a lot of people say during the last budget cycle, ‘We can’t just keep writing checks …. It didn’t work,’” said Kayla Gardner, engagement specialist at the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association. “It actually did — it very much did work.”
“When the payments were the highest, we had very few closures,” said Paula Drew, director of early childhood education policy and research at WECA. “It stabilized the field.”
When the current budget finally passed in late June, it for the first time included some direct state funding for centers, but just for one year and at a smaller amount than Evers or child care advocates originally sought.
That money helped, said Jenn Bilderback, administrative director of Big Oak Child Care in Madison. But it also came with restrictions that made it less accessible for some providers and it will go away in June 2026.
“We have to do something that’s much more universal and that allows the flexibility for a provider,” Bilderback told Barnes.
She said her center’s board of directors, most of whom are parents, have supported providing benefits — a rarity for many child care providers — and paying a living wage. “We need to do this, but the cost of living in Madison and outside Madison is increasing too high to be able to keep up with that.”
Barnes — who along with most Democrats running for elected office in the 2026 cycle has seized on affordability as a campaign theme — responded that “the cost of living is top of mind for everybody.” But then he turned back to her earlier comments.
“You mentioned ‘something more universal,’ Barnes said. “I want you to say the thing out loud. Somebody can say it — universal child care, right?”
“We do dream big, and we do think of all these things,” said Gardner. “But what we see in return is almost nothing.”
Drew said that with turnover among child care teachers, programs are often operating at less than capacity, even as parents have trouble finding care.
“We don’t necessarily, right now, need new buildings, because we’ve got 33,000 open spots . . . across the state. We need teachers that can be working in programs to open up those 33,000 spots,” Drew said. “We’ve got the demand, but we also need the supply available in early education.”
Katie Licitis, an Art House Preschool teacher, said she first took the job four years ago after she and her husband moved to Wisconsin from Georgia. For the first time, she said, she needed child care after having been a stay-at-home mom until then. But with the turnover that providers are seeing, she asked Barnes, “Do you have a plan to retain teachers?”
“You shouldn’t have to choose between a job you love and Kwik Trip, as an example, because they’re paying more money, right?” Barnes replied. “Like, that’s an indictment on the way that things have been going. And I think that’s a big part of the broader universal child care package. And I don’t think people should be shy about wanting universal child care in this state. I think that this is exactly one of those areas that Wisconsin should be a leader in the nation.”

Now, as assistant secretary at the U.S. Administration for Children and Families, he's providing support for other states to do the same. (Photo illustration by iStock/Getty Images Plus)A federal official from Idaho is taking steps in his new post to end a nationwide practice of states collecting Social Security benefits entitled to foster youth and using it to pay for the children’s care. 
The U.S. Administration for Children and Families, or ACF, on Thursday announced it notified governors of the 39 states that had not yet taken action to end the practice of keeping foster youth’s Social Security survivor benefits. 
ACF Assistant Secretary Alex Adams previously told the Idaho Capital Sun that he’d first become aware that Idaho had done this when he became director of the state Department of Health and Welfare. 
Adams in May issued a directive to the state agency to end the practice of using Social Security survivor benefits entitled to foster youth to pay for their basic care by July 2026. The memo directed staff to either use the funds to pay for unmet needs, not typically covered for other foster youth, or conserve them for the child’s future use. 
This practice affected Idaho native Scott Matlock, a current NFL fullback for the Los Angeles Chargers and a former foster youth. Matlock entered Idaho’s child welfare system as a 13-year-old following the death of both of his parents, according to a press release from the Administration for Children and Families. He never received any of his parents’ survivor benefits. 
“I commend President (Donald) Trump, Secretary (Robert F.) Kennedy (Jr.), and Assistant Secretary Adams for taking decisive action to encourage states to protect children and ensure foster youth have a strong financial foundation,” Matlock said in the release. “My hope is the next kid coming through foster care gets every penny he or she deserves, no matter what state they live in.”
Former Idaho health official brings same foster home focus to federal post

Following Adams’ Senate nomination in October to his federal post, which resides in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, he told the Sun in a November interview he planned to address the issue at the national level. 
He said that many of the leaders in states where the practice was ongoing may not be aware of it. 
A 2021 NPR and Marshall Project report found that 49 states and Washington, D.C., had engaged in this process at the time. National attorney and advocate Amy Harfeld told the Sun she’d been campaigning across the country to end the widespread practice. At the time, she said Adams’ move to end the practice in Idaho without outside intervention set him apart. 
“Most states have not done this by themselves,” she said in a previous interview, “and so that really does distinguish (Adams) here, and it’s exciting that it distinguishes the state at this moment where he is going to have such a big stage and authority and capacity to make changes like this.”
To date, 11 states have enacted policies to prohibit taking children’s benefits, according to the ACF press release.  
“ACF and the Social Security Administration plan to provide resources, in addition to existing technical assistance, to help the remaining 39 states change this practice,” the release said.
Adams in the emailed release, said, “Every earned benefit dollar belongs to these foster youth, not the government agencies or bureaucrats. Protecting children is the core mission of child welfare, and we will keep the best interests of the child front and center in all our efforts.”

Tom Tiffany and Democratic former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, have denounced the unlimited flow of cash into state political campaigns. Then, practically in the same breath, both men announced their plans to raise tens of millions of dollars, signalling to their less well funded primary opponents that they might as well get out of the way.
In an interview with PBS Wisconsin on Dec. 5, Tiffany criticized “that pass-through loophole, I call it the ‘billionaire loophole,’” in Wisconsin law, adding, “there’s just so much money that comes into Wisconsin.” 
“You can cry about it or you can compete,” Tiffany continued. “We choose to compete … We’re hoping to raise $40 million.”
As Baylor Spears reports, Tiffany actually voted for the “billionaire loophole” he now criticizes back when he was serving in the state Senate in 2015. 
Mandela Barnes, in a recent campaign stop in Madison, told Spears and other reporters that he has raised a “strong haul,” in the first week of his campaign, and that he intends to raise a staggering $50 million by the end of the race. He added that he doesn’t like the role of money in politics. “It’s not a good sign,” he said, and his future goal is “to get big money out of politics” and enact “campaign and ethics reform.”
Back in 2015, when Republicans were ramming through the “billionaire loophole,” Barnes opposed it, saying at the time that it would allow “shady special interest money and allow for more corruption to go undetected and unprosecuted.”
Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, remembers that moment well. Under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker, Republican legislative majorities passed the law eviscerating campaign finance limits along with other measures getting rid of the nonpartisan Government Accountability Board and eliminating the John Doe procedure that was used to criminally prosecute leaders of both political parties for campaign finance crimes in the infamous caucus scandal of the early 2000’s.
The 2015 law doubled the amount individuals could give to candidates. More importantly, it eliminated all limits on state party contributions to candidates and allowed coordination between candidates and outside groups that make issue ads supporting the campaigns. Donors were able to give as much as they wanted to political parties, which then funneled that money to candidates, creating the billionaire loophole to which Tiffany belatedly objects. The 2015 law cleared the way for outsiders like Elon Musk to pour limitless cash into state races to try to affect the outcome.
“The Republicans did that in 2015 because they were convinced that they would have a great financial advantage since they generally raised more money from donors and special interests,” says Heck. “Of course, what they didn’t anticipate was [former Wisconsin Democratic Party chair] Ben Wikler and the Democratic Party’s ability to take that big hole in the law and use it to raise massive amounts of money.”
Recently, Democrats in Wisconsin have been beating Republicans in the fundraising arms race. In 2025, in the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, Susan Crawford, the candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court supported by the Democratic Party, raised $28.3 million compared with Republican-supported Brad Schimel, who raised $15.1 million. Outside special interests accounted for most of the spending on the race, with Musk alone putting in nearly $20 million through his political action committees and millions more laundered through the state Republican Party for Schimel, while the Democratic Party of Wisconsin funneled $10 million to Crawford.
The lesson of the 2015 law, says Heck, is, “be careful what you wish for.”
That certainly applies to Republicans, who lost the two most expensive state Supreme Court races in history as well as the last two record-breaking gubernatorial races won by Gov. Tony Evers with $93 million in total spending in 2018 and $164 million in 2022. 
But it also applies to Democrats, who cannot count on continually bringing in more money than Republicans.
More importantly, when it costs tens of millions of dollars to win state elections, regular voters’ voices are drowned out by billionaires, who are not investing in candidates just out of the goodness of their hearts.
Heck believes that change will only come when voters demand reform, most likely because a big scandal clearly illustrates that politicians are doing favors for their donors in exchange for campaign cash.
“It’s going to require a bipartisan coming-together to establish some limits,” Heck says. 
Even as the U.S. Supreme Court has opened the floodgate for campaign spending with the Citizens United decision, which in 2010 struck down a federal ban on political donations from corporations, and McCutcheon v. FEC, which in 2014 found that annual caps on total political donations from one person are unconstitutional, states have the ability to impose limits. 
A report by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows Wisconsin is one of only 11 states that allow unlimited candidate contributions by state parties and among the top 10 for the highest limits on PAC contributions to candidates. Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois and most other states limit how much political parties can accept, which reduces the Elon Musk effect. Plus, “We are one of few states that allows so-called coordination between political candidates and outside groups,” Heck says.
The problem is that candidates, while acknowledging that massive amounts of money fueling their campaigns is a bad look, don’t want to unilaterally disarm. 
But now, as the Trump administration drags the country to new levels of overt corruption, it could be a good time for a campaign that ties together billionaires’ destructive influence on society and the fact that they are buying our democracy. 
“There has to be public disgust with the amount of money being spent,” says Heck. “If a candidate put corruption front and center, it might get a lot of traction.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)With the Affordable Care Act subsidies on the chopping block in the Republican-controlled Congress, it’s no surprise the Lee newspapers did an interview with Montana’s former senator Max Baucus.  As the chairman of the Senate’s powerful Finance Committee, Baucus “was chief architect of the Affordable Care Act known as “Obamacare.”
According to Baucus: “For 15 months, I had the committee work on health care, and it was totally nonpolitical. I had several rules. One is if anybody gets political, I’m cutting them off at the knees. We’re trying to address something here, honestly. Second, if anybody has a problem, they’ve got to bring a solution. Third, nothing is off the table. We’re going to consider everything.”
It’s not unusual for politicians to attempt to rewrite history to smooth over the blemishes and polish the successes.  That’s what politicians generally do.  A couple great examples, “the 2020 election was stolen” and on Jan. 6, 2021 the mob that stormed Congress and sent Representatives and Senators fleeing for their lives were merely “tourists.” 
To be kind, perhaps at Baucus’ age of 84 some details of the past aren’t quite remembered correctly. And things definitely look different from Washington, D.C., than they do here in Montana.  But the fact is, Baucus’ rendition of history is lacking some very significant details about the formulation of Obamacare, namely what got considered and what did not, and who did the considering. 
Many of the Montanans who were actively involved in attempting to provide their input to Baucus have passed on, including Eric Feaver, who was the head of Montana’s largest union at the time and who would certainly dispute Baucus’ claim that “nothing is off the table, we’re going to consider everything” when it came to formulating the legislation. 
The fact is Feaver, and the union he led as well as unions nationwide and thousands of Montanans, did not support Baucus’ plan to stick the insurance industry squarely between patients and their health care providers.  What they did support wholeheartedly was a single-payer system – which did not include the rapacious health insurance industry and assured citizens they would be covered for their treatments by a single public system without ever-rising premiums, co-pays and out-of-pocket costs.  Baucus, however, said single payer was “off the table.” 
Make no mistake, Feaver, his union members, and hundreds of Montanans didn’t just send emails or phone calls to Baucus’ office, they demonstrated all over the state, gave speeches, and marched en masse to his Helena office to protest his plan and support single payer —not just once, but many times, including once when the large crowd arrived to find the doors to Baucus’ Helena office locked in mid-day presumably because Baucus didn’t want to hear what they had to say. 
In the meantime, back in D.C., Baucus had hired Liz Fowler, a former insurance industry executive, as his chief health counsel on the Finance Committee.  As noted in an interesting interview with Fowler, she admits that President Obama did not support Baucus’ mandate that individuals must purchase health insurance.  Unfortunately, Obama got the same reception we Montanans got — and the bill included the insurance mandate, putting the insurance industry firmly in charge of Americans’ health care.
Were it not for that mandate, the current concern over millions of citizens losing their health coverage because Congress won’t extend the subsidies wouldn’t exist.

The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department. As the Trump administration sheds staff and funding at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a new analysis places Louisiana among states that have notably slashed their pollution regulation resources even as industry expands.
The report from the Environmental Integrity Project evaluated staffing and changes in operating budgets at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality and comparable agencies in other states. From 2010 through 2024, the numbers show the agency’s personnel count decreased 24% with 222 positions eliminated from the agency. The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department. 
“These cuts increase the risk that residents will face higher levels of pollution, especially if the EPA lacks the funding and capacity to do its job,” Environmental Integrity Project executive director Jen Duggan said Wednesday during a news conference for the report’s release.
“In Louisiana, we feel them deeply,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade who also took part in the news conference.
The report focused on the Department of Environmental Quality’s operating budget, or the money it spends to handle day-to-day tasks such as paying employees, maintaining facilities, lab analysis and grants to local governments. Large loans and federal grants, which are considered as capital costs, were excluded from the analysis where possible to avoid outliers because they vary widely from year to year and “do not measure a state’s capacity” to limit pollution, according to the report’s methodology.
The staffing cuts at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality are “among the most of any state,” according to the report. Other standouts included Mississippi, which reduced its environmental agency funding 71% from 2010 to 2024.
On the other end of the spectrum is California, which increased its environmental operating budget by 364% over the same 14 years.
At the federal level, the Trump administration has said it intends to bring the EPA’s employee count down to levels last seen during the Reagan era, when the agency had between 11,000 and 14,000 people of staff, NPR reported. It began Trump’s second term with about 15,000 employees.
The majority of environmental agency staffing cuts in Louisiana happened during Bobby Jindal’s terms as governor from 2008-16. The Department of Environmental Quality has not seen significant hiring or funding boosts dating back to Edwin Edwards’ fourth term as governor from 1992-96. 
The agency’s boldest policy moves came after Gov. Buddy Roemer took office in 1988. He  placed environmental scientist Paul Templet in charge of Environmental Quality, and the administration tied industrial incentives to benchmarks for reducing pollution. Since Roemer lost his reelection bid in 1991, governors who have succeeded him have, to varying degrees, urged cooperation with industry. 
The Environmental Integrity Project report points out cuts in Department of Environmental Quality staff and funding come as Louisiana sees a boom in industrial investment. The number of facilities seeking air pollution control permits from the state rose 29% from 2016-24, with 1,906 applications last year according to the report’s analysis of public records. 
A spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality responded to the report in a statement, saying the department meets all federal grant requirements and performance expectations while prioritizing “efficiency” and remaining “fully committed” to environmental protection. 
The department has implemented an expedited permitting program to make up for its staffing shortages, allowing applicants to pay for agency staff members’ overtime as they work on the approval process. 
Rolfes cites issues with this process in the report, saying it creates a conflict of interest. 
“When you cut the resources of the agencies, you further depend on the companies themselves as the source of payment for permit writers — and that is an inherent conflict,” Rolfes wrote in the report. “When you have the company paying your overtime, you are just not going to ask the questions and scrutinize it the way you would if your salaries were being paid by the public.”
The analysis also identified Louisiana as having the highest amount of toxic air emissions per square mile of any state in the country. Staffing shortages also play a role in delayed response time to pollution issues, according to the report.
In 2019, the Environmental Integrity Project report counted only 10 LDEQ employees who handled all air enforcement actions at more than 500 major industrial facilities and hundreds more smaller locations. A Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report from 2021 also found the department was understaffed and could do more to address air pollution violations.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/smokestacks.jpg,,,2025-12-12 06:57:36.004710

(Photos: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Nashville car magnate and political donor Lee Beaman is distancing himself from a federal investigation into the campaign finance filings of U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles.
But playing dumb about being named treasurer for Ogles’ first congressional campaign in 2022 couldn’t keep his nomination for a post on the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors from being postponed this week. It is unclear when, or if, it will be revived by the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. 
When Senate Democrats grilled him in a hearing last week, Beaman said he served as Ogles’ campaign treasurer for only four months. But he filed written responses afterward repeatedly saying he never agreed to be Ogles’ treasurer and had no knowledge of a questionable $320,000 loan Ogles reported on a Federal Election Commission filing. Beaman said Ogles asked him in a text message to serve as campaign treasurer in early 2022 but that he didn’t answer.
Despite not agreeing to take the job, Beaman said in his official responses to senators he thought it was an “honorary” position and that he didn’t sign any FEC reports even though his name appeared on them. 
This wasn’t Beaman’s first deal with Ogles. As ProPublica reported in March, Beaman said he planned to raise $4 million in 2017 when Ogles announced a bid for U.S. Senate that didn’t come to fruition.
Tennessee U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles’ campaign finance reports still don’t add up

An Ogles spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment.
None of the senators asked Beaman whether he thought Ogles committed fraud by putting his name on FEC documents without permission.
The former owner of multiple Nashville auto dealerships and Beaman Bottling Company said he asked that he be removed as treasurer after seeing an ad listing his name.
Previously, the House Ethics Committee found Ogles likely violated federal campaign finance laws, mainly by reporting an inflated personal loan to make his bid for office look stronger in 2022. Ogles initially said he raised $450,000 for the race, yet his first FEC report showed he brought in only $250,000.
Ogles amended campaign finance reports in May 2024 and acknowledged making a $20,000 loan to his campaign and saying the additional $300,000 was in a joint account he shared with his wife.
Beaman said he had “nothing to do” with the FEC report filed in July 2022 showing the $320,000 loan and wasn’t familiar with allegations surrounding it until they were reported by local media much later.
According to committee questioning, the Ogles for Congress campaign issued a press release in July 2022 stating that Ogles “did direct donors to a few independent expenditure groups they were planning to assist in my getting elected.”
Beaman, though, said other than being a donor, during his time as campaign chairman he wasn’t overly involved in a dark money-group called Volunteers for Freedom Super PAC that backed Ogles’ candidacy three years ago. It’s illegal for campaigns and PACs whose money is not traceable to coordinate.

Beaman said he and his attorney started researching the dark-money question but didn’t know about a “donor-direction scheme” by Ogles because he didn’t know he was the campaign treasurer.
None of this scared Beaman off of political work: He and his wife, Julie, a former Williamson County Republican Party chair, recently served as co-chairs for U.S. Rep. Matt Van Epps’ campaign. 
But despite asking to be removed as treasurer, Beaman said he didn’t become aware Ogles became treasurer for a short time until after the House Ethics Committee contacted him in September 2025. Political operative Thomas Datwyler, who also has numerous questions surrounding his work, then took the job.
“I am aware of certain prohibitions. My only involvement was as a donor to the Ogles campaign and to the Volunteers for Freedom Super PAC. I did not engage in any coordinated activity between these two entities,” said Beaman, who was removed from the Belmont University Board of Trustees in 2018 following salacious accusations against him in divorce proceedings. He returned to the board in 2021.
One Democratic senator broached the allegations Beaman’s ex-wife made but declined to specify them in the hearing because they’re just too embarrassing.
“Deja vu all over again”
With apologies to the late Yankees Hall of Famer Yogi Berra, we’ve been here before.
When the Tennessee Supreme Court sided with Gov. Bill Lee, striking down a challenge of his first private-school voucher law, it ran a flanking maneuver around the state’s Home Rule Amendment, which requires approval from local governments when targeted by the legislature. In short, the court decided Metro Nashville Public Schools aren’t part of the Metro Nashville government, or some such nincompoopery.
Yogi’s redundancy is fitting here because, once again, the Supreme Court found that the Constitution doesn’t mean what it says, this time in regard to a challenge of Senate redistricting maps the legislature adopted in 2022.
In split rulings that would leave 99.99% of the public in complete confusion, the court ruled against Nashville resident Francie Hunt’s challenge of Senate redistricting maps, deciding she didn’t even have standing to sue. Hunt claimed the Senate plan was unconstitutional in that it failed to enact consecutively numbered districts in Davidson County to ensure two districts would be selected during a presidential election year and two in a gubernatorial election year.
Supremely unconstitutional? A ruling by the Tennessee Supreme Court struck down an earlier ruling on a 2022 legislative redistricting plan. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
The idea is to keep most or all of the Senate seats in counties with multiple districts from changing in one fell swoop.
But the court found Hunt couldn’t even prove enough injury to sue, only that she was wronged in a legal sense. Thus, it never really resolved the argument.
Only Justice Holly Kirby, who is retiring from the court halfway through 2026, had the guts to say there was no precedent or legal basis for the ruling. She was appointed to the court by former Gov. Bill Haslam.
Meanwhile, the justices found that Gibson County resident Gary Wygant had standing to challenge the House redistricting map that split his county in two. But it decided his challenge could affect only Gibson County, not the rest of the state. 
Of course, the House districts in Gibson County could be reconfigured only if others were redrawn to reach the right numbers and racial requirements, so why bother?
Under the law, districts can be drawn to protect incumbents.
District 18 held by Republican Sen. Ferrell Haile of Gallatin had to be reshaped to take in tiny Trousdale County. Previously, it contained Old Hickory and other parts of Davidson County, ensuring Metro Nashville had consecutively-numbered Senate districts.
The Republican-controlled Senate redrew Lebanon Sen. Mark Pody’s District 17 out of rural counties into the Donelson/Percy Priest area, which wouldn’t necessarily protect his seat in 2026.
That move made it easier for Republican Sen. Shane Reeves of Murfreesboro to keep his post southeast of Nashville.
Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, obviously, was pleased with the decision.
“We carefully and cautiously drew a fair and legal map and I am grateful the court has allowed that map to stand,” McNally said in a statement. 
McNally and Secretary of State Tre Hargett congratulated Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and his office on the win.
Democrats weren’t quite as enthused, saying the Supreme Court relinquished its authority to keep the legislature and executive branch in check.










That is a breathtaking step backward. This is the kind of radical decision that wipes away constitutional protections for the sake of insulating political power.


– Sen. London Lamar, D-Memphis


“Courts exist to safeguard our constitutional rights, not to create new barriers for citizens who seek to enforce them. I am deeply concerned that this decision closes the courthouse doors to everyday citizens and erodes the balance of powers our Constitution requires,” said Democratic Sen. Raumesh Akbari of Memphis.
Democratic Sen. London Lamar of Memphis called the ruling “devastating” for people who believe they have at least a shred of constitutional rights.
“That is a breathtaking step backward. This is the kind of radical decision that wipes away constitutional protections for the sake of insulating political power,” Lamar said in a statement.
Democrats point out the Supreme Court holds the distinction of being the nation’s first court to rule that a citizen lacks the legal right to challenge the constitutionality of their own voting district.
It’s not clear when the trophies will be handed out for this groundbreaking decision. But we have a feeling similar ones will follow. The justices need only perform a few legal cartwheels and, man, they’re already there.
Late lawmaker replaced
The Montgomery County Commission voted this week to fill the District 75 seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Jeff Burkhart of Clarksville.
According to ClarksvilleNow, Mayor Wes Golden broke a tie vote to make County Commissioner Michael Lankford the new representative, edging out Democrat Allie Phillips. Phillips ran against Burkhart in 2024.
Lankford will fill the rest of Burkhart’s term until elections in 2026. 
We’ll see whether he can stand the excitement.
Heavy hearts
Lawmakers are mourning the death of former House Majority Leader Gerald McCormick this week after a battle with Lou Gehrig’s disease.
“Though we stood on different sides of the aisle, as the Republican Majority Leader, he approached his position with fairness, integrity, and a genuine willingness to listen,” said House Democratic Leader Karen Camper.

Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons added that those who worked with McCormick will “miss his quick smile and hearty handshake.”
House Republicans said in a statement they are “heartbroken” over the death of McCormick.
“As a United States Army veteran, legislator and House majority leader, McCormick played a pivotal role in advancing the values and freedoms that make our state and our nation a beacon of success,” the caucus said.
McCormick left the legislature in 2018 and sold his Chattanooga house, acknowledging that Nashville was becoming his primary home. 
While lawmakers remember him fondly, a few folks probably recall he was good at delivering what some would refer to as an old-fashioned butt chewing, and that’s putting it kindly.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Forest Service)Mountain States Policy Center’s senior policy analyst Madi Clark recently argued that the Fix Our Forests Act may be enough to fix our public lands management backlog. In truth, the act is not just inadequate — it is a bad bill that risks deepening the very problems it claims to solve. By doubling down on outdated strategies and prioritizing logging interests, the act distracts from the real solutions Idaho needs: climate‑smart management and investments in community safety through home hardening and defensible space.
The Fix Our Forests Act leans heavily on thinning and prescribed burns as its primary tools. While these practices can play a role in targeted areas, they are not panaceas. Broad‑brush thinning often destabilizes ecosystems, removes critical wildlife habitat, and can even increase fire spread when not carefully planned.
Fix Our Forests Act may be enough to fix our public lands management backlog

Even more troubling, many logging operations conducted under the guise of “forest restoration” remove large‑diameter, fire‑resistant trees — the very trees most capable of surviving wildfire and anchoring healthy forest ecosystems. Stripping out these natural firebreaks leaves forests more vulnerable, not less.
The bill’s emphasis on “restoration” masks a troubling reality: It opens the door to expanded logging under the guise of wildfire prevention. This approach prioritizes timber industry profits over ecological resilience. Idahoans deserve legislation that protects forests for recreation, wildlife, and water resources — not one that commodifies them for short‑term gain.
Perhaps the most glaring flaw in the act is its silence on climate change. Wildfires are intensifying because summers are hotter, droughts are more prolonged, and snowpack is shrinking. Without integrating climate adaptation strategies — watershed protection, carbon sequestration, biodiversity safeguards — the Fix Our Forests Act is little more than a Band‑Aid on a gaping wound. Ignoring climate realities ensures that any gains from thinning or burning will be quickly erased by the next megafire season.
Clark frames the act as a way to reduce the backlog, but in practice, it adds new layers of bureaucracy while failing to address structural inefficiencies. Agencies will be tasked with more paperwork and reporting requirements, diverting resources from actual on‑the‑ground restoration. The backlog will grow, not shrink.
Most troubling, the act does little to empower local communities, tribes, or private landowners who are essential partners in wildfire prevention. Instead, it centralizes decision‑making in Washington, D.C., sidelining the very people most affected by forest mismanagement. Idahoans know their landscapes best — yet the Fix Our Forests Act leaves them on the margins.
If Congress truly wants to protect lives and property, funding should prioritize home hardening and defensible space, not more logging projects. Research consistently shows that the most effective way to reduce wildfire losses is to make homes themselves more fire‑resistant and to create defensible zones around them.
Home Hardening: Fire‑resistant roofing, ember‑resistant vents, and non‑combustible siding dramatically reduce the chance of ignition.
Defensible Space: Clearing brush, spacing trees, and removing flammable materials within 30–100 feet of structures creates a buffer that slows fire spread and gives firefighters a chance to defend homes, and in combination with home hardening reduces the risk of home ignition by 50%.
Cost‑Effectiveness: Dollar for dollar, investments in home hardening and defensible space save more lives and property than large‑scale thinning projects miles away from communities.
The act fails to prioritize these proven strategies. Instead of pouring money into logging contracts — often removing the very fire‑resistant trees that stabilize forests — Congress should direct resources toward grants and programs that help homeowners, local governments, and tribes implement fire‑safe practices. Protecting communities where people actually live must come first.
The Fix Our Forests Act is a bad bill. By prioritizing logging interests, ignoring climate realities, and neglecting community safety, it risks worsening the backlog it claims to fix. Idaho’s forests, indeed all forests, and the people who live near them, deserve better. Real solutions lie not in more bureaucracy and timber contracts, but in climate‑smart management and investments in home hardening and defensible space. As climate change accelerates wildfire intensity and frequency, legislation that fails to confront this reality leaves communities dangerously exposed. Protecting lives and landscapes requires policies that meet the scale of the climate‑driven fire crisis head‑on. Anything less is a dangerous distraction.

You may or may not notice it as you travel along the Front Range, but the world’s digital infrastructure is rapidly taking root here.
 Warehouses full of hyper-efficient computers powering everything from email to artificial intelligence. Denver alone projects nearly a 200% increase in data center growth, while utilities like Xcel Energy warn they will need $22 billion in new infrastructure to meet the rising demand for electricity.

Some are calling the Interstate 25 corridor “Data Center Row.” Others see potential for jobs and an increased tax base. And many Coloradans are asking a reasonable question: What does all this development actually mean for our communities, our water, our climate, and our energy bills?
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
As a researcher who studies the political and environmental dimensions of emerging technologies, the reality is this: Data centers are reshaping Colorado’s environmental and economic landscape in real time, and we need smart, transparent policy to guide that growth.
The scale is new, and enormous
A single AI-oriented data center can use as much electricity as 175,000 homes. Colorado has more than 60 data centers already, most clustered along the Front Range. Dozens more facilities, some exceeding 160 megawatts of power capacity, are planned or under construction.
This growth isn’t happening in isolation. Two federal executive orders issued this year removed environmental guardrails and fast-tracked data center construction nationwide. Colorado, eager not to lose investment to competitors like Texas, Iowa and Wyoming, has responded with tax incentives and the proposed “Data Center Development and Grid Modernization Act,” which sought to trade subsidies for basic energy and water stewardship requirements.
But even with efficiency improvements, the sheer scale of AI adoption means electricity demand is rising steeply, and the 1970s-era infrastructure we have isn’t built for the capacity of demand. Xcel projects that by 2040, data centers alone could require 8.5 gigawatts of power, roughly the equivalent of adding another Denver metro area to the grid.
The environmental impact is complex
Data centers are frequently criticized for their significant water needs and potential to strain local utilities. And it’s true that some proposed facilities in Colorado could consume hundreds of thousands of gallons per day if they rely on conventional evaporative cooling, putting a significant strain on an already scarce regional water supply.
But some newer facilities are adopting lower-water or water-free cooling technologies, such as liquid cooling, adiabatic systems and air-side economization. Still, these technologies are not yet industry-wide, and the cumulative effects of rapid data center growth could place real pressure on Colorado’s limited water supplies.
Energy use is also a key concern. Data centers currently account for 4.4% of U.S. electricity demand, and with rapid AI growth, that number could triple within a few years. Utilities may pass infrastructure costs on to ratepayers. And Colorado’s grid is still far from fully decarbonized. More load without more clean energy risks prolonging fossil fuel reliance.
Social impacts
Communities across the country have pushed back on data center proposals because of noise, diesel backup generators, light pollution, and secrecy around energy and water use. Colorado is starting to see the same concerns, particularly concerning the 600,000 square-foot center under construction in Denver’s densely populated Elyria-Swansea neighborhood.
Transparency remains a major problem. Some companies claim that disclosing energy or water use gives competitors an edge, leaving neighbors and local governments in the dark. And local officials, eager for economic development, may grant tax breaks without fully understanding long-term costs: increased grid infrastructure needs, potential rate hikes and land-use tradeoffs.
Meanwhile, the jobs picture is mixed. Construction jobs are plentiful, but once built, even massive data centers often employ fewer than 100 workers.
What can Colorado do?
Data centers are not going away; they are the backbone of the growing digital economy. But without effective policy, we risk letting the industry set the terms. Colorado can lead nationally by pursuing three principles:

 Require full transparency on water, energy and emissions. Every data center should publicly report annual water use, cooling methods, electricity consumption and backup generator operations. Communities deserve to know what is being built in their backyard.
 Tie incentives to real climate commitments.
 • 100% clean electricity procurement
 • Water-efficient or water-free cooling technologies
 • Investments in grid modernization that don’t fall solely on ratepayers
Colorado’s recent attempt — SB-280 — moved in this direction before collapsing under pressure. It should be revived and strengthened.
 Plan for regional impacts, not project-by-project approvals.
A single data center is manageable. Dozens clustered together can reshape electricity demand, land use and noise levels for an entire region. Colorado needs coordinated regional planning to avoid the chaotic landscapes seen elsewhere.

The reality is, data centers are foundational to how we live in the world today, and more so in the future. We know how to build them better, with community input and more sustainable resource use. We should demand that the infrastructure powering AI and the broader digital economy operates within Colorado’s environmental limits and contributes to a livable, resilient future.
If we get this right, Colorado can be a national leader in responsible AI infrastructure. If we get it wrong, we’ll spend decades trying to retrofit the consequences.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Strange as it seems, the Democratic Party has a remarkable roster of candidates to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell next year.
Former state Rep. Charles Booker has run for senator twice before and been nominated once, and led his primary foes by 3 points in a mid-October poll.
Right behind him was Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot who gave the likeliest Republican nominee a tough, close race for his congressional seat seven years ago.
Far behind were Pam Stevenson, a retired Air Force colonel and minister who led her party caucus in the state House; Logan Forsythe, a Lexington lawyer and former Secret Service agent from West Kentucky; and Louisville businessman Joel Willett, a former CIA officer who has impressed party leaders.
After the poll was taken, horse trainer Dale Romans entered, with the sort of profile that could win the seat: a middle-roader like West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, backed by Democratic strategist James Carville, and the encouragement of Gov. Andy Beshear.
Kentucky is not on national pundits’ list of Senate seats that Democrats are supposed to have any chance of flipping, and Republicans consider the race “a sure-thing slam dunk,” as GOP strategist Tres Watson said last week.
But in the Donald Trump era, nothing is a sure thing. Though Trump is the main reason Republicans are confident, he’s also one reason Democrats think the Senate nomination is worth something. His national job ratings are about as low as they were just after Jan. 6, 2021, and are falling in Kentucky, which he won by 29 points. One recent poll had his net approval (positive minus negative) here at only 2 points; another had it at 14.
Trump’s doing better in Tennessee, but voters there gave Republicans a scare in a special congressional election this month. A moderate Democrat might have flipped the seat.
Republicans all over are starting to distance themselves from Trump, his behavior, his handling of the economy and his controversial appointees, but Kentucky’s three Republican candidates for senator are putting no distance between themselves and the president, since his endorsement in the race would likely be dispositive. But if his actions and those of his administration become much more objectionable, the Republican nominee could find himself in a disreputable ditch with an unpopular leader.
Among Republican candidates, former attorney general Daniel Cameron leads in polls, but 6th District Rep. Andy Barr is gaining and has a big fundraising advantage. Businessman Nate Morris trails, but has the best ties to Trump and is getting help from MAGA information channels unfavorable to Barr. Elizabethtown businessman Michael Faris is also seeking the GOP nomination.
All the major Democrats have assets and liabilities. Booker and Stevenson are unabashed liberals and African Americans in a  conservative state where racism still matters. McGrath lost credibility in 2020 when she out-raised McConnell and still lost to him by 20 points (after barely defeating Booker in a primary with unusual circumstances). Forsythe and Willett are unknown and will have trouble getting attention, but have overcome adversity before, and Willett has loaned his campaign $200,000.
Romans may have the most potential, pro and con. He is the most conservative Democrat, but still in the party mainstream on issues such as abortion, health care and immigration — about which he speaks knowledgeably; it’s an issue for the horse industry. But he paid a big fine for immigration violations over a decade ago, and has had other legal issues.
“I have not totally vetted him,” Carville said in an interview, “but I know his reputation in the industry is pretty solid.” Carville quit doing hired political work long ago, but still picks favorites and has promoted Romans. “If Democrats are gonna be competitive in places like Kentucky, we’re gonna need these kind of candidates,” he said. “I told him he can use my name; we need to encourage people like this to run as Democrats.”
Beshear encouraged him, Romans told the Paulick Report, a horse-industry publication: “The governor is a friend of mine and I talked to him about it before I ever decided to run. He said it was a good idea: ‘Get out there and run’ and that it was a very noble thing to do.”
Beshear would be Democrats’ best nominee, but a loss would greatly complicate his plan to run for president in 2028. Democrats are anxious to see if he will at last make good on his responsibility as party leader to recruit Democrats for legislative and local races.
State Democratic Party Executive Director Morgan Eaves said she expects more Democrats to run for the legislature than in 2024. Being in a lopsided minority is no fun, but she said potential candidates “are hearing from people in their communities the reality of the Republican agenda. … They understand that Republicans were once in the superminority too, and you’ve got to claw your way out, and they’ve got to be part of the solution.” The Senate race, at the top of the ticket, will matter.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Gov. Josh Shapiro is urging federal energy officials to consider comments from consumer advocates, state utility regulators and power companies before deciding a case that could determine how AI data centers and other large electricity users connect to the grid.
The Shapiro administration filed a motion Wednesday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) opposing a request to dismiss the case. It was made by groups representing electricity generators and Amazon, Google, Microsoft and other hyperscalers that plan to build data centers across the country.
“The commission must not take an extraordinary approach that would close the record before parties have an opportunity to be heard,” the filing by Shapiro’s Office of General Council says. ”It would be an error for the commission to deviate from its usual practice of assessing a complaint based on a fully developed record, particularly given the matters of such critical impact to affordable, reliable service throughout PJM.”

PJM Interconnection is the regional transmission organization that manages the electricity market and transmission for Pennsylvania, 12 other states from New Jersey to Illinois and the District of Columbia. The organization is in the midst of an expedited process to determine new rules to govern when data centers can connect to the grid. 
PJM’s independent market monitor proposed a set of rules that would bar data centers, which can consume as much power as a small city, from connecting unless there is sufficient generating and transmission capacity to serve them without blackouts affecting other customers.
The monitor, Market Analytics, a Pennsylvania company that serves a watchdog for PJM, filed a complaint with FERC last month asserting that its proposal – effectively a moratorium on new data centers – is the only way PJM can meet its mandate to protect reliable and affordable electricity access across its region.
The Data Center Coalition and PJM Power Providers Group argued the case should be dismissed on procedural grounds and that requiring stakeholders to submit briefs would be “a distraction and a waste of time when the industry and nation can least afford it.”
Data centers provide the computing power to train artificial intelligence. Proponents, including President Donald Trump, say improving AI is a matter of national security and cast it as a technological race with China.
Data center development across PJM’s territory has contributed to rising energy costs and peak demand that is forecast to grow by 20% over the next decade, according to PJM’s forecast.

Growing demand has already driven up the price that generating companies get for keeping power stations on standby to meet peak demands. Despite an agreement between the Shapiro administration and PJM capping prices until next year, energy costs for consumers have increased and are projected to continue rising. 
The Critical Issue Fast Track process PJM is using to determine new rules for data centers drew a dozen proposals that were presented and voted on by stakeholder groups at a meeting of the organization’s board of managers Nov. 19. Although the votes are only advisory for PJM’s board of managers, which will make the final decision, none reached the two-thirds majority threshold to be approved.
“The solutions offered by PJM and most stakeholders simply assume that PJM must agree to add large loads to the system when the loads cannot be served reliably,” Monitoring Analytics’ FERC complaint states.
The independent monitor argues PJM has the authority to make data centers wait, and in order to protect reliability and affordability, that is the only viable solution. 
Nearly 40 companies, government agencies and individuals have filed motions to intervene in the case. FERC has set a deadline Monday for comments.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_8692-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 05:57:04.660141

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger addressed the Virginia Press Association and contextualized key challenges she and legislators will face when she takes office in January. Addressing the state’s energy crisis is near the top of that list, as power demands ramp up largely due to the growth of high-powered data centers throughout the state.
Spanberger said she would be interested in revising the landmark Virginia Clean Economy Act to allow for an expansion of battery storage that allows for solar power to be dispatched hours after it is collected.
“Five years ago, when that bill was first passed, technology wasn’t where it is now. We have been employing in Virginia some energy storage infrastructure (but) certainly not nearly enough,” Spanberger said. “Having storage capacity will allow us to mitigate some of the ebbs and flows that can create, in some cases, brownouts.”
The state has seen more peak energy demand days. Dominion Energy saw 10 peak energy days this year reaching a total of 25 gigawatts of power being used at one time. They also have an estimated 47 gigawatts worth of data centers in the queue to be eventually energized, according to Scott Gaskill, vice president of regulatory affairs for Dominion. 
There are alternative energy sources but they aren’t all viable in the near term, the incoming governor said. Gas energy projects, such as the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, are projected to take at least five years to be built due to delays in getting gas turbines. Small Modular Reactors are about a decade away from coming online in a widespread way. Bolstering solar power is the fastest way to bring more power online to meet demand and keep costs from skyrocketing, Spanberger said.
“I support looking towards energy generation of the future, like SMRs, but we’re still 10-plus years away from that,” Spanberger said. “There’s benefit to renewable energy in that it can be realized much and certainly as someone working to lower costs – meet the moment and ensure that we’re generating enough energy. We will continue to need a mix of energy generation into the future.”
Virginia hospitals, clinics brace for federal health care changes

As the U.S. Senate deadlocked on a measure to extend the Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits Thursday — which, if they expire at the end of this month, will cause millions of Americans’ insurance premiums to skyrocket — Spanberger weighed in on how to tackle health care challenges in Virginia. 
Over 600,000 Virginians could lose Medicaid coverage and be subjected to new work requirements under a giant reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer. Spanberger said the state needs to position itself to help people complete their paperwork in time to prevent them from losing coverage.
“We have to put our full attention to making sure that we can verify people’s employment quickly, efficiently, effectively, so that people don’t fall through the cracks, essentially creating scaffolding that allows for Medicaid coverage to continue,” Spanberger said.
Virginia hospitals and health clinics, especially in rural areas, remain concerned about potential cuts to their staff or services. Experts estimate the health care facilities could take a $2 billion hit once the federal changes are implemented. 
Spanberger highlighted that the state does not have enough money to backfill the full loss of federal funding. 
The governor-elect also said that the federal funding bill changed how much money students can borrow. She said these limitations will have an impact on people who want to become medical professionals but may not be able to afford schooling. She said the state could consider loan repayment programs or other ways to help overcome the financial barriers to higher education.
“It’s a problem of (Congress’) kind of ill conceived creation that will have real significant impact if we don’t figure out a way to contend with it, or frankly, just put such broad pressure on Congress for them to pass a walk back to some of their worst ideas,” Spanberger said.

(Photo courtesy NBC12)More than half of Virginia’s schools are exceeding or meeting the state’s academic expectations and made gains in achievement, graduation rates, growth and readiness, according to data from the Virginia Department of Education on Wednesday.
Performance data presented to the Board of Education also showed that more schools met the state’s standards to be fully accredited based on 2024-25 data compared to the previous year.
Wednesday’s results come after a years-long effort by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration to address a “flawed” accreditation system to provide clear and more accurate student performance results.
“Our Student Performance and Support Framework is …providing timely, trustworthy data so we can target support to the students, schools and communities who need it most, and we can all learn from our Distinguished top-performing schools,” Youngkin said in a statement on social media. “This is how we prepare every student for success in life, whether they enroll in college, find employment in a great career, or enlist in our military.”
Since the beginning of Youngkin’s term in 2022, the agency has begun overhauling the accreditation system to improve overall clarity and transparency and deliver better, more actionable information, according to the agency.
Last year, the Board of Education opted to split the system, referred to as the state’s School Performance and Support Framework, into two for the current school year — assessing whether schools are meeting all state and federal regulations, and providing prompt and transparent information on school and student performance.
The data from the new accountability system shows that 66% of schools are exceeding or meeting state expectations for achievement, graduation, growth and readiness.
A total of 425 schools were identified as “distinguished” in the report, and 774 schools were labeled “on track.”
In addition, 399 schools were identified as “off track,”  while 213 schools were marked as “needs intensive support,” meaning they are not meeting any of the state’s expectations.
Agency data also stated that more than half of elementary schools demonstrated significant student growth in reading and math, and graduation rates remain stable compared to the last two school years. 
VDOE said the release was delayed to validate the results, which were conducted by Old Dominion University’s Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center. The “added step promotes transparency and reinforces confidence and trust in the final framework outcomes” before providing summaries to school divisions, the agency said.
“Our goal of transparency has seemingly been achieved here, and it’s not just transparency for ‘gotcha,’ it’s transparency for growth, transparency for continuous improvement,” said Board President Grace Creasey, who was appointed by Youngkin, on Wednesday.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson congratulated the team on their work and said she looks forward to seeing how the results will help students.
“I am just so excited about what this means and possibility for every student,” Gullickson said.
Accreditation data showed that 94% of schools were fully accredited in 2024-25, compared to 85% in 2024-25.
“I’m excited… to have such clarity on what it means to become accredited,” said Board Member Beth Ackerman, a Youngkin appointee, at the board’s work session on Wednesday. However, she cautioned the department against relying solely on self-assessments and encouraged the inclusion of third-party reviews to strengthen the system.
A total of 113 schools, or 6%, received “conditionally accredited” designations, primarily due to missing or insufficient documentation by school divisions — not operational breakdowns. Staff said the process highlighted the need for clearer guidance and more standardized submission practices.
In addition, six schools were given “new school” designations for newly configured schools. No school was denied accreditation.
Erin Madden, VDOE senior program and strategy specialist, said the conditionally accredited status is not punitive but an opportunity for improvement, with the goal of achieving “everyone 100% accredited.”

Stormwater runoff has become part of a growing, contentious debate around solar energy development in Virginia.
Some residents and officials in rural areas complain of flooding and pollution around large solar sites. Developers argue that there are already requirements in place to mitigate the problem.
Virginia Tech is in the midst of an effort to collect on-the-ground data to help inform state leaders how to move forward.
The Department of Environmental Quality gave the school $6 million for a six-year study. About two years in, the research team recently published initial findings.
“What we found is, these areas that have solar development happening tend to produce runoff more quickly,” said Ryan Stewart, associate professor at Virginia Tech’s School of Plant and Environmental Sciences. “In many cases, though not all cases, we tend to see higher peak flows coming off the solar areas.”
Stormwater runoff happens when rain falls on impervious surfaces, such as roadways and parking lots, which do not absorb water. That can cause flooding, contribute to erosion and allow pollutants to wash into waterways.
Utility-scale solar projects in Virginia are often built on former farmland, which absorbs water. But glass panels on top allow water to run off.
What happens next “is kind of an open question,” Stewart said.
Some people believe that when the water falls from below the panels, it keeps flowing, eventually running off the site. Others argue that once the water drips off, it infiltrates into the soil beneath adjoining panels downhill.
His team measured runoff at three utility-scale solar sites, one in Surry County and two in the Piedmont region, each spanning hundreds of acres.
Researchers installed metal structures, called flumes, in the channels lining the solar sites to monitor water flow during storms.
The devices are hooked up to data loggers with cellular connections that upload data to the cloud every 30 minutes, along with rainfall data from local weather stations.
For comparison, the group measured runoff at reference points around the solar sites, such as grass or cropland, to represent their previous land use.

Between January 2024 and October 2025, the group recorded between 39 and 76 storms at each site, most with less than an inch of rain accumulation.
The results showed that the spots within solar arrays often saw “rapid, and at times substantial,” amounts of surface runoff.
“I think that points out that solar development is having an effect on hydrology,” Stewart said. “We can’t just assume that the landscape is how it was before the solar construction.”
Last year, Virginia Tech published research on how to best manage land while building and decommissioning utility-scale solar sites. The paper states such facilities could impact 350,000 acres of the state’s agricultural and forested landscapes by 2045.
Recommendations included using conservative estimates for potential runoff, using sensors to trigger panels to move into vertical positions during heavy rainfall and minimizing the removal of topsoil.
Solar developers are required to address stormwater runoff, often using constructed ditches or retention ponds to store water, which then evaporates or slowly trickles into soil and streams.
Much of the regulatory debate comes down to a technical definition. The state previously considered only the foundations of solar panels to be impervious surfaces.
But Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration rolled out changes to classify panels as 100% impervious, saying stronger standards were needed to stem pollution in the heavily regulated Chesapeake Bay watershed.
The change “has caused a lot of consternation among some of the developers who think that’s overkill,” Stewart said. “That’s something we hope to get a better handle on through this project: What’s actually happening with water that’s coming off the panels.”
The Virginia Tech researchers plan to gather more information in the remaining years of the project, such as expanding to six sites, figuring out what the runoff contains and any changes to the soil itself.
Stewart said he’s mindful of the “strong interest on both sides.”
“We’re just trying to collect information in the best way we can and analyze it in a transparent way,” he said. “So that everybody involved can take a look and see this is actually what’s going on, versus what we assume or hope is happening.”

(Screenshot)Lindsay Lang’s morning doomscroll has become something of a compulsion.
As she gets out of bed, the HealthSource RI director can’t help but reach for her phone, combing through news headlines and social media feeds in case there’s an update on the federal tax credits for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The pandemic-era discounts are set to expire at the end of the year. Without them, monthly premiums will double, from $109 to $220 a month on average, for the 48,000 Rhode Islanders covered through the state insurance marketplace, according to a state analysis. 
HealthSource RI estimates 13,000 current enrollees will drop coverage when federal tax credits expire at the end of the year because of the increased cost.
Unless Congress can agree to extend the subsidies — breaking the monthslong stalemate that was a driving force behind the 43-day federal shutdown.
Lang isn’t hopeful.
But, “things have changed on a dime before” she said in an interview Thursday.
Rhode Islanders are also watching Congress with a close eye ahead of the looming deadline to start or continue health insurance coverage through the state marketplace.
Preliminary information published on Dec. 5 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services suggests that participation in individual marketplace health insurance plans remains on par with prior years: nationwide, 4.8 million consumers have returned, joined by 950,000 new enrollees.
In Rhode Island, more than 2,700 people signed up for marketplace health insurance for the first time, while over 41,000 existing participants returned, according to federal data.
Lang doesn’t put much stock in the CMS report, at least for returning customers, because they were automatically renewed for coverage at the start of open enrollment on Nov. 1.   
“It’s really hard to know where we’ll land until after that first payment deadline,” Lang said. 
Lang felt more confident about the staying power of those who just signed up.
“It’s safe to consider new enrollment folks are a bit more active shoppers,” she said. “They haven’t received the federal subsidy before.”
Going for bronze 
Among new participants, more are choosing less expansive — and expensive — coverage. More than 1 in 4 new enrollees have chosen a “bronze” medal health plan, which has the lowest premium of the four tiers, but typically much higher deductibles and fewer services covered. By contrast, 16% of participants who signed up in 2025 chose bronze medal plans, while nearly one-third opted for gold medal plans — the second-highest coverage. 
Lang expected returning customers would also choose to downgrade their coverage from platinum or gold medal plans to silver or bronze, although data was not available.
HealthSource RI sent out invoices to new and returning plan participants last week. Most have not made payments or put a credit card on file yet. 
But they are asking questions, flooding the phone lines of the East Providence call center and quickly filling the virtual enrollment time slots to try and comprehend why their health insurance costs so much more.
“We’re definitely having conversations about shock, concern, needing more time to process this information,” Lang said. “People are asking ‘is this number I’m seeing in my renewal notice right? Is there anything I can do to change it?’”
No longer able to tout the state insurance marketplace as affordable, Lang and her team have instead shifted their messaging to the importance of maintaining health insurance coverage.










We’re definitely having conversations about shock, concern, needing more time to process this information. People are asking ‘is this number I’m seeing in my renewal notice right? Is there anything I can do to change it?’


– Lindsay Lang, HealthSource RI director


As of October 2024, Rhode Island boasted the sixth-highest insured rate of any state in the country, with nearly 98% of residents covered. Returning to pre-Affordable Care Act days, when more than 11% of the state population lacked any form of health insurance, could have dire consequences.
In 2024, Rhode Island hospitals provided more than $84 million in uncompensated care for people without insurance, according to the Hospital Association of Rhode Island.  The trade group representing Rhode Island hospitals warned in a Dec. 8 statement that “even a fraction” of newly uninsured people heading to emergency rooms, inpatient units or outpatient clinics will cause hospital costs to climb sharply, jeopardizing their financial stability and service.
Younger and healthier people are most likely to drop coverage, leaving a pool of older, sicker and more medically expensive enrollees for commercial health insurers to cover. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, the two insurers that cover marketplace enrollees, sought record high premium increases partly because of the company expenses associated with covering a riskier pool of plan participants. 
D.C. stalemate 
“It’s driving up costs for everyone, no matter where they get their care,” U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo said in a Dec. 3 statement, following a virtual town hall with Lang. 
Amo, like the rest of Rhode Island’s Democratic congressional delegation, has placed blame squarely on congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump for further straining the health care system.
“If Republicans in Congress refuse to act, people in their states aren’t going to be able to afford coverage,” U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement on Dec. 10. “And without coverage, the sad fact is some will not survive. So I hope my Republican colleagues will listen to their constituents and act in their best interests.”
The U.S. Senate failed to pass competing health care bills Thursday, Reed and U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse voted for the Democratic bill, which would have extended the federal tax credits for three years, and against the Republican bill, which would add funding to Health Savings Accounts for marketplace enrollees.
“Today’s vote is just one more data point showing the American people that Republicans are inexplicably hostile to their own constituents having high-quality health care,” Whitehouse said in a statement.
Peter Marino, CEO and president for Neighborhood Health, also expressed disappointment in the congressional stalemate.
“This inaction has real consequences: thousands of Rhode Islanders who relied on these credits as a lifeline to affordable health care coverage may now face the unthinkable choice of going without coverage for themselves and their families,” Marino said in a statement Thursday. “Despite today’s setback, Neighborhood remains steadfast in our mission to advocate for accessible, cost-effective, and equitable health care for every member we serve. ”
Reed also pledged to continue pushing for the federal tax credits.
“The tricky part is, there’s a lot of talk but just a few actual proposals out there,” Lang said.
Also challenging: planning for the local impact of eleventh hour federal actions. If Congress extends the tax credits, or reconfigures them, Lang’s 16-person team would have to recalculate monthly premium costs, giving existing or prospective enrollees the option to enroll, renew or change plans. 
It might also affect the commercial insurance rates approved by Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King, who granted increases for 2026 commercial premiums due in part to expiring federal tax credits.
“If we can lower the rates, we’d want to lower the rates,” King said in an interview with Rhode Island Current at the start of open enrollment in November. “And do it as quickly as humanly possible.”

President and CEO Andrew Marsh at Google's formal announcement of a $4 billion data center project on Oct. 2, 2025. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate) FOMO has broken out across Arkansas, as elected officials, unelected economic developers, utility companies and their regulators fall all over themselves not to miss out on the AI-fueled data center boom, a competition characterized by hyperbole, secrecy and healthy doses of wishful thinking.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and state legislators are fueling the campaign to turn Arkansas into a mecca for data centers, expanding a sales tax exemption for new projects and allowing Entergy Arkansas and other utilities to bill consumers for the expanded generating capacity needed to satiate data centers’ voracious appetite for electricity.
Yet, amid splashy announcements of projects, sort-of projects and maybe someday projects, and the handing out of tax breaks like a freewheeling Santa on Christmas Eve, some pesky questions are being ignored.
Do the relatively modest number of jobs generated by data centers justify the infrastructure improvements and tax breaks being offered to lure them to Arkansas? Is it fair for power customers who live far afield from data centers to foot the bill for expanding capacity?
Is it appropriate or wise for state and local governments to provide corporate welfare subsidies to some of the most profitable companies on the planet — and to negotiate those deals in secret to avoid appropriate public scrutiny? Is opening up the candy store really necessary to compete for these projects, or are state and local leaders — driven by their fear of missing out — getting played?
As we try to move away from our reliance on fossil fuels to combat climate change, should we really be encouraging environmentally unfriendly projects that undermine our renewable energy goals by driving up electricity demand beyond what renewable sources can possibly supply?
And, more basically, is indulging FOMO a responsible way to make decisions that could alter the state’s landscape, raise our electric bills and shackle state and local governments to tax incentives for decades to come?
The AI boom has led to exponential growth in the number of data centers sprouting up across the country, as high-tech behemoths such as Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft look to ramp up their server capacity. The number of U.S. data centers now tops 4,200, just nine of which are in Arkansas.
But the past year has seen a proliferation of projects across the state — a $4 billion Google data center in West Memphis and vague proposals for $1 billion data centers in Little Rock, Conway and Clarksville. Although Google is rumored to be behind all three of these projects, middlemen are being used to negotiate tax breaks, so the names remain a secret.
Of course, state and local governments offering tax breaks and infrastructure improvements to lure new businesses is nothing new — the entire economic development industry is built around the practice. The traditional justification is that the new facility will generate a large number of jobs that will provide stable long-term employment for local residents.
While that argument might hold water when it comes to a new factory or assembly plant, it falls flat with data centers — facilities with gigantic footprints that consume copious amounts of electricity and water but provide relatively few jobs.
For example, the prospective data centers in Little Rock and Conway would occupy 300,000 square feet — more than five football fields — but employ just 50 people, about as many as would be in a modest-sized high school marching band. Google’s center in West Memphis will have just 300 permanent employees, on a campus of 1,100 acres, although it’s projected to provide 5,000 temporary jobs during construction.
And companies operating data centers have also been loath to guarantee that even these modest numbers of jobs will go to locals; indeed, some of the more high-paying technical jobs are likely to go to outsiders with specialized skills.
Republicans in the legislature called their bill allowing utility infrastructure costs to be passed along to consumers the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act. But how many jobs? For whom? At what cost?
While the impact on employment may be modest, data centers’ effect on the power supply is not. Electricity demand for data centers is forecast to triple by 2028,  from 4% of total U.S. demand to 12%. And an analysis from the Harvard Electricity Law Initiative found that this alliance between utilities and Big Tech will shift billions in costs onto the shoulders of consumers, a trend we’re seeing already in Arkansas.
Entergy Arkansas customers, from Texarkana to Pocahontas and points in between, are going to pay on average $2 more per month to finance increased generating capacity to serve Google’s data center in West Memphis, under an agreement approved earlier this month by the Public Service Commission. Thus, customers who won’t receive economic benefit from this project will be paying to subsidize it.
A study from the University of Michigan also found that data center owners often negotiate sweetheart deals with utility companies for discounted rates, further shifting costs to consumers — and details of those deals are often kept secret.
We’ve also seen that in Arkansas:  When Entergy presented details of its contract with Google to the PSC, the public was ordered to leave the hearing room so that “confidential” information could be discussed in secret.
The secrecy around data center recruitment is a feature, not a bug. And the primary beneficiaries are the tech companies who get public subsidies and discounted utility rates without subjecting themselves to the transparency or accountability we should expect in what’s left of our democracy.
If we want to see where all of this might lead, we might look to Virginia, which has been inundated with more than 660 data centers and where FOMO is giving way to regret.
Officials there are getting an earful from voters mad about noise and environmental impacts, higher utility rates and a paucity of new jobs. Legislation has been introduced to prevent utilities from passing along data center infrastructure costs to consumers. And a Democrat recently flipped a legislative seat that had been in Republican hands for decades by stressing the effect data centers were having on electricity prices.
As a Republican state senator put it, “People are now looking at this, going, ‘What the hell is going on?’”
Which of course, is the irony of FOMO: Sometimes missing out is really in your best interest.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA021854-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-12 05:57:04.660141

Ohio Senate Bill 56 is on its way to DeWine after Ohio Senate Republicans passed the bill Tuesday. The Ohio House passed the bill last month after it went to conference committee.

Ohio’s bill complies with recent federal changes by banning intoxicating hemp products from being sold outside of a licensed marijuana dispensary. If DeWine signs the bill into law before the new year, the ban could take effect as soon as March.
“This bill is going to put businesses like me and families like me out of business,” said Ahmad Khalil, one of the owners of Hippie Hut Smoke Shop, with locations in Ohio and Washington. 
“Overnight, we’re going to see tens of thousands of people directly impacted, which will ripple effect into 50,000 of families that are also dependent on this person.”
Khalil has been in the hemp industry for nine years.

“This was my American dream, so to see it get taken away from you, kind of hurts,” he said. 
Jason Friedman, owner of Ohio CBD Guy in Cincinnati, said this is extremely frustrating. 
“My tentative plan will involve eventually closing my East Walnut Hills location resulting in less hours and likely loss of jobs for some of my employees,” he said. 
Instead of a ban, Friedman wants regulations for the hemp industry such as age-gating, packaging restrictions, and testing requirements.
“For the state to say that they are changing their stance to banning from regulating because of what the federal government has done in banning intoxicating hemp in the recent spending bill, makes no sense because marijuana has been illegal federally the whole time,” he said. 
Mark Fashian, president of hemp product wholesaler Midwest Analytical Solutions in Delaware, Ohio, said this will put him, and hundreds of others out of business, if this becomes law. 
He works with more than 500 stores around Ohio that sell intoxicating hemp products. 
“It’s just despicable what (the lawmakers have) done,” he said. “It’s actually slowed my business down a lot because a lot of companies are now afraid to buy products because they don’t know what tomorrow will bring.” 
The intoxicating hemp ban has nothing to do with protecting children, Fashian said. 
“If we want to protect children, make it 21 and over,” he said. “If there is an increase in kids getting hold of this stuff it’s because mom and dad are pretty careless and leave it on the kitchen table, and the kids grab it from them.” 
Fashian said he expects lawsuits if the bill is signed into law. 
Kim Bryant, a salesperson at Your CBD Store Marion, said these products help people with their anxiety, sleep, and pain management. 
“It’s very sad to me,” she said. “This product helps so many people.” 
Bryant said the average age of their customer is 50 years old and she does not think they will want to go to a marijuana dispensary. 
The bill also allows five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed, and sold until Dec. 31, 2026. 
Marijuana 
Ohio S.B. 56 also makes changes to the state’s marijuana law. 
It would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
The bill prohibits possessing marijuana in anything outside of its original packaging and requires drivers to store marijuana in the trunk of their car while driving. 
“This is a re-criminalization bill,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
“Civil protections for cannabis consumers were stripped for absolutely zero justification offered is incredibly disappointing,” Fox said. 
Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon, Washington, and Washington, D.C. require marijuana to be transported in a sealed package and/or in the trunk of  a car, Fox said. 
“I fear that what we will see in Ohio is an emphasis on enforcement combined with little to no consumer education on the part of the state,” he said. “People might think they’re in complete compliance, but yet are engaging in activity that could lead to prosecutions.” 
A similar law in Illinois has kept marijuana-related arrests high post-legalization with 6,944 arrests in 2024, according to NORML. 
The bill also criminalizes bringing legal marijuana from another state back to Ohio. 
“To the best of my knowledge, no other state other than Ohio explicitly bans possession of cannabis that did not originate in the state,” Fox said. 
He said is disappointed, but not surprised.  
“(Ohio lawmakers) have been trying to weaken the voter approved law and laws surrounding protections for cannabis consumers since after voters approved Issue Two,” he said. “(This) absolutely goes against the will of the voters.” 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote. Sales started in August 2024 and exceeded $702.5 million in the first year. 
The Ohio Cannabis Coalition is happy lawmakers voted to ban intoxicating hemp products and give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries.
“Ohio is taking decisive action to protect families and demonstrate leadership as one of the first states in the nation to act since the closure of the Farm Bill loophole,” OHCANN Executive Director David Bowling said. “These tax dollars are an important way the cannabis industry benefits the communities where they live and operate.”

Craig Benson (back right) addresses the New Hampshire Commission on Government Efficiency (COGE) at its inaugural meeting Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)It was one of Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s earliest priorities this year: A “Commission on Government Efficiency” that would review ways to reduce cost and waste in the New Hampshire government and whose acronym, COGE, bore a striking resemblance to DOGE, the controversial federal effort led by Elon Musk. 
Now, 10 months after the governor first introduced the concept, that commission has delivered to Ayotte its first report. 
The final 77-page document, created mostly out of the public eye by a team led by former Republican Gov. Craig Benson and former AutoFair Automotive Group CEO Andy Crews, includes suggestions for both basic and transformative changes. Here are some of the report’s major recommendations. 
A splintering of Health and Human Services?
One idea in the COGE report would be a major change: the breaking up of the state Department of Health and Human Services. 
The report calls for “a careful, data-driven evaluation” to determine whether the department should be split into smaller agencies. Currently, the agency oversees a number of areas that include child protective services, mental health care, public health, and Medicaid and Medicare services. That wide-ranging mandate has caused Health and Human Services to grow into a “behemoth agency” that makes accountability difficult, the report argues. 
“The scale of its operations can obscure performance, complicate oversight, and slow decision-making,” the report states. “In some areas, divisions have grown large enough to function as stand-alone agencies in all but name, each with its own administrative structure, management layers, and reporting processes.” 
The report argues that to be effective, the split should result in a reduction of bureaucracy, not an increase. “Smaller agencies could set clearer goals, benchmark progress, and identify inefficiencies more quickly,” the report states.
COGE includes a number of other ideas for streamlining health care. The report argues Health and Human Services should increase its efforts to find fraud within the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and stand up an automated verification system for Medicaid enrollment.
Embracing AI
The COGE report says artificial intelligence could be an asset to the state — if used correctly. 
The best use case, COGE argued, is to help automate routine tasks. That could include summarizing regulatory documents, sorting correspondence, and flagging duplications. It could also help to verify information by using databases and to detect anomalies that could indicate fraud.
“The goal is to use technology to handle time-consuming, repetitive, or highly administrative tasks so that state workers can focus their time and expertise on work that requires human judgment, compassion, and decision making,” the report states. 
That approach requires human input, the report notes: “These pilots should be designed with clear objectives, human oversight, and measurable outcomes such as time saved, backlogs reduced, or improved citizen response times.”
The report also recommends the use of AI chat assistants. “These tools can safely respond to basic inquiries, such as providing office hours, directing citizens to forms, or checking the status of simple requests,” the report states. 
Beyond AI, the report suggests creating a statewide system to manage constituent interactions, allowing departments to better share information about residents’ concern and problems. 
Workplace overhauls
The report recommended the state end remote work options and move fully to in-person work in order to support teamwork.
Some recommendations call for new programs to improve the state’s workforce. The report recommends that state agencies increase externship opportunities for state university and community college students to allow more hands-on experiences. And it suggests building partnerships between community colleges and trade schools and the state’s Department of Corrections to provide more work training for inmates.
Other work-related suggestions are focused on reducing costs. The report asks state departments to conduct a “top-to-bottom review” of management-to-staff ratios. It also urges them to post job openings “at their original classification and pay level,” and not post the salaries of departing employees.
COGE called on the University System of New Hampshire to catalog administrative roles that are redundant and could be eliminated, and it said state agencies should conduct a similar review of public information officers.
It also said state agencies should look into ways to streamline legal services, perhaps by eliminating in-house attorneys in favor of support from the Department of Justice. 
Reducing state oversight boards
Two recommendations centered on state boards. The report said the state Office of Professional Licensure and Certification should consider keeping the “largest and most complex” boards as governing entities, but converting smaller boards to advisory panels.
And it said lawmakers should look into easing some of the professional requirements for serving on a state board, to favor experience over educational attainment or credential achievement.
Tighter controls over indigent defense, right-to-know requests
In a suggestion that echoed efforts on the Executive Council, COGE suggested creating a centralized system for courts to evaluate applications for indigent defense counsel. 
In October, Republican Councilor John Stephen of Manchester led a move to hold up reimbursing the state’s Judicial Council for $5.5 million of funding, arguing that more controls are needed to confirm eligibility. Weeks later, the council approved $1.5 million of that reimbursement — about a quarter of the Judicial Council’s request — with Stephen saying the rest of the money would be contingent on the creation of a verification system.
The COGE report agreed with that suggestion, stating that the judicial branch should create a “centralized clearing system” using standardized criteria to determine income eligibility.
COGE also suggested the state should change its laws to only require indigent defense counsel be provided to defendants whose charges could result in jail time, and not just a misdemeanor or fine, in order to reduce costs. That would peg the state’s policy to the minimum required indigent defense level established by the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Argersinger v. Hamlin. 
One recommendation by COGE would reduce Executive Council oversight, however. The report calls on the Legislature to consider raising the spending threshold for state contracts to require council approval; currently that threshold is $10,000, meaning the council has a number of opportunities to block funding or ask questions.
And the report urges a change to the way agencies process right-to-know requests: COGE suggests prioritizing records requests from New Hampshire residents and organizations over those based out of state.
Infrastructure efficiencies
Large portions of the COGE report mention the need for state departments to reduce waste. In some cases, that means auditing state-owned properties to determine which ones are underused and could be sold off. 
In other cases, COGE has called on departments to adopt collective standards for vehicle fleets, and to possibly pool vehicles across multiple agencies. The report recommends reviewing “who genuinely requires access to a State vehicle.” 
The report says more reviews should be taken to reduce energy costs and HVAC optimization. 
And it calls for the Department of Transportation to take over management of the state’s ports and harbors from the State Port Authority in order to expand access to federal grants and pursue a better transportation strategy that could boost state revenue.
Uncertain future
The report immediately drew praise from Ayotte. But it is not clear how many of the recommendations might be quickly implemented. Some could be achieved through executive order, but many would require comprehensive legislation. For lawmakers, the filing period for 2026 legislation has passed, but there are some mechanisms to introduce late legislation. 
Nonetheless, Ayotte said she would begin sifting through the suggestions and determine which she might push for. 
“This was done the New Hampshire way, with contributions from Commissioners, state employees, and members of the public who shared their input and ideas,” Ayotte said. “This report shows that when we focus on making operations better, we can deliver more value for taxpayers and build a more modern, efficient, and responsive government for all of New Hampshire.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2797-COGE-1024x622.jpg,,,2025-12-12 05:57:04.660141

(Photo Courtesy of ACLU of Idaho)Immigration arrests under the Trump administration continued to increase through mid-October, reaching rates of more than 30,000 a month. But, rather than the convicted criminals the administration has said it’s focused on, an ever-larger share of those arrests were for solely immigration violations.
In 45 states, immigration arrests more than doubled compared with the same period last year, during the Biden administration. The largest increases: There were 1,190 arrests in the District of Columbia compared with just seven last year under the Biden administration. Arrests were also more than five times higher in New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon and Virginia.
“The result stands in contrast to the administration’s objective of arresting the ‘worst of the worst,’” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Heightened enforcement is likely increasing “collateral” arrests of people found during searches for convicted criminals, he said.
More industries want Trump’s help hiring immigrant labor after farms get a break

Comparisons between the Trump and Biden administrations were calculated by Stateline in an analysis of data released by the Deportation Data Project, a research initiative by the universities of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles. About 93% of arrests could be identified by state.
While more people were arrested this year, a lower percentage are convicted criminals.
The share of arrested immigrants who had been convicted of violent crimes has dropped from 9% in January to less than 5% in October. The share under Biden was consistently between 10% and 11% during the same period in 2024.
The same trend applies to people arrested solely on immigration violations: Immigration violations alone were behind 20% in April, then rose to 44% of arrests in October, according to Stateline’s analysis.
In some states and the District of Columbia, a majority of arrests were for immigration violations alone: the District of Columbia (80%), New York (61%), Virginia (57%), Illinois (53%), West Virginia (51%) and Maryland (50%).
States with high immigrant populations also saw the most arrests this year. The largest numeric increases were in Texas (up 29,403, triple last year’s figure), Florida (up 14,693, a fourfold increase) and California (up 13,345, a fourfold increase).
The two states with the largest arrest rate increases have responded very differently to President Donald Trump’s deportation mission.
“We’re going to resist like all of the Democratic states,” New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in an interview with The Santa Fe New Mexican after last year’s election, referring to mass deportation plans. She proposed legislation to ban U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities in the state. The legislation failed this year, but Lujan Grisham urged the state legislature to reconsider next year. The state has three privately run ICE detention centers with the capacity for 2,000 people.
Idaho’s Republican governor, Brad Little, is helping ICE under a 287(g) agreement by transporting what his office calls “highly dangerous illegal alien criminals” from county jails to federal custody. The 53 men pictured on the governor’s website have charges ranging from drug possession to sexual assault.
In a news release, the office says the program is intended to take people “after the completion of their sentences,” though an October review by the Idaho Capital Sun found some were transported despite dismissed or still-pending charges.
Trump allows more foreign ag workers, eases off ICE raids on farms

Nationally, arrests have increased this year from around 17,000 in February, the first full month of President Donald Trump’s current term, to more than 30,000 in September and October. The share of convicted criminals has dropped from 46% to 30%, though the number of convicted criminals arrested still has been higher each month than under President Joe Biden.
Some of the policies that have fed increased arrest numbers face new court battles. This month, a federal judge blocked the administration from making immigration arrests in the District of Columbia without warrants or probable cause.
In August, a federal court blocked the administration’s expansion of expedited removal, which itself allows fast deportations without judicial review. The administration has appealed, arguing that immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years without legal authorization are not guaranteed due process.
Such fast deportations could be used on 2.5 million people, according to a Migration Policy Institute estimate published in September, including 1 million people released at the border with Mexico with court dates and 1.5 million people with temporary protections such as humanitarian parole.
This fall, the share of arrested immigrants with criminal convictions continued to decrease just before and during the federal government shutdown, with only 3% of those arrested having convictions between Sept. 21 and Nov. 16, according to national information analyzed by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a data research organization at Syracuse University.
“While ICE is detaining more and more individuals, targeting has shifted sharply to individuals without any criminal convictions,” the TRAC report noted.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/12/analysis-shows-ct-ready-for-next-recession-as-never-before/,A new forecast from Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration projects a moderate downturn wouldn’t drain state reserves for two and a half years.,"As fears of a recession grow, Connecticut’s finances enjoy unprecedented protection, with one new forecast from Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration projecting a moderate downturn wouldn’t even drain the state’s reserves for two and a half years.
Connecticut’s record-setting $4.3 billion rainy day fund, which represents 18% of annual operating expenses, is more than double the financial safety wall the state built just prior to the Great Recession of 2007-09 — an economic slump that drained all reserves, left the state with $1 billion in operating debt, and triggered at least one of the largest tax hikes in state history.
“Make no doubt about it, today Connecticut’s fiscal health is the strongest it has been in decades,” Lamont said this week. “And that is due to the responsible budgetary decisions we’ve been making over these last several years.”
Lamont was talking about how the state’s savings habits have helped eliminate billions of dollars of the massive pension debt Connecticut accumulated across seven decades prior to 2011 — a burden that still exceeds $33 billion.
But the administration says those same savings habits, which generated yearly budget surpluses averaging $1.8 billion since 2017, also completely rebuilt Connecticut’s chief defense against a sharp economic downturn.
The governor’s comments come as fears of a looming recession grow. 
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics — the research arm of a major Wall Street credit-rating agency — told Fortune magazine the country is on the precipice of a recession with too many households living paycheck-to-paycheck, job growth softening and tariffs ordered by President Donald Trump staggering the economy.
On Thursday, Connecticut Department of Labor Commissioner Danté Bartolomeo released the September labor situation report. While the state’s unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.8%, September payrolls declined by an estimated 5,700 jobs and the labor force declined by 5,400. In August, total jobs reached a 17-year high and private sector jobs were at an all-time high. (The September report is normally released in early October, but it was delayed due to the federal government shutdown.)
Bartolomeo didn’t discuss a recession Wednesday but she said the decline in jobs in the state followed a national trend.
A recession typically triggers a sharp drop in tax revenues that can last for several years. States typically respond by drawing down their rainy day funds, hoping to delay program cuts and tax hikes for as long as possible to shield residents and businesses already beset by a weak economy.
Connecticut’s budget reserve held just $212 million eight years ago, a meager cushion equal to 1% of annual operating expenses. Today, Connecticut’s fund ranks in the top tier among states, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.
According to a new recession “stress test” ordered by legislators and released recently by Lamont’s budget staff, a “mild” recession like the 2001 downturn triggered by overvaluation of internet companies wouldn’t even exhaust Connecticut’s reserves. The rainy day fund would shrink from $4.3 billion now to $1.4 billion before the hypothetical downturn ends in 2029.
An average or “moderate” recession would empty the rainy day fund by 2029.
Even a “severe” slump like The Great Recession of 2007-09 wouldn’t exhaust Connecticut’s reserves this fiscal year or next, though the state would slip about $800 million into the red by 2028. The state would end the recession owing about $4.5 billion, which represents 19% of the pre-recession General Fund.
At first glance, that’s worse than the $1 billion in operating debt — about 6% of the pre-recession General Fund — that Connecticut ran up during the 2007-09 slump.
But it’s not a fair comparison.
The administration’s “stress test” analysis doesn’t assume any savings from program cuts legislators likely would employ during the next recession, as they did in 2007-09, to mitigate operating debt.
Gov. M. Jodi Rell and the 2009 General Assembly also ordered tax hikes worth almost $620 million per year to avoid more debt. Prior to the 2007-09 recession, state officials had built a $1.4 billion rainy day fund equal to just 8.5% of operating expenses — less than half the reserve Connecticut has now.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who succeeded Rell in January 2011, inherited a budget on pace to run a record-setting 18% in deficit unless adjustments were made. He and the General Assembly then approved a tax hike estimated at more than $1.8 billion a year, one of the largest in state history.
Lamont’s “stress test” assumes no tax hikes are ordered during the next recession.
Officials from both parties praised the new analysis.
“I think that points out how much has actually been done,” to avoid fiscal mistakes of past, said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee.
She added Connecticut’s pensions for state employees and municipal teachers also have been strengthened considerably since 2020 by the transfer of more than $10 billion in budget surpluses into these retirement benefit programs. These deposits also will protect state finances during the next economic slump, when earnings from pension investments usually drop and states are required to deposit more funds.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said that while both parties voted for the 2017 budget caps that prepared Connecticut for the next recession, she fears majority Democratic legislators have forgotten Connecticut’s history.
Democrats in recent years have forfeited hundreds of millions of additional surplus dollars by not properly funding Medicaid programs and by creating a new fund — outside of the formal budget and spending cap — to bolster affordable child care.
“We need to make sure we’re ready for what comes,” Nuccio added. “We don’t want to be the Connecticut of the 2010s. … It was not a great time for us.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said legislators have struck a careful balance between preparing for economic slumps, paying down pension debt, and preserving core programs like health care, child care and education, even as President Trump and Congress shrink federal aid to states.
“The idea of putting away money for a rainy day is a positive thing,” Ritter said. “But also, you’ve got needs now.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_BudgetDay_0951-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-12 05:57:04.660141

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)As a family physician, I work every day to earn the trust of my patients. I see lines being blurred between politics and medicine and, despite the high trust the public has in their own physician, it is becoming harder to separate medical and scientific information from misinformation.
I hear this concern from my patients, particularly when trusted resources, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, make drastic policy shifts: Is this science based decision-making or politics?
 Who do you trust?
With every new patient I see, I share my approach to care by saying “I work for you. In many ways, you are my boss. My job is the make assessments and recommendations, yours is to make decisions, and I’m here to help you with that. How does that sound to you?”
People universally embrace this approach. It promotes individual autonomy and shifts the power to the patient — where it belongs. National surveys reveal that trust in government agencies such as the CDC is at an all time low, on par with approval ratings for Congress. However, trust in one’s own personal physician remains very high, with nearly 8 in 10 people rating their personal doctors as “very good” or “excellent,” according to a recent People’s Voices Survey.
Despite this relatively high trust the public has in their own doctors, the insertion of politics into the exam room has made it harder for people to make the right decisions for themselves by infecting the relationship between people and their doctors with misinformation, causing people to second guess recommendations they are receiving.
 Let’s pull back the curtain.
The public has good reason to be suspicious of the CDC right now. The changes approved last week by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, are arbitrary, not science-based, and go against decades of safety and efficacy data. Their vote to remove hepatitis B vaccination from the recommended infant and child schedule will lead to a resurgence of hepatitis B.
Prior to recommending newborn vaccination in 1991, 18,000 children were diagnosed annually with hep B, a chronic illness that leads to liver failure and liver cancer. Half of these children were infected through mother-to-child transmission, and giving the shot at birth prevents the virus from taking hold. The other half occurred through contact with saliva or blood exposure to someone else who is infected. The virus can stay active for up to a week on surfaces and is known to have been transmitted during sports and in child care settings, through coming in contact with the virus by touching a contaminated surface, or exposure to scrapes or bites. (Up to half of the children in child care are bitten by another child each year.)
Since vaccination was universally recommended, infection rates have dropped by nearly 99%, and today we see much less liver failure and cancer resulting from hepatitis B infection. No one wants to see those numbers increase again.
 What are physicians saying?
By making ACIP a political committee rather than one based on science means that recommendations are subject to bias and can no longer be trusted. This breach of trust by our government results in lack of confidence in vaccine recommendations across the board, including those by the public’s trusted health care professionals who they continue to see as excellent.
Because politics and politicians are interfering with the patient-doctor relationships and undermining trust in public health measures like vaccines, we will likely see infections rise as we have seen with measles this past year.
While the federal government is spreading misinformation through ACIP and the CDC, the State of New Hampshire is showing that it still trusts doctors over politics with regard to childhood vaccines and is directing New Hampshire doctors to adhere to vaccine recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
As I stated earlier, I work every day to earn the trust of my patients and to share the best medical information and highest quality patient care available. I keep politics out of the exam room, and we need the politicians to stay out of our exam rooms and our relationships with our patients.
When going to see your doctor, remember that we work for you and our recommendations are based on years of training, a dedication to science, and, most importantly, a commitment to partnering with you to make the best decisions for your health.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vaccinemeasles-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-12-12 05:57:04.660141

A federal judge is allowing a case to proceed challenging Ohio’s plan to fund a new Cleveland Browns stadium with residents’ unclaimed funds. Attorneys for the state had asked the judge to dismiss the case; plaintiffs wanted to halt any transfer of money out of the unclaimed funds trust fund.
U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus declined to do either. But Jeff Crossman, an attorney representing the citizens challenging the state doesn’t see it as a draw.
“I think the judge is convinced there’s some smoke here, and there might actually be some fire as well,” he said, “and that’s why he’s letting the case proceed.”
Crossman remains optimistic about their case and said they’re still considering an appeal to halt the transfers set to begin Jan. 1, 2026.
The claims
State officials urged the court to scrap the case, insisting the plaintiffs, who have property in the unclaimed funds trust fund, lack standing and have suffered no injury.
Rather than sue the state, the argument goes, the plaintiffs should just claim their property.
What’s more, the proposed transfers haven’t even started, and rightful owners will have a ten-year grace period to reclaim their money after they do.
Sargus batted those arguments away.
He pointed to a Supreme Court case out of Pennsylvania known as Knick.
“There,” he wrote, “the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs need not exhaust state remedies to have an ‘actionable’ takings claim in federal court.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He added subsequent lawsuits have applied the Knick decision to unclaimed funds cases, allowing plaintiffs to go forward “even if they had not pursued state law remedies for recovering unclaimed funds first.”
The state next argued the court should abstain because the dispute is a state issue and it should get hashed out in state courts. But the judge disagreed. The state statutes in question aren’t ambiguous or overly complicated and federal courts have ruled on similar cases before.
“Plaintiffs contend that these provisions violate the Takings Clause and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, which are federal issues that Ohio’s administrative process would not resolve,” Sargus wrote.
Attorneys call for timeout on Cleveland Browns receiving unclaimed funds

On the other hand, the judge determined the avenues available for reclaiming funds — filing a claim prior to transfer, or within the ten-year grace period, or by appealing to the Ohio Court of Claims — make it impossible to justify blocking the state’s plans.
One element of obtaining an injunction is demonstrating you’d suffer “irreparable harm” without court intervention.
“Here, plaintiffs cannot establish that they will suffer irreparable harm without an injunction,” Sargus wrote, “because monetary damages are available to compensate plaintiffs for any alleged violation of the Takings Clause.”
What’s next
Crossman’s case makes two central arguments.
First, it’s unconstitutional to take Ohioans’ money and hand it to a private organization like the Cleveland Browns without just compensation, and second, it’s unconstitutional to do so without providing prior notice.
“The state admitted this on the stand repeatedly,” he said. “They do not send any notice to any specific purpose. They do these generalized campaigns to make people generally aware to check on unclaimed funds.”
The stadium funding plan converts Ohio’s unclaimed funds program from one that holds residents’ assets in perpetuity to a fund that eventually flows into state coffers. To Crossman, that’s embezzlement, just slower.
“What incentive does the state have to notify you at all?” he asked. “It’s an immediate conflict of interest between you and the state of Ohio. Imagine if your stockbroker, holding your stock, had no incentive to make sure you actually got your money.”
Ohio Capital Journal reached out to attorneys representing state officials in the case, but they declined comment.
Unless Crossman’s team successfully appeals for an injunction at a higher court, the state will begin moving funds out of the unclaimed funds trust fund on Jan. 1.
That portion, made up of assets that have been in the fund for at least 10 years, is worth between $1.7 and $1.9 billion.
State lawmakers have actually appropriated $1 billion of that total — $600 million for the Browns stadium and the rest for “other qualifying projects.”
Lawmakers’ underlying motive for tapping unclaimed funds was that they could pay for the stadium without using taxpayer money.
But Crossman said that’s misguided.
“That $600 million, if that was an improper purpose, an improper taking for that purpose, then the state’s going to have to reimburse the trust account for the money it took out,” he said. “And you know, where does that money come from? It comes from you and me, right? It comes from the taxpayers.”

Ohio brewers fear the state’s new ‘intoxicating’ hemp ban will kill the buzz of the booming THC‑infused drink industry.
While the drinks poured, brewery Urban Artifact’s Scotty Hunter watched the clock tick.
“It’s really impacted our business quite a bit more than I would have expected,” Hunter said.
The Cincinnati business sells THC-infused beverages, drinks that have driven profits.
“We have improved our revenue by 30% two years in a row,” he said. “We’ve added jobs.”
But recent decisions by Ohio politicians are leaving him high and dry.
Well, just dry — not high.
“We saw about a 50% drop in our sales in the state of Ohio because of that executive order,” he said.
In October, Gov. Mike DeWine signed a temporary ban on hemp that gets users high. The THC products can look like candy, and they’re sold at places like gas stations and smoke shops with no age limits.
State lawmakers voted on Tuesday to send a bill to Gov. Mike Dewine, one banning the vast majority of “intoxicating” hemp.
“Not only has intoxicating hemp been impacting our industry, but it’s also impacting public health in general of Ohioans,” Marijuana advocate Adrienne Robbins said after the Senate vote.
Robbins, who fought for the hemp prohibition, is glad to see the products banned.
“The fact that this bill is going to take those dangerous products off the shelf sooner rather than later is a huge win for the whole state,” she said.
But the legislature carved out a small exception for brewers like Hunter. Stores with liquor licenses will still be able to sell low-level THC drinks until the federal hemp ban kicks in next year.
If Congress rescinds its ban, Ohio Senate President Rob McColley said he may be open to allowing the drinks.
“That’s something that we might take up again and see if we could put in a regulated process around that,” McColley said.
Bobby Slattery, founder of Fifty West, said he believes THC drinks are the future for the beverage industry, adding that this year has been their lowest for beer production but highest for overall production, thanks to their THC line. He is also worried about a total ban.
“It would have a major impact on jobs inside the state and to our consumers that are drinking these,” Slattery said.
The state’s craft brewing association has also spoken out against the legislation.
Hunter is worried that by the time a possible hemp system gets put into place, the buzz will be gone.
“Potentially wipe out an entire industry,” he said. “We’re looking at trying to adjust for that big of a drop in sales.”
The governor is set to weed through the legislation, but is expected to sign it in the coming weeks.

Why not Kansas?,Eric Thomas,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/12/12/australia-just-banned-teens-from-social-media-why-not-kansas/,"Half a world away this week, Australia’s government implemented a law that feels just as relevant to Kansas.

(Illustration by Eric Thomas/Kansas Reflector)Half a world away this week, Australia’s government implemented a law that feels just as relevant to Kansas.
The nation banned social media for teens under the age of 16, including some of the most popular apps for young people, such as Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. (Some social media remained accessible this week.) Through the ban, Australian politicians aim to short-circuit teenage reliance, if not addiction, to social media and, by proxy, cellphones.
While this is happening 9,000 miles away in Australia, the political and legal debates in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne signal something about Kansas’ approach to social media in our heartland homes and classrooms.
As the dad of a 16-year-old son and a daughter who just aged out of being a teenager, setting boundaries about cellphones has been an almost daily discussion for me and my kids for the past five years. From my son: “Can I have Instagram to work on a project for my club at school?” From me: “Please be sure to store your phone in the kitchen rather than your bedroom when you go to bed tonight.”
Parenting teens in the age of social media demands daily grit. Once you give teens even a little bit of social media access, they will use that limited permission like a crowbar, peeling back further access each day. Providing them even a bit of leverage inevitably becomes more and more.
One social media app becomes two. Two hours of screen time becomes three. Three days a week becomes seven.
As an instructor at the University of Kansas, one of my goals is to make class so engaging and fast-paced that students don’t have time to check their notifications from Instagram or play cellphone games.
Nevertheless, last week, a student continued an epic, if fictional, battle on his cellphone: a game of Clash Royale while I stood right beside him lecturing. Only after I interrupted the class to explain how distracting his gameplay was did he pocket the device.
Teaching teens in this age of social media is like waterproofing a boat constructed of sponges. Just when you think you have sealed every square inch, there is another leak in their attention.
Because we need to change the relationships that our American teens have with cellphones, I believe that the Australia ban is vital — but doomed.
Let me explain.
Australia’s so-called fix may be short-lived because of a constitutional challenge filed this week. The New York Times reported that two 15-year-old Australian teens argue the ban “infringes on their right to political communication.” The ban itself might be banned.
Here in the United States, if we mimic Australia by instituting a nationwide ban on teen social media use, it couldn’t clear a challenge under the First Amendment — and rightly so. Freedom of expression belongs to teens as well as adults. With two decades of social media behind us, the genie is out of the bottle. Social media is certainly protected speech, whether for adults or teens.
If Australia’s ban would be so obviously doomed, especially here, how is it vital?
Australia’s ban widens the Overton window when it comes to teens and cellphones. A major national government has enlarged what we can imagine as an acceptable political intervention aimed at social media. In this way, the Australian ban was vital to restart the conversation about teens and social media.
We needed some government to overstep. All credit to lawmakers down under.
If Australia can enact such a law, then certainly the United States or an individual state (hello, Topeka!) could make some incremental move.
As a culture, we have become irrationally OK with teens sitting at the dinner table with one hand on the Chipotle fork and another on their phone. As parents, we have become OK with teens barricading their bedroom doors to doomscroll each evening. As teachers, we shrug at the student in the back row thumbing through TikTok, an AirPod dangling from one ear.
The extreme freedom of unrestricted teen social media use has failed.
At the opposite extreme, as embodied by the Australia ban, outlawing everything from Instagram to Snapchat likely won’t work for legal reasons.
The solution is in the middle rather than at the extremes (so boring) and about defaults rather than bans (even more boring).
The most promising tactic to throttle the mania of teen social media use is to mandate specific default settings inside social media apps. When users start up the app and provide their age, social media apps could more insistently and aggressively set defaults for settings such as screentime limits, profile privacy and notifications.
Yes, the settings could be changed, but default settings would provide parents guidance.
It would also provide parents cover, similar to the collective action urged by the group Wait Until 8th. That group asks parents to sign a pact with other parents so that there is collective, community will. Default actions could function in largely the same way.
Many social media apps dedicate pages to the safety settings that they implement for teens. But this is some weak tea. Snapchat, for instance, creates default settings for teens ages 13-17, including public profiles and location sharing. That’s helpful, but not enough.
The outright ban in Australia makes universal default settings for teens seem politically reasonable. Default settings for teens inside social media are not bans — not even close.
Instead, they are norm-setting, signaling to parents and teens that there are measured and healthy ways to use apps.
From this American parent and teacher to the Australian government, this is my thank you — for acting so ambitiously that my suggestions seem downright gentle.

(Getty Images.)Public health is not defined only by the absence of disease, it is shaped by the safety and equity of our communities. In Ohio, discrimination has become a public health crisis that demands serious action, action we can and must take at the local level.
Discrimination of any form, whether based on sexual orientation, gender identity, race, disability, or immigration status, directly harms health.
Yet too many Ohio communities, including my own city of Lorain, still lack comprehensive protections that ensure people can live, work, and raise families without fear.
If we want healthier, safer, and more stable cities, we must stop framing equity as divisive politics and finally recognize it for what it is: a public health necessity.
As someone who has written and passed protections across multiple Ohio jurisdictions, including at the county level, I’ve seen firsthand how discrimination fuels psychological distress, homelessness, chronic illness, and suicide.
After these protections were adopted, I received hundreds of messages from families and individuals who finally felt safe enough to seek mental health support which is a shift that mirrors what research has shown for years.
Local health officials I’ve spoken with consistently reinforce that point, that exclusion damages health outcomes at every level.
The cost of this intolerance isn’t abstract.
A 2015 study published in Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology developed the “Costs of Discrimination Assessment,” which quantified how stigma interrupts daily life.
The findings were pretty stark: discrimination pushed individuals to withdraw from the workforce and disengage from their local economy.
Twenty percent of respondents reduced visits to family doctors out of fear of prejudice, and many skipped dental care altogether.
When people avoid preventive health care because they fear mistreatment, manageable issues grow into emergencies, for them and for our local systems.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The economic impact is equally undeniable.
A 2021 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimated that racial and ethnic inequities have cost the U.S. economy $51 trillion in lost output since 1990.
Ohio feels these losses every day. Whenever a qualified worker is sidelined, a family is priced out due to bias, or an entrepreneur is denied capital, our economy loses value.
More recent data makes the problem even clearer.
The Federal Reserve’s 2024 Small Business Credit Survey found that Black-owned businesses were denied financing at more than twice the rate of white-owned firms (39% vs. 18%).
Research from the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that resumes with “white-sounding” names receive 50% more callbacks than identical resumes with “Black-sounding” names.
And when North Carolina passed a single discriminatory bill targeting LGBTQIA+ residents, the state lost $3.7 billion in investments and business, according to an Associated Press analysis.
Here in Ohio, the losses may be quieter, but they are just as damaging and harmful.
The Williams Institute estimates that stigma-driven health disparities alone cost our state more than $150 million every year in lost productivity and health care spending.
Ohioans are practical people. We believe that if you work hard and contribute to your community, you should get a fair chance. Discrimination violates that belief. It judges people not by their character or their contribution, but by who they are and that is not who we are as a state.
We often talk about politics as a battleground, but our communities should be the common ground.
Ohio has always been a place of builders, people who look beyond division and focus on what we can create together.
We cannot build our strongest future if we leave some of our strongest contributors on the sidelines.
Ending discrimination is not about pulling Ohio left or right, but it is about moving Ohio forward. And we are ultimately not defined by party lines, but by how we treat one another.
No Ohioan should have to leave the place they love to find respect or other opportunities. I
t is time to stop building higher fences and start building a longer table, one with room for every voice, dignity for every neighbor, and opportunity for every single family.
Let’s come together as the architects of the future we want, a state where every resident can contribute, succeed, and belong.
That is how we grow stronger economically, and more importantly, how we grow better as a people.

Wes Moore (D) told a gathering of county leaders Thursday that he does not plan to balance his next budget with taxes, while pledging to revisit an affordable housing proposal that local officials last year opposed. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) told a gathering of county leaders in Cambridge Thursday that he will not propose tax increases to close a projected $1.5 billion budget gap in the coming fiscal year.
Moore told officials attending winter conference of the Maryland Association of Counties that “budget decisions in front of us won’t be easy or simple.” He gave few specifics, but took at least one solution off the table.
“We cannot – and will not – balance our budget on the back of Marylanders. This is not a year where we anticipate tax increases,” Moore said. “At the same time, we must right-size programs that need to be made more sustainable.”
Moore and the General Assembly have been warned that they face about a $1.5 billion deficit in fiscal 2027. Additionally, there is about $700 million in budget deficiencies.
State fiscal leaders will get an updated look at the state’s revenue projections for fiscal 2027 when the Board of Revenue Estimates meets Friday afternoon. Friday’s forecast is the last before Moore delivers his budget to the General Assembly.
Lawmakers cautioned on use of reserves to solve nearly $1.5 billion deficit

Moore diverged several times from his speech as prepared. He dropped portions that named President Donald Trump or referenced the White House, instead referring only to Washington or speaking more in more general terms. The majority of county officials in the room hail from rural jurisdictions where Republicans are the majority party.
Moore was warmly received as he was introduced. During his speech, there was some applause from pockets of the banquet room. But there were also few obvious applause lines and attendees for the most part listened quietly.
Moore went off script to talk about one issue — housing.
The governor and the association were at odds in the 2025 legislative session over an administration bill that was aimed at sparking construction of affordable housing in the state. But county officials saw the bill as overriding local authority on zoning and on where projects can be built.
Moore lost that fight and his bill was ultimately defeated. A divide remains. While the administration seems focused on bringing the bill back, county officials have complained that they have had few substantive talks with the Department of Housing and Community Development — a continuation of complaints that surfaced at the association’s summer convention.
Despite any disagreements, Moore told the audience Thursday he was “not going to stop pushing.”
“Sometimes we butt heads on this one,” Moore said. “The thing that I ask you though, is this: If we disagree on the topic of housing on Monday, the only thing I ask is … let’s get back together on Tuesday and let’s keep on working, because I’m not going to stop pushing this housing.”

School districts that depend on hiring foreign workers to fill teacher jobs, especially in special education and bilingual education, say they can’t afford the new fee.","In summary
The Trump administration is now requiring new H-1B visa applicants to pay $100,000. School districts that depend on hiring foreign workers to fill teacher jobs, especially in special education and bilingual education, say they can’t afford the new fee.


There is a new cost to hiring an international worker to fill a vital but otherwise vacant position in a California classroom: $100,000.
In September, the Trump administration began requiring American employers to pay a $100,000 sponsorship fee for new H-1B visas, on top of already required visa application fees that amount to $9,500 to $18,800, depending on various factors. These visas allow skilled and credentialed workers in multiple job sectors to stay in the U.S.
Most foreign workers on H-1Bs in California work in the tech sector. But California also relies on H-1B visas to address another issue: a nationwide teacher shortage and a high demand for staff in dual-language education and special education in K-12 districts. 
Data from the California Department of Education shows school districts filed more than 300 visa applications for the 2023-24 school year, double the amount from just two years earlier. Educators and school officials say its overseas workers on visas are highly skilled, instrumental in multilingual education, and fill historically understaffed positions in special education.
Now education leaders are sounding the alarm that the high additional fee for overseas workers will worsen the strain on California’s public education system.
International employees fill a much-needed gap for school districts
California continues to face an ongoing teacher shortage. In 2023, California K-12 schools staffed 46,982 positions with employees whose credentials did not align with their job assignments, according to data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Another 22,012 educator positions were left vacant that year. Of total misassignments and vacancies, around 28% were in English language development and 11.9% were in special education. 
California school districts have also resorted to hiring teachers who haven’t yet obtained certain credentials, according to a study by the nonprofit Learning Policy Institute. Facing a need for teachers, school districts have found that trained professionals from other countries are willing — and qualified — to take classroom jobs that would otherwise go unfilled.

In 2023, in the Bay Area east of San Francisco, West Contra Costa Unified School District had 381 misassigned positions and 711 vacancies, according to the commission. So the district turned to foreign educators, hiring about 88 teachers on H-1B visas — a majority from the Philippines, Spain and Mexico — to teach in mostly dual-language and special education programs, said Sylvia Greenwood, the assistant superintendent for human resources at the district.
“With our shortages in special ed, they were a good fit for our district. And so, therefore, we kept that pipeline open and brought teachers here from the Philippines to support our students and our students with special needs,” Greenwood said. 
The decline in the number of credentialed special education teachers continues to worsen. Between 2020 and 2024, the number of credentials earned to teach special education decreased by almost 600 across California, according to data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. The number of temporary permits and waivers granted by the commission increased by about 300 during the same period.
Francisco Ortiz, the president of United Teachers of Richmond and a teacher at Ford Elementary School in West Contra Costa, said the workload for teachers in the district will increase if West Contra Costa Unified is unable to bring in new international teachers.
This would create “greater instability” for students, he said, adding, “It’s going to have a great impact in special education, which is already on fire.”
California school district officials say they are unsure they can pay the new fee to fill hiring gaps with international employees. West Contra Costa officials said they do not know yet who will be responsible for paying the new fee: the district, international teachers themselves or another party.
“We are a district that is dealing with a structural deficit as well, and so that cost, in a lot of ways, is going to be very difficult for our district or really any school district, to be able to take that on,” said Cheryl Cotton, the superintendent for West Contra Costa.
“It’s essentially a giant ‘Keep Out’ sign.”Laura Flores-Perilla, an attorney with L.A.-based Justice Action Center
Pasadena Unified, in Southern California, filed about a dozen applications for H-1B visa sponsorships in 2024. Now the district, facing a $27 million budget deficit, will require those applying for H-1B visas to pay for it themselves, according to district spokesperson Hilda Ramirez Horvath. She said foreign employees will also no longer receive other types of financial support, including legal or filing fees related to immigration processing.
Language programs benefit from international teachers
District officials are also worried about the cultural costs of losing international educators. Educators on H-1B visas make dual-language public schools possible, giving families in California a unique multicultural education that sticks with their children for life.
Kelleen Peckham, a mother to two children in West Contra Costa, said she chose to transfer her daughter to Washington Elementary School in Richmond because it has a dual-language immersion program that teaches students to speak and read Spanish. 
Peckham also plans to send her son, who will start kindergarten next year, to the same school even though it takes the family an extra 15 minutes to drive there.
“My husband’s family is from Mexico, and so [their] grandmother, on one side, only speaks Spanish,” Peckham said. “It’s important for [them] to be able to communicate with [their] family and extended family.”
She said if the dual-language immersion program at Washington Elementary doesn’t survive, she would consider transferring her children back to the school in their neighborhood.

Fee spells ‘Keep Out’ to foreign workers
Within weeks of the fee’s announcement, a coalition of international worker groups, unions and religious organizations sued the Trump administration, alleging the fee would inhibit staffing in education, medicine and ministry services.
“It’s essentially a giant ‘Keep Out’ sign for prospective individuals looking to utilize the visa process to be able to come to the United States and fill these roles and provide these services,” said Laura Flores-Perilla, an attorney with the Justice Action Center, a Los Angeles-based immigration litigation group representing the coalition in its lawsuit.
“It’s not just going to hurt these individuals who have this pathway to do this, but it’s also going to hurt employers within the United States,” Flores-Perilla said.
Although the fee only applies to new visa applicants, many international teachers are feeling less welcomed to work and live in the states. A.F., an international elementary school teacher in the West Contra Costa Unified School District, said many teachers are still concerned the federal government will announce new policy changes that could force them to leave the U.S. 
“I feel like it’s a form of discrimination to impose [a] $100,000 fee for teachers,” A.F. said.

A.F., who is currently on an H-1B visa, asked to only give his initials because he fears speaking publicly will affect his ability to receive a green card in the future. He immigrated from the Philippines to California five years ago on a J-1 visa before transferring to an H-1B visa at the beginning of 2025. J-1 visas allow visitors to temporarily stay in the U.S. to participate in certain programs, including teaching, studying, conducting research and more, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
A.F. said the district previously paid for all of his immigration costs for his H-1B visa, which amounted to more than $3,700 for processing fees and an immigration attorney.
The future is uncertain for H-1B visa hopefuls
H.R., a physical education teacher in West Contra Costa who works on a short-term J-1 visa, said he moved his family from Mexico to the U.S. three years ago to work at one of the district’s high schools because he felt it would be safer to raise his daughter in the U.S. H.R. requested to use only his initials because he doesn’t want to jeopardize his ability to apply for the H-1B visa in the future.
“My biggest reason [for moving] is my daughter,” he said. “Me and my wife decided that it would be a good chance for her [and] a big opportunity to learn the language and to grow up in a different environment.”
H.R. can’t apply for the H-1B visa because he missed the deadline and West Contra Costa Unified is now unlikely to pay for his immigration fees. After his visa expires in June 2026, H.R. will move back to Mexico with his family and reapply for the J-1 visa in hopes of returning to California. 
“Everybody says here that they need teachers in California … but they don’t want to do anything to [help us stay] here,” H.R. said.

At the Los Angeles Unified School District, spokesperson Christy Hagen said in an email to CalMatters that the recent visa changes have not yet impacted the school’s hiring of educators on H-1B visas. Hagen said the district’s immigration experts were “still evaluating the effect of this order.”
Maria Miranda, a representative for United Teachers Los Angeles — the union for Los Angeles Unified teachers — said the district had, as of mid-November, not provided any guidance to its educators or schools on how H-1B visa hopefuls would be supported.
Flores-Perilla, the attorney bringing the lawsuit against the Trump administration, says no hearings have been set in their case yet. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has now also brought a lawsuit over the $100,000 fee, arguing that the proclamation overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and harms U.S. employers.
For now, districts will have to wait on the results of either lawsuit to potentially see some relief in immigration costs.
“It’s absolutely unfeasible to be able to pay this fee [and] to be able to actually bring in prospective employees in their fields and industries, so it’s going to hurt everyone,” Flores-Perilla said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-12 05:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT promised to protect students with dyslexia,Allison Quirion,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/12/connecticut-promised-to-protect-students-with-dyslexia/,"Since the creation of the Office of Dyslexia, the state education department has failed to meet nearly every major requirement legislators put in place.","When the Connecticut legislature unanimously voted in 2021 to create the Office of Dyslexia and Reading Disabilities (ODRD), parents and educators were hopeful.
For the first time, the state had a dedicated office charged with making sure teacher preparation programs, among other things, actually prepared educators to identify and teach students with dyslexia using proven, research-based methods. Legislators backed this work with more than $2.5 million in funding and clear statutory deadlines.
Four years later, the state has little to show for it.
Since ODRD’s creation, the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) has repeatedly failed to meet nearly every major requirement legislators put in place. Among the tasks required by law: develop compliance measures, create audit procedures, verify that educator preparation programs are meeting the dyslexia-related requirements, and report the results publicly. All of these were due between 2022 and 2025. Nothing around compliance has been completed.
Instead of the firm oversight structure the law demands, CSDE has chosen to engage educator preparation programs in “pre-assessment,” surveys, and “reflection” activities that offer no evidence of whether teacher preparation programs are truly preparing future educators to teach students with dyslexia. These activities are not audits. They are not compliance measures. And they cannot verify whether programs are following Connecticut law.
Connecticut is now in its fourth year of delay.
Why this matters
Dyslexia affects roughly one in five children. Research is crystal clear that structured literacy instruction works. Connecticut acknowledged this when designing the statutes that now sit idle. To ensure this actually happens, the law requires CSDE to develop an oversight system that includes compliance measures, audits, and annual verification.
Without that system, teacher preparation programs are essentially operating on the honor system. Families have no way to know whether teachers are being properly trained. And students with dyslexia continue to struggle in classrooms staffed by educators who were never taught how to help them.
A pattern of excuses instead of action
When Decoding Dyslexia–CT (DDCT) raised concerns with the CSDE this fall, the department responded with assurances that everything is on track. But these assurances don’t match the facts.
CSDE claims timelines have been consistent. Yet none of the timelines shared with deans, directors, or advisory committees include dates for creating compliance measures, setting audit procedures, verifying compliance, or publishing required reports.
The department now states that compliance measures will be released in January 2026. This is the first time DDCT or many stakeholders have heard that date. It does not appear anywhere in public meeting minutes, advisory committee discussions, or the documents produced under multiple Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.
CSDE further argues that delays were caused by FOI requests from DDCT. But those requests came years after the state hired a full-time employee to lead this work, and they were processed within a typical two-month timeframe. If searching for documents that should already have existed slowed progress, that only highlights how little groundwork had been laid.
What we know from CSDE’s own records
Documents obtained internally and through freedom of information requests  show that:

As early as November 2023, concerns were raised inside CSDE about the lack of progress on compliance and audit development.
A work plan to create these tools was drafted, yet never executed.
Contracts intended to support this work were amended to delay deadlines, shifting emphasis toward “capacity building” rather than compliance.
A survey was originally communicated as the audit tool until pushback forced CSDE to rebrand it as a “pre-assessment.”

In short, CSDE has substituted workshops and self-reflection activities for the legally required oversight system.
Connecticut’s teacher preparation programs are now being asked to “plan and implement” curriculum changes without being given the compliance frameworks that will eventually be used to evaluate them. This is like asking districts to build a school without a blueprint and promising to send one later.
The result is predictable: confusion, inconsistency, and no accountability.
What needs to happen now
The solution is not more surveys, more reflection activities, or more vague promises. Connecticut must:

Reassign responsibility for this work to experts who understand the intricacies and who were responsible for creating the recommendations that led to the law in the first place—the Dyslexia Task Force and the broader dyslexia community.
Charge the task force to immediately complete the compliance measures and audit procedures required by law.
Restore transparency by providing stakeholders with clear, public timelines that include statutory deliverables.
Conduct the long-overdue audits so that Connecticut finally knows whether teacher preparation programs are preparing educators to meet the needs of students with dyslexia.

Families have been patient. Their children cannot be.
Connecticut made promises to students with dyslexia and the families who have advocated tirelessly on their behalf. The legislature committed the CSDE to oversight, accountability, and evidence-based teacher preparation.
Four years later, none of that has materialized.
The families of Connecticut do not want conflict. We want competence. We want transparency. We want a state that honors both its laws and its children.
The state must act now.

It was the first day of school after a six-week winter break, and the first food delivery the shelter had received since the break began. Carrying three platters, I was surprised when the residents excitedly ran out to help us bring the food inside. 
“Where have you guys been?” one man asked me, excited, and clearly hungry. 
Before that day, I had not realized how much our university’s volunteer food deliveries contributed to the shelter’s food stability and security. Sadly enough, this story of hungry shelter residents relying on an unstable and unpredictable supply of food is not a new one, and is just increasing in prevalence.



According to Connecticut’s Annual Point-In-Time (PIT) count, homelessness increased by 9.5% between 2024 and 2025, with the homeless population rising from 3,410 to 3,735 people. At the same time, food insecurity has increased in the state, where according to Feeding America, one in seven Connecticut residents, including over 122,000 children, struggle with hunger. 
With the recent government shutdown, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the nation’s largest food assistance program, was threatened, potentially increasing the number of hungry and homeless who need help from shelters. Inflation has only made things worse, with  the U.S. Department of Agriculture reporting that grocery prices rose by 2.7% since 2024 and are predicted to rise a further 3% throughout 2025. 
For small shelters with tight budgets, these increases in homelessness and food prices translate to empty kitchens, canned goods, and pleas for help from volunteer groups like Wesleyan University’s Food Rescue. 

Rachel Masterson

 Although volunteer groups are vital for feeding the homeless, donation-based models are inherently unstable. They depend on unpredictable surges in giving, which often peak during major holidays, and decrease in times of economic hardship, such as the period of high unemployment, fuel costs, and food prices that our nation is currently facing. Even when donations arrive, storage facilities and food transportation pose significant barriers to fully utilizing the food donated to shelters, as described in a 2023 article on homeless food intake. 
To ensure that shelter residents have full stomachs, Connecticut must treat access to shelter food as a public infrastructure issue, not a charitable afterthought. I propose three strategies to start this process: 
Firstly, rather than depending on unpredictable donations, shelters should form contractual relationships with local farms through tax-incentive donation programs. Farmers can claim enhanced federal deductions for donating food to nonprofit homeless shelters that are 501(c)(4) organizations. This approach allows shelters to receive a consistent supply of fresh, nourishing food by picking up unmarketable and surplus produce from local farms, while also economically supporting local agriculture and reducing food waste. 
Secondly, the Department of Agriculture should expand the Food System Capacity Building Grant to homeless shelters. Currently, the Food System Capacity Building Grant provides funding to organizations and groups that increase food access and security for Connecticut residents; however, the grant restricts eligibility to food pantries, agricultural producers, farmers’ markets, and local food policy councils. If the Connecticut Department of Agriculture expanded the grant’s eligibility to include homeless shelters, shelters could buy needed kitchen equipment, transportation equipment, and sufficient food during the grant’s up to 18-month funding period, which would have lasting positive impacts on the shelter’s ability to cook and distribute food to their residents.
Lastly, shelters should leverage food waste recovery programs, as the U.S.Food and Drug Administration estimates that 30-40% of the food supply goes to waste. Shelters can partner with nearby restaurants and grocery chains for scheduled weekly food drop-offs, and Connecticut can provide tax incentives for safe food recovery, which would further encourage lasting partnerships. 
Although inflation and homelessness are only increasing over time, Connecticut has the power to prepare for these trends and change the narrative. State legislators need to prioritize stable funding for shelters in the next budget, and residents can support shelters by continuing to volunteer while also holding elected officials accountable. 
I look forward to the day I pull into the food shelter’s parking lot near me, and no one greets me at the door or rushes to take the food in. Where I am met with appreciation, but not desperation, relief, and empty stomachs.

The Buccini Pollin Group celebrated the grand opening of their local grocery store, Pretty Eddie’s Market, on December 10, 2025.
 
WILMINGTON — The Buccini Pollin Group officially opened the doors of Pretty Eddie’s Market to the Wilmington community in a grand opening ceremony, Wednesday afternoon. The store aims to fill a need for members of the downtown Wilmington community looking for an easily accessible and walkable place to find a little bit of everything. 
“Pretty Eddie’s was created to meet the daily needs of the downtown Wilmington neighborhood, offering both everyday essentials and thoughtful extras,” said Robert Buccini, co-founder of the Buccini Pollin Group, via a press release. 
Pretty Eddie’s resides at 730 N. Market St. near Farmer & The Cow and just down the street from Bardea Food & Drink. The store sits alone as the only grocery store within walking distance for those living in apartment complexes like The Press and The Residences at Rodney Square. The store front Pretty Eddie’s now inhabits was vacant for over five years. 
“I moved here two years ago, and I don’t drive, so it’s a little inconvenient. And I’ve been really waiting for this grocery store,” said Sally Kupchock, a resident of the area. “I’m very happy about this.”
Kupchock was one of many community members that braved a little bit of rain to check out the store after the ceremonial ribbon was cut by Buccini and his team. The 2,000 square foot store was packed full of community members taking a look at all the offerings and sampling some of what the store has to offer.

The shelves were stocked with fresh produce, snack items, and normal pantry essentials like pasta sauce and canned foods. The store has a frozen food section in the back as well as cleaning supplies and pet food. There is a deli counter where customers can get deli meats and order sandwiches to sit and eat — there is a small seating area attached to the counter. Customers can also purchase coffee from the store’s coffee bar or small flower arrangements.
“The concept for Pretty Eddie’s was to create a fresh take on the traditional corner store, combining the charm of a local market with the ease of modern convenience,” Buccini said in the press release. “Through various partnerships, our business model allows us to pass on savings to our customers, preserving accessibility and variety without compromising on quality.” 
Pretty Eddie’s partnered with ShopRite to help keep their shelves stocked with affordable products throughout the store. The store also features many items from local vendors including the floral arrangements which were supplied by The Bloom Wagon — a company based in Wilmington. Pretty Eddie’s worked with Artisan Exchange and the Wilmington Kitchen Collective to help find local vendors for their store.

Kupchock purchased a package of vegetable dumplings and a rotisserie chicken amongst other things, but said she’d have to come back when the store wasn’t so busy to peruse some more. Kupchock said she enjoyed the selection of products available, and was surprised they had “unusual” selections like the vegetable dumplings. 
“It’s open seven days a week, so I can come over anytime, and especially with the fresh vegetables and fruit, fresh bread, things that I can’t stock up on when I go to a bigger grocery store, you know… it’s just nice,” Kupchock said. 
The store is open seven days a week. Pretty Eddie’s opens at 10:30 a.m. and closes at 7:30 p.m. everyday, except for Sunday. On Sundays, the store will be open from 10:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. 
There is a current promotion that will run until the end of the year where customers will receive a free tote bag if their purchase is $50 or more, according to the press release. Patrons can also join “The Pretty Chicken Club” and earn a free rotisserie chicken following the purchase of ten.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PE1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-11 23:57:00.451099

Mike Dunleavy is proposing to spend more than $1.8 billion from the state’s principal savings account to balance a first-draft spending plan that would cover Alaska’s response to recent disasters, the state’s annual expenses in the next fiscal year, and a 2026 Permanent Fund dividend worth about $3,800 per recipient.

Mike Dunleavy is proposing to spend more than $1.8 billion from the state’s principal savings account to balance a first-draft spending plan that would cover Alaska’s response to recent disasters, the state’s annual expenses in the next fiscal year, and a 2026 Permanent Fund dividend worth about $3,800 per recipient.
The governor unveiled his plan Thursday, ahead of the Dec. 15 deadline to submit a first-draft state budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2026. 
The governor’s $7.75 billion draft budget is similar to what he proposed last year, but this year’s proposal also includes a substantial supplemental budget intended to compensate for unforeseen costs in the current state budget. 
That supplemental budget includes a large amount of transportation spending caught in a dispute with the Alaska State Legislature, and an additional $40 million for the state’s disaster response fund, a figure that could rise if President Donald Trump fails to approve a 100% reimbursement rate for the Typhoon Halong disaster requested by the state.
Thursday’s proposals won’t become final unless approved by the Legislature, and legislators have revised each of Dunleavy’s prior budget proposals before they became law.
Alongside his annual budget proposal, the governor unveiled a draft 10-year plan that appears to call for billions of dollars in tax increases to avoid deficits in future years.
Alaska has no statewide personal income tax or sales tax; more than 60% of general-purpose revenue comes from an annual transfer from the Alaska Permanent Fund, and about 30% generally comes from oil.
The long-term plan published by the governor’s Office of Management and Budget is required by state law, and both Dunleavy and previous governors have used prior plans to demonstrate their ideas.
Dunleavy did not hold a news conference to answer questions about his plan on Thursday, but members of the governor’s administration said he intends to unveil his long-term approach in January, before state legislators open their regular session in Juneau.
“As many of you know,” the governor said in a prerecorded video released Thursday, “oil prices are down … that negatively impacts our budget, and so we will have to fund the budget from savings this year. We all understand that spending from savings and spending the PFD is not a sustainable way to support a budget.”
Dunleavy, who is term-limited and unable to run for governor again, is entering his final year in office. Elected in 2018, he has proposed a variety of ideas each year but has thus far been unable to garner sufficient legislative support for them.
Simultaneously, he has vetoed incremental legislation to address the state’s fiscal problems, most recently with a bill that would have shifted tax revenue from other states to Alaska.
On Thursday, legislators said they were skeptical but hopeful that 2026 might bring a different result to the perennial debates over how to balance the state’s budget in the long term. “It’s probably doubtful,” said Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok and a member of the Senate Finance Committee. “But I’m going to stay on the hopeful side, because I know that’s really where we need to be. I’m always going to think that other people will finally say, ‘enough’s enough.’”
In all but one year during his time in office, Dunleavy has proposed a dividend paid under a disregarded but still-on-the-books formula that dates from the 1980s. 
In 2017, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers may ignore that formula because it is not in the state Constitution. Since then, legislators have typically reduced the dividend to what is payable without spending from savings. 
Entering his last year in office, Dunleavy is proposing to spend $2.4 billion on the dividend. Divided among 624,000 recipients — the number of eligible Alaskans in recent years — that’s roughly $3,800 per person.
Dunleavy proposed a similar dividend last year; legislators ultimately approved a $1,000 PFD that could be paid without spending from savings.
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the House Finance Committee, said that at first glance, the governor’s proposal is “very much a status quo budget” when it comes to state services, albeit with some changes.
The governor plans funding for a separate Alaska Department of Agriculture, though the creation of that department has been challenged in court by the Legislature.
Funding for the Alaska Department of Corrections is up by 3%, while funding for the state’s Medicaid program is down. No money has been earmarked for the state program that pays for major maintenance and renovations at schools, and funding for public school operations is flat.
Dunleavy is proposing to refill the state’s higher education investment fund — used to pay for college scholarships — after it was drained last year during a budget dispute with the Legislature.
At the same time, the Alaska Department of Revenue is forecasting lower oil revenue due to a declining price forecast. The state Department of Natural Resources expects higher production in fiscal year 2027, but it isn’t enough to fully offset the lower prices.
To balance the budget despite the expected decrease in oil revenue, the governor is proposing to spend from the Constitutional Budget Reserve, which is the state’s principal savings account and contained about $3 billion as of Thursday.
Between supplemental spending and the upcoming fiscal year 2027 budget, Dunleavy is proposing to spend over $1.8 billion from the reserve.
Taking money from the reserve requires three-quarters of the House and three-quarters of the Senate to agree.
In previous years, that’s been a difficult task: The House and Senate are each controlled by coalitions that have taken a skeptical and at times critical view of many of the governor’s policies.
Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said on Thursday that the Senate Majority’s position is that the reserve should never be used for recurring expenses.
One-time expenses, like refilling the disaster response fund and the higher education investment fund could be acceptable, he said.
House Minority Leader DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, said it’s too early to say what members of the 19-person, all-Republican House Minority caucus might want in exchange for voting to spend from the budget reserve.
“That’s still unfolding,” she said.
She also cautioned that the governor’s proposal is just a first draft and that it could change significantly before lawmakers convene in January. If oil prices or production fall below what’s forecast, the state might need to spend more from savings.
If additional disasters occur, that might mean another draw from savings.
“We’re just looking at the very beginning, but it’s not going to get better,” she said. “It’s just going to get worse, most likely.”

Presidential pardons have been universally understood throughout American history to apply only to federal crimes, not state crimes. Peters was convicted on state charges, and legal experts view the prospect of a pardon for Peters as legally implausible.
Trump announced the pardon on social media.
“Today I am granting Tina a full Pardon for her attempts to expose Voter Fraud in the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election!” wrote Trump, who has repeatedly demanded that Colorado release Peters.

Peters, 70, is incarcerated at La Vista Correctional Facility in Pueblo. The Republican was convicted by a Mesa County jury for her role in a 2021 security breach that was part of an effort to find evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. She was sentenced in October 2024.
Claims that the election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.
Peters’ Florida-based attorney, Peter Ticktin, applied to the Trump administration last month for a pardon, as first reported by Newsline. Last week Ticktin sent Trump a nine-page letter in which he detailed his argument that Trump has the power to pardon Peters. He says the Constitution’s references to the United States apply to the individual states as well as the country as a whole, concluding that the president “has the power to grant a pardon in any of the states of the United States.”
Phil Weiser, the Democratic Colorado attorney general, previously said that a presidential pardon for Peters “will not hold up.”
“One of the most basic principles of our constitution is that states have independent sovereignty and manage our own criminal justice systems without interference from the federal government,” Weiser said earlier this month.
The chair of the Colorado Democratic Party, Shad Murib, said Trump “has no legal authority” to demand that the state release Peters.
“We’re not surprised by President Trump shouting into the wind and issuing a meaningless pardon for his friend and fellow election denier Tina Peters,” Murib said in a statement.
