Leaders have learned their original spending plan underestimated contracted costs, with its new higher total requiring a half-million dollars in cuts just to return to the 12% tax hike defeated at March Town Meeting.

With the addition of the omissions and other accounting adjustments, the base budget’s corrected total is $426,732 more than initially calculated, according to administrators and their updated spreadsheet.As a result, the town selectboard will have to cut nearly a half-million dollars from the new number just to level down to the 12% tax hike defeated last month, leaders have determined.“The budget news is really disappointing,” selectboard Chair Elizabeth McLoughlin said at the start of a special Thursday session on the topic.Five and a half hours later, the board asked Town Manager John Potter to return this week with a plan to cut $500,000 in expenses for the fiscal year that starts July 1. That would allow leaders to present a revised proposal at a special Town Meeting on May 27 that’s lower than the original, if only by about $75,000.“The numbers have been corrected and our task has gotten way more difficult,” selectboard Vice-Chair Oscar Heller said.Heller, newly elected to the board, headed the town’s advisory Finance Committee this winter when it issued a rare public resolution questioning why local leaders, facing double-digit-percentage increases in staffing, health insurance and trash disposal costs, weren’t studying decreases in the biggest single source of spending: personnel.READ MORE





 


In a first, Brattleboro Town Meeting rejects proposed municipal budget

“We recognize that the concept of staff cuts is painful,” the committee said in its statement, “but we believe that considering it is an essential part of the responsible management of the town.” The selectboard at the time — which lost three of its five members in March when the former chair didn’t run for reelection and two incumbents were defeated — chose not to reduce employees. On Thursday, continuing board member Peter Case, who has opposed layoffs, asked how the town would achieve $500,000 in savings.Replied Potter: “It’s going to come from positions.”And McLoughlin: “Nothing is off the table.”The selectboard is scheduled to receive and review proposed reductions at a special session this Thursday. Leaders so far have chosen not to fill two open administrative jobs: assistant town manager and finance director. But they are considering the addition of three firefighters after determining that station overtime is so high — currently upward of $700,000 or more annually — that hiring help would be less expensive.“I don’t see any way to reduce that number,” new Fire Chief Jay Symonds said of the overtime spurred by vacancies and contract requirements, “other than adding staff.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brattleboro rejected a $25M municipal budget as too high.

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Just two years after Minnesota became the first state to extend unemployment insurance to school bus drivers, cafeteria workers and teachers’ aids, Democratic legislators are considering eliminating the benefit after summer 2028 to reach a budget deal with Republicans.
The law continues to face stiff opposition from school districts, which say paying for unemployment benefits for hourly school workers takes critical funding away from the classroom while making it harder for them to find workers to fill part-time summer positions.
Advocates say the benefit provides a critical lifeline to workers, who make around $17 an hour, while helping school districts retain experienced staff year after year.
The Republican and DFL co-chairs of the House Education Finance Committee on Monday presented a budget agreement (HF1388) that provides additional funding for school districts to pay for unemployment benefits in the coming year but repeals the benefits in four years.
Democrats tried to amend the education budget bill to maintain unemployment benefits for hourly school workers, but the effort failed on a tie vote in the evenly divided committee. The budget was then laid over to be taken up by the House Ways and Means Committee.
House Education Finance Committee Co-Chair Rep. Cheryl Youkim, DFL-Hopkins, called agreeing to eliminate the benefits her “biggest disappointment” during Monday’s hearing and said she hopes they can find a way to retain it going forward.
Setting the repeal date so far in the future means Democrats could reverse course again and keep the benefits going if they win back control of government.
But some Democrats say they aren’t willing to vote for the deal and bank on a strong election in 2026, which means the issue could divide the DFL House and Senate caucuses and become a key sticking point in budget negotiations over the next three weeks.
The Legislature is set to adjourn May 19; they need to pass a budget by June 30 to keep the government open.
More than half a dozen House Democrats held a news conference on Friday with hourly school workers during which they blasted Republicans for demanding a repeal of the benefits long afforded other seasonal workers like those in construction.
“This is a line-in-the-sand moment for Democrats,” said Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, who authored the bill in the 2023 legislative session.
Kristen Scott, who’s worked as a special education paraprofessional for 20 years in the Elk River School District, said the unemployment benefits have helped her stay afloat during the summer months, when full-time work in schools is hard to come by.
“It also allows us to continue to come back each year to do the important job of helping all of our children thrive,” Scott said. “Cutting unemployment benefits will force many in my field to seek other full-time jobs, leaving our kids wondering who will be there to care for them year after year.”
School districts haven’t had to pay anything toward unemployment benefits because the Minnesota Legislature created a $135 million fund to cover the costs until 2027 or the funds ran out.
Benefits cost an estimated $45 million in 2023 and $57 million in 2024, according to the Minnesota Department of Education. That leaves about half of what’s expected to be needed to pay for the benefits this summer.
Gov. Tim Walz has proposed shoring up the fund with $30 million for this summer to help districts cover the cost, and a DFL-led Senate proposal would provide an additional $70 million the following year.
After that, school districts would have to factor in the cost of unemployment into their regular budgets.
Greenman said they passed the bill in 2023 with the expectation that school districts would eventually pick up the cost without state aid.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-67-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) WEST DES MOINES — Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig announced Monday the state agriculture department invested in 14 urban water quality projects, including one that backs up to the historic Jordan House where he spoke. 
The project in West Des Moines will add bioretention cells, or rain gardens, native plants and a stormwater wetland to the Legacy Woods Nature Sanctuary, as part of its plan to expand to include trails and recreation for the public. This will help to capture and clean stormwater runoff before it reaches Jordan Creek and Raccoon River. 
“Our investment, on the part of the department, is focused on water quality, but we know that projects like this also provide other values for the community, and we love those layered benefits of education and recreation and cultural preservation,” Naig said.

He said the cost-share grants announced are another way to adhere to the state’s Nutrient Reduction Strategy and said visible urban projects like the one at Legacy Woods can be inspiring to visitors. 
“I hope it’ll inspire folks who spend time here to consider what they might do on their own property, but also other cities can come and see how this can be incorporated into the landscape,” Naig said. 
Russ Trimble, mayor of West Des Moines, said he was proud of his city’s continued efforts to improve and preserve its natural resources. 
“Water quality improvements aren’t just the responsibility of rural Iowa farmers,” Trimble said. “It’s incumbent upon all of us to do our part to clean up and improve our water.” 
The grants cover up to 50% of each of the 14 projects and are funded, in part, through the state Water Quality Initiative. IDALS invested $250,000 into the wetland project in West Des Moines and overall invested nearly $2.7 million for all of the projects. 
Including the local matches, the urban water quality projects will leverage more than $5.7 million for projects located in: Algona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Cedar Rapids, Clear Lake, Clinton, Decorah, Des Moines, Dunlap, Durant, Evansdale, Mount Ayr, Oskaloosa and West Des Moines.
Projects range from adding permeable parking lots and pavers to infrastructure, landscaping with oxbows and rain gardens or using native species and wetlands to filter runoff water. 
Naig made the announcement during Iowa Soil and Water Conservation week, and said all Iowans have a role to play in soil and water conservation, regardless of where they live or what type of property they own.  
“There’s certainly more work to do, but we’re seeing progress towards achieving our Nutrient Reduction Strategy goals,” Naig said. “Projects like this make a difference.”

Shri Thanedar speaks at his election night party in Detroit on Aug. 6, 2024 | Ken ColemanMichigan Congressman Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) on Monday brought seven articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, saying the president has “repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve,” and “represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s constitution and our democracy.”
In a statement from Thanedar’s office, he pointed to “sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law” as his reasons for introducing the charges. 
“[Trump’s] unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act,” Thanedar said. 
Each article alleges a separate violation of the Constitution, with Thanedar’s office offering the following breakdown of his resolution:

 Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice.
Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds.
Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations.
Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech.
Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution.
Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain.
Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.

“This is not about partisanship. It’s about protecting our democracy and ensuring that no one, not even a President, is above the law,” Thanedar said in a statement. 
Thanedar’s effort is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, where Republicans hold a seven seat majority. The Senate, which conducts the trial should the resolution receive a majority of votes in the House, is also held by Republicans, with a two-thirds vote needed in order to convict the president. 
Thanedar’s introduction of the articles comes the same day that his second primary opponent, state Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), announced he would seek his 13th District seat in the 2026 primary.
This is a breaking story and will be updated.

Collectively, they form the financial linchpin to the state’s next budget and would generate the revenue needed to erase a chunk of a shortfall Ferguson has pegged at $16 billion over the next four fiscal years. The tax package is expected to net around $9.4 billion over that time.
Democrats drew up the bills. They used their majorities in the House and Senate to pass them over the opposition of Republicans and a few moderate Democrats.
It is not known if the first-term Democratic governor will sign them all. He rejected Democrats’ recent $12 billion package as unsustainable and too risky.
Before that, Ferguson stated his objections publicly to relying on a novel wealth tax that was an original cornerstone of Democratic lawmakers’ approaches. So it got set aside.
He shared his dislike privately of raising the cap on annual property tax growth. It disappeared. As did a payroll tax on large companies.
Below is a breakdown of five tax bills heading to the governor, which would help pay for spending in the two-year $77.8 billion state operating budget lawmakers approved. These measures do not cover the slate of tax and fee increases legislators are relying on for the separate transportation budget.
House Bill 2081 is the most far-reaching, affecting an estimated 191,000 taxpayers, per the latest fiscal analysis. It is projected to bring in the most money of the tax bills, nearly $2.1 billion for the next budget and $5.6 billion over four years. That covers roughly a third of the shortfall.
It permanently increases the state’s two primary business and occupation tax rates on gross proceeds — 0.471% and 0.484% — to 0.5%, starting Jan. 1, 2027. Another provision of House Bill 2081 boosts the tax rate for service businesses with annual taxable revenue exceeding $5 million from 1.75% to 2.1%. 
Financial institutions with annual net income of $1 billion or more would see the rate for an additional tax they pay rise from 1.2% to 1.5% starting Oct. 1. This will impact about 200 businesses, Democrats have said. 
About 400 corporations with more than $250 million in annual revenue would be subject to a 0.5% surcharge for three years starting Jan. 1, 2026. That extra would be levied on amounts above the $250 million threshold. Among those exempted from that surcharge is Boeing. 
There’s also a major change in a levy on technology companies that goes directly toward higher education, including student financial aid. The “advanced computing surcharge” applies to firms with global revenue above $25 billion — think Microsoft and Amazon. It would raise the tax rate from 1.22% to 7.5% and boost a cap on payments from $9 million to $75 million. 
Senate Bill 5814, the other major money-maker for the state, is counted on to raise $1.1 billion for the next budget and $2.7 billion over four years. It would do so by applying the retail sales tax to more services, such as temporary staffing, advertising, security and lobbying. The change would occur Oct. 1 and affect an estimated 35,000 firms, according to a Department of Revenue analysis.
It also contains a provision to begin taxing certain products with nicotine, like Zyn pouches. If it becomes law, this new tax takes effect Jan. 1, 2026.
And an estimated $1.1 billion will flow into coffers of local governments around the state since they receive a share of sales tax.
Senate Bill 5813 will add a layer to the capital gains tax. In addition to the existing 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests, the bill tacks on another 2.9% for gains exceeding $1 million. About 900 taxpayers would be impacted.
The bill also makes revisions in the state’s estate tax — a tax on the right to transfer property at the time of death. Rates would increase, but the value of property excluded from the tax would climb to $3 million, up from the current $2.1 million. Lawmakers assume this legislation will generate $321.6 million for the next budget, and slightly less in the one after that.
Senate Bill 5794 seeks to bring in revenue by getting rid of tax breaks that the Department of Revenue estimates are used by 15,000 taxpayers. These changes are counted on to bring in $148.5 million for the next budget, according to budget documents.
Among the many tax preferences targeted for elimination are ones exempting sales of precious metal bullion. Another change would make operators of self-service storage facilities begin to pay taxes on the renting or leasing of individual units.
House Bill 2077 would begin taxing the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. This has been dubbed the “Tesla tax” because the firm led by Elon Musk is the only automaker with credits to sell in Washington. This brand-new tax is projected to generate $54.5 million for the operating budget.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/money-closuep-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Keith Jackson, a Democratic lawmaker from Kemper County, can remain in office despite a felony indictment by participating in a pre-trial intervention program, according to court documents. 
A grand jury last year indicted Jackson, a first-term House member, on charges of receiving stolen property – specifically, a 2006 Magnolia timber trailer worth about $15,000. The grand jury also indicted two other people, Fredwrick (sic) Young and William Tate, in connection with the criminal charges. 
Jackson did not respond to a request for comment, and his attorney, Christopher Collins, declined to comment. 
Cassie Colman, the district attorney in the 10th circuit district, told Mississippi Today that the state agreed to let Jackson participate in pretrial intervention because he had no prior criminal record. If Jackson completes the terms of the pre-trial agreement, then the criminal charges will be expunged from his record. 
Going to trial would likely be risky for the lawmaker because, if convicted of the offense, he could lose the right to hold elected office. 
Receiving stolen property is a disenfranchising crime in Mississippi, and if someone is convicted of a disenfranchising crime, they lose their right to vote. To run for office in Mississippi, someone must be a registered voter. 
But Coleman, who prosecuted the case against Jackson, said the legislator’s agreement to enter the program is neither a guilty plea nor a conviction. Instead, he will enroll in the intervention program for at least a year and pay around $3,350 in fees, according to court documents. 
If he fails to meet the terms of the agreement, the district attorney could remove him from the program and prosecute him for the original crime.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/28134326/jackson_45th.jpg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Speaking Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press”, Sanders was asked about Slotkin’s suggestion in an interview with Politico that Democrats needed to fight back against the perception that they are “weak and woke” and stop using the term “oligarchy” when criticizing Trump and his allies, such as billionaire Elon Musk, and instead say they are opposed to “kings.”

“Well, jeez, we had 36,000 people out in Los Angeles, 34,000 people in Colorado. We had 30,000 people in Folsom, California, which is kind of a rural area,” Sanders said, referencing recent “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies he and fellow progressive, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), has hosted in opposition to Trump administration policies.
“I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are,” Sanders said.
A request for comment was made to Slotkin’s office by the Michigan Advance, but has yet to be returned.
Slotkin, who won her Senate seat in 2024 by less than 20,000 votes out of more than 5 million cast, has made her political career out of winning tight races in districts and states that otherwise supported Trump.
Her rising star in the party was exemplified by Slotkin’s selection to give the Democratic response to Trump’s address to Congress in March.

However, in his “Meet the Press” interview, Sanders, who drew an estimated 10,000 supporters in early March to Lincoln High School in Warren, Michigan, said an acknowledgment was necessary about the nature of the forces championing policies that have deepened the nation’s economic inequality.   
“The very rich getting richer, working class people are struggling, 800,000 people sleeping out on the streets. If we don’t address that issue, the American people will continue to turn their backs on democracy because they’re looking around them and they’re saying, ‘Does anybody understand what I am going through?’ And unfortunately, right now, to a large degree, neither party does,” Sanders said.
Slotkin, posting on the social media platform X on Friday, said Democrats needed more than rhetoric if they hope to win against Republicans.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)State employees in South Dakota will soon have a secure web portal to submit allegations of misbehavior by their coworkers.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order telling the state Bureau of Human Resources and Administration and the Bureau of Information and Telecommunications to create a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal will deliver reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
The order also requires supervisors and encourages employees to submit such reports, and directs the human resources department to conduct training in ethics and use of the portal.
The order is an outgrowth of Senate bills 62 and 63, which tightened the state’s internal controls after a series of 2024 scandals involving former state employees. 
Governor prevails in dispute over penalties for supervisors who stay silent on misdeeds

One such employee, Lonna Carroll, used her position at the Department of Social Services to illegally collect nearly $1.8 million over the course of 13 years. A jury found Carroll guilty of grand theft earlier this month.
Other former employees stood accused of forging vehicle registrations, falsifying food service inspections and using foster family food service vouchers for themselves.
Representatives for Rhoden and Attorney General Marty Jackley sparred during the 2025 legislative session over whether supervisors should face felony charges for failure to report state employee misdeeds. 
Rhoden’s office argued supervisors should face misdemeanor rather than felony charges, particularly if the unreported employee misbehavior isn’t felonious in nature. The kerfuffle over that provision in SB 62 forced multiple rounds of debate, one of which appeared to doom the bill before a revival effort the following day. In the end, lawmakers narrowly sided with Rhoden.
In a press release announcing the creation of the online reporting system, Rhoden wrote that the executive branch took “decisive action” to address the rash of corruption cases.
“Under my leadership, South Dakota will have a government that is accountable and responsible with taxpayer dollars, and this executive order is an important step forward,” he wrote.

We are ready to make sure our Democratic values get heard in the bills that we pass. We will be fighting bad bills. We will be making sure that we get appropriations that are impactful for our districts at home.”
She added that she considers herself a unifier.
“I want all my members to shine, and that is going to be my goal, to make sure that each member of our caucus has the opportunity to move forward and do the job that we were are all elected to do, to represent the people of our districts.”
Pizzo’s resignation was the latest in a series of devastating blows that the Florida Democratic Party has suffered in recent years. The party fell into superminority status in both the state House and Senate after the 2022 elections — in which its candidates for governor lost by 19 points and for U.S. Senate by 16 points.
A year earlier, the Republican Party for the first time took the lead in voter registrations in Florida, a lead that has since increased to more than 1.2 million voters. Then, after the Democrats failed to win back any new seats in the Legislature last fall, they saw their numbers in the Florida House dwindle by two more last December to just 33 in the 120-member body after Hillsborough County Rep. Susan Valdés, and then South Florida’s Hillary Cassel, announced that they were ditching the Democrats to go Republican.
Criticism
With Pizzo’s departure and the death of Orange County Sen. Geraldine Thompson before the session began in March, there are now just 10 Democrats in the 40-member Senate.
In announcing his resignation, Pizzo said that the “Florida Democratic Party is dead,” adding that “there are good people that can resuscitate it, but they don’t want it to be me.”
Pizzo added more criticism of his now-former party over the weekend.
“I’ve spent thousands of hours trying to resuscitate something that’s just not there, and we just got so consumed with taking the bait and the opportunity cost lost with going ahead and going down a rabbit hole of socially divisive issues that — there was no plan. If you go on whether it’s the state [web] site or a local site as it relates to party, there’s no policies. There’s no plan,” Pizzo said in an interview aired Sunday on WPLG television in Miami. “There’s just a lot of anger and a lot of hate — which I understand, because it’s been a generation of Republican control.”
Berman and House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell disputed that assessment.
“Unfortunately, we had to be reactive in past years because there were so many bad bills that came through and so much policy that you had to react to, but I think we clearly have an agenda,” Berman said. “Our agenda is to help the working people here in the state of Florida. To make sure that people can get access to health care. To support public education. To make sure that we have a clean environment for everyone to flourish.”
Driskell said that in fact what she calls the party’s “platform bills” have been focused on making life better for everyday Floridians, not on culture war issues.
“They focused on making housing more affordable,  expanding Medicaid so we can help health care be more affordable for all of us, protecting our drinking water and our natural resources. Focusing on commonsense gun solutions, gun reform. … We focus on protecting workers, we focus on investing in our kids in terms of public education, so those are the issues that we center on, but please understand that, as a party of opposition, where we have to stand up and fight for the Constitution and fight for the least among us, we will do it at every time.”
Hope Florida
Berman and Driskell later focused on developments in the saga revolving around Hope Florida, the welfare program started by First Lady Casey DeSantis, which has dominated the second half of the legislative session in terms of news coverage.
A House committee announced last week that it was ending its investigation into reports of $10 million going to the Hope Florida Foundation from a state Medicaid overpayment settlement. Much of that $10 million was later sent to a political committee run by James Uthmeier, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ former chief-of-staff (now state attorney general), that was working to combat last year’s referendum on recreational cannabis.
“I don’t think this issue will fade,” Berman said, “because when everybody goes home to their districts over the summer, they are going to hear about this issue and I really believe that … we need to continue to investigate this issue. It should not be allowed to go without a response, whether it’s a legal response or whether it’s a political response, but we should never allow this kind of graft to happen in our state of Florida.”
Boca Raton Democratic Rep. Kelly Skidmore said that Gov. DeSantis certainly hopes that the controversy over Hope Florida will fade.
“That is why he is going so hard after his own Republican colleagues, because he wants them to be afraid and not focused on this fraud that was perpetrated on taxpayers.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/0-1-1024x598.png,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

(Image via Maine Legislature live stream)A Republican lawmaker who had been censured by her legislative peers for posting personal information about a transgender student on her official social media account is taking her fight to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Rep. Laurel Libby of Auburn said she filed the petition Monday after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied her motion for an expedited appeal to end the censure by the Maine House of Representatives.
“For over 60 days, my constituents have had no say in actions taken by their government, actions that directly impact their lives,” Libby said in a press release. “Every vote taken on the floor of the legislature is a vote my constituents cannot get back. The good people of our district have been silenced and disenfranchised.”
On Feb. 25, the House voted 75-70 to formally reprimand Libby, preventing her from speaking or voting until she apologizes for the post, which she has so far declined to do.
The post, which included the name, photograph and other details about a transgender student athlete, drew national attention. Days later, President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding to Maine over the state’s transgender policy, arguing it is in violation of federal anti-discrimination protections. Since then, the state has been subject to several funding cuts and probes, culminating in a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Libby is arguing that the censure is a violation of her First Amendment right. Additionally, Libby’s lawsuit against Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) and House Clerk Robert Hunt asserts that their sanction is a violation of her constituents’ right to free speech and that it disenfranchises the voters by depriving them of legislative representation.
On Friday, Justice Melissa DuBois of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine denied Libby’s request for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the censure, arguing that legislative immunity — which largely protects lawmakers from being sued for strictly legislative acts — shields Fecteau and Hunt from the claims in the case.
While acknowledging that the ability to suspend an elected representative’s privileges to speak or vote on the House floor “is a weighty sword to wield,” DuBois determined Fecteau’s actions “ultimately reflected the will of the majority of the House members” and that the sanction “is not of such extraordinary character as to obliterate the formidable shield the courts have provided to legislative acts.”
There have only been four censures in the Maine Legislature since 1820 and three of them — including the ongoing censure of Libby — have come in the past year and a half under Democratic majorities. The first censure was an independent from Auburn in 2001.
Libby appealed that ruling to the 1st Circuit Court, which on Monday denied her motion for an expedited ruling, according to Maine Public.
Seeking immediate intervention, Libby filed an emergency request with the U.S. Supreme Court and said while the broader case continues through the appeals process, she is “hopeful the court will act swiftly” to end the censure.

Free.,Trump border czar defends removal of U.S. citizen children,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-border-czar-defends-removal-us-citizen-children,,"WASHINGTON — White House border czar Tom Homan on Monday blamed the parents of U.S. citizen children the Trump administration sent to Honduras over the weekend.At a Monday morning press conference, Homan defended the government’s actions to remove three young children from two different families alongside their mothers who were in the country without legal authorization but participated in a program that allows otherwise law-abiding migrants to stay in their communities.“If you enter this country illegally, it’s a crime,” Homan said. “Knowing you’re in this country illegally, you put yourself in that position. You put your family in that position.”The children, all under the age of 10, were placed on deportation flights to Honduras on Friday after their mothers checked in with a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in New Orleans as part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, which allows immigrants to stay in their communities while undergoing immigration court proceedings.An attorney for one of the children, Gracie Willis at the National Immigration Project, said the 4-year-old U.S. citizen with Stage 4 cancer was deported without access to his medication.Homan has argued the mothers requested to be deported with their children, but attorneys for the families argue they were “denied access to legal counsel, and swiftly deported without due process.”Due process concernsU.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, whom Trump appointed to a seat on the Louisiana federal bench in 2018, expressed concern that a 2-year-old U.S. citizen had been deported, despite her father’s wishes she remain in the U.S., according to court filings.Doughty scheduled a May 16 hearing because of his “strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.”“The government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,” Doughty wrote in his order. “But the court doesn’t know that.”Willis, from the National Immigration Project, raised concerns about a lack of due process and how the deportations have separated families.“What we saw from ICE over the last several days is horrifying and baffling,” she said in a statement. “These mothers had no opportunity to speak with their co-parents to make the kinds of choices that parents are entitled to make for their children, the kinds of decisions that millions of parents make every day: ‘what is best for our child?’”Homan has argued the children were deported at the request of the mothers and that the Trump administration was “keeping families together.”“What we did is remove children with their mothers who requested their children depart with them,” he said. “When a parent says, ‘I want my 2-year-old baby to go with me,’ we made that happen. They weren't deported. We don't deport U.S. citizens. The parents made that decision, not the United States government.”Wisconsin judgeMonday’s remarks from Homan come the day before President Donald Trump will mark the 100th day of his second term. His early days in office have centered on carrying out his campaign promise of mass deportations of millions of people in the U.S. without permanent legal status.Trump will sign two executive orders on immigration late Monday: one relating to border security and another to require the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to publicly list so-called sanctuary cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration law enforcement.Homan also stood by the Trump administration’s decision to arrest a federal judge in Wisconsin on the grounds she obstructed immigration officials from detaining a man attending his court hearing. It marked an escalation between the Trump administration and the judiciary branch, raising concerns from Democrats.The arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan was highly publicized after she was handcuffed in public and FBI Director Kash Patel bragged about the arrest on social media.Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Fox News that the Trump administration was going to continue to go after judges who “think they’re above the law.”“When you cross that line to impediment or knowingly harboring, concealing an illegal alien from ICE, you will be prosecuted, judge or not,” Homan said.",,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Sara Attleson is the new chair of the Democratic Party of New Mexico, according to voting results announced on Sunday.
Attleson, of Albuquerque, chairs the party’s Labor Caucus, as well as the Albuquerque Teachers Federation’s Committee on Political Education. She defeated Marisol Enriquez, Letitia Montoya and Joseph Weathers to lead the party. Former Chair Jessica Velasquez did not seek reelection.
Attleson said in a statement she wants to work with county-level Democratic parties “to make sure we have a presence in every community.”
“Democrats across the country have our work cut out for us,” she said in a statement. “But here in New Mexico, we have the energy to make sure that MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump are never able to get a foothold here.”
DPNM announced the results at the spring meeting of its governing body, the State Central Committee, at the Albuquerque Little Theater following voting by 466 SCC members via online absentee ballot from April 19-26. The new party officers’ terms end in 2027.
Party members elected Cameron Crawford as vice chair. Crawford, of Santa Fe, defeated incumbent Manny Crespin and Augustine Montoya to win the seat.
“In an era of unprecedented political turmoil, I will go to counties red and blue to rebuild community by showing up for everyone, regardless of who they vote for,” Crawford said in a statement. “Politics is about making people’s lives better, and I’m more than prepared to take that message far and wide.”
The party elected Brenda Hoskie as its treasurer. Hoskie, from Springstead, is an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation and chair of the McKinley County Democrats. She defeated Daniel Alfredo Garcia and Barbara Jordan to become secretary.
Members elected Julie Rochman as Secretary. Rochman, of Albuquerque, defeated Joseph Ortiz to become treasurer.
The Republican Party of New Mexico elected its party officers in December.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Fire Administration)The state of South Dakota will spend up to $250,000 to clear PFAS chemicals from local areas in the coming year.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS or “forever chemicals,” break down at an exceedingly slow rate in the natural environment. They’re found in products like nonstick cookware, water-resistant items like umbrellas or rain jackets, and cleaning products, among other items. 
Concerns about their prevalence in the environment and their impacts on human health have grown steadily in recent years, as they’ve been discovered in drinking water, fish and food packaging.
SD House defeats bill requiring ‘forever chemical’ labels on firefighting gear

PFAS are also found in a kind of firefighting foam that’s fallen out of favor, but fire departments around the U.S., including in South Dakota, still have some and need to dispose of it.
The South Dakota Board of Water and Natural Resources awarded a $250,000 Solid Waste Management grant to the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) last month to help communities collect and dispose of some PFAS sources. The citizen-led water resources board evaluates projects and signs off on funding through the solid waste program.
The grant will allow fire departments with PFAS foam, or schools whose science labs may still have chemicals, to summon the department’s contractor to collect and safely dispose of them at an out-of-state location. The state will also reach out directly to agencies, and has begun to contact fire departments, airports, and other public entities by phone to find out if they have PFAS for disposal.
The money comes from the Inspection, Compliance, and Remediation program, funded by a mix of fuel tank inspection fees and the sale of lottery tickets. Typically, cleanup grants through the program cover 80% of cleanup costs, with the entity requesting cleanup expected to cover the rest.
The South Dakota Legislature approved Senate Bill 33 this year to let DANR put $250,000 of program funds toward PFAS cleanups with no local match.
Andy Bruels with the DANR told the water resources board in March that a previous PFAS cleanup a few years ago cleaned up “a fair amount of material.” The contractor hauled it out of state for disposal, as typical landfills can’t adequately prevent the chemicals from continued seepage into the environment.
The legislation also allowed for the grants to be used in waste tire cleanup, but Bruels said the primary focus will be PFAS and that it’s unlikely much will be left for that secondary purpose.

(Photo courtesy of FEMA)Attorney General James Uthmeier settled a suit Monday accusing the former Federal Emergency Management Agency head and a FEMA supervisor of discrimination against supporters of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump during disaster relief efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton.
The suit came in November, after the supervisor advised relief workers in Florida to avoid houses displaying yard signs favoring Trump in Lake Placid, in Highlands County. Uthmeier agreed to drop the suit in exchange for an apologetic letter on behalf of the federal government, according to the notice of dismissal filed Monday.
“The United States and Ms. Criswell regret the actions giving rise to this case and agree with the State of Florida that those actions never should have occurred,” the letter states. “We are also hopeful that, in light of all we have provided, the State of Florida and its people can be confident that FEMA is striving to avoid a repeat of the events giving rise to this case and that the agency is committed to the fair, compassionate, and even-handed delivery of services.”
The letter from the U.S. Department of Justice also states that FEMA commits to providing political-discrimination training for employees.
Deanne Criswell, the former FEMA head, didn’t admit wrongdoing, and the letter directs responsibility to Marn’i Washington, the supervisor. As part of the settlement, Criswell and the state agreed to pay their own attorney fees, and Uthmeier also dropped the claims against Washington.
Former Attorney General Ashley Moody, whom Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed to the U.S. Senate, originally sought nominal and punitive damages from Criswell and Washington.
Criswell announced on Nov. 9 that the agency had fired Washington and called her behavior a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles. Moody’s complaint cited multiple interviews in which Washington said the message she sent to the relief workers, which the Daily Wire published, lacked context and that her supervisors knew about and encouraged her decision to avoid the homes of Trump supporters.
In a letter to the federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Washington wrote that she had received numerous death threats and that she didn’t have knowledge of the suit for months.
“The effort for scapegoating at my expense has methodically been implemented to the point that all of my inquiries and fair treatment throughout this process has been negated and intentionally delayed,” Washington wrote to U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks.
Uthmeier’s office did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

Ritchie’s team further pointed a recent ruling handed down by the Indiana Supreme Court in which justices “unanimously agreed that Ben has brain damage caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol and other toxins.” But the court was split, 2-2, on whether Ritchie should be allowed to present evidence “of the effect of that damage on his behavior” on the night of his crime.
With clemency, the governor — in tandem with Indiana’s Parole Board — can elect to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment or grant a pardon for a criminal offense.
The parole board announced two upcoming clemency hearings for Ritchie to consider his petition: one on May 5 at the Indiana State Prison, located in Michigan City; and another on May 12 at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis.
Both meetings are open to the public. The parole board will conduct a 10 a.m. interview with Ritchie at the state prison hearing. During the latter meeting, the board will hear testimony in favor of clemency from 9 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and testimony opposed to clemency from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
The developments follow a ruling issued earlier this month by Indiana Supreme Court justices to set a May 20 execution date for Ritchie, who was convicted in 2002 for killing a law enforcement officer from Beech Grove.
What to expect
The Indiana Constitution gives the governor exclusive authority to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons for all offenses — including capital crimes — except for treason and impeachment. The parole board is tasked by state law with assisting in that process.
The five-member board, specifically, is responsible for conducting an investigation into the merits of a clemency petition. 
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Shortly after an execution date is set, the board sets a schedule for the filing of clemency petition; submission of supporting materials; an interview and psychiatric examination of the death row inmate; a public hearing; and a public announcement of the parole board’s recommendation.
Story continues below.
Benjamin Ritchie Petition for Clemency (compressed)
 
Members of the press and the general public are permitted to attend the inmate’s interview. 
The subsequent public hearing typically takes place two or three days prior to the execution date and is held in the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis.
Each side — the state and counsel for the death row inmate — is given 90 minutes to present their case for or against clemency. The parole board presides over the hearing, and frequently interjects with questions.
Once complete, board members individually submit their recommendations to the governor, who has final say over the matter.
Defense team seeks a stay
In a separate legal filing last week, Ritchie’s defense team petitioned the state supreme court for a new hearing to reconsider the inmate’s request for post-conviction relief.
They’re also seeking a stay to pause the execution altogether “to permit the full and fair consideration of the issues presented” in the rehearing request. Ritchie’s latest petition, attorneys emphasized, “has asserted unusually complex questions of fact and law that would be aided by oral argument or further briefing on the issues if the Court allows.”
The high court denied Ritchie any post-conviction relief in a decision issued April 15, following a series of exhausted appeals previously filed by the inmate and his legal team.



In 2004, former Indiana Gov. Joe Kernan commuted the death sentence of Darnell Williams to life imprisonment without parole on the basis that his co-defendant initially received a life sentence, making it “unjust” to execute only Williams.
Kernan, a Democrat, commuted another death sentence in 2005 of Michael Daniels, emphasizing doubts about Daniels’ personal responsibility for the crime and the quality of legal process leading to his death sentence.
The most recent was in 2009, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Mitch Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, in part citing questions about Baird’s sanity.
The former Republican governor additionally noted that life without parole in murder cases was not an option at the time of Baird’s sentencing; it became an option in 1994.



Included in the post-conviction filings were claims that his trial and post-conviction counsel “provided ineffective assistance” by not investigating Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and by failing to “analyze the effect of Ritchie’s childhood exposure to excessive amounts of lead.”
Additionally, counsel emphasized that Ritchie was only 20 years old at the time of the crime, and “recent developments in the law” require the state supreme court to consider his age at sentencing. Ritchie’s team held, too, that the state “engaged in prosecutorial misconduct” throughout his jury trial.
Chief Justice Loretta Rush, who disagreed with the decision to deny further post-conviction relief proceedings, said in her opinion that she believed evidence submitted to the court suggested “a strong likelihood” that Ritchie suffered from FASD when he murdered William Toney, the police officer, in 2000.
Indiana Supreme Court sets May 20 execution date for death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

Rush noted that Ritchie had recently been evaluated by two FASD experts, and she preferred to hold off on an execution date so the court has more time to “receive and consider” the experts’ evaluations.
But Justices Derek Molter and Geoffrey Slaughter said in their opinion that “what Ritchie’s experts turned up is irrelevant.” The issue before the court “is not whether Ritchie suffered from FASD in 2000 or whether he does so today,” they said. Rather, the justices must decide whether Ritchie’s trial lawyers “were constitutionally ineffective during sentencing for failing to investigate the possibility that Ritchie suffered from FASD then.”
The affirming justices maintained that Ritchie was unable to show a “reasonable possibility” of relief. 
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney, the Beech Grove police officer, later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at Toney, who did not survive the shooting.
The court set a Monday afternoon deadline for Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office to respond to the defense counsel’s motions.
The Republican attorney general requested an execution date for Ritchie last fall.
Executions were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. The state paid $900,000 on execution drugs but won’t say how much was purchased. 
Ritchie and six other men remain on the state’s death row at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.

“As it relates to cannabis markets, Missouri is pretty famously the model to follow,” said Mackenzie Slade, CEO and owner of New York-based Cannabis Public Policy Consulting. “So I’m very interested in doing a super deep dive.”
In March, the state issued a request for proposals looking for a vendor to conduct a cannabis market and economic impact study. Currently, Missouri has issued nearly 400 cannabis licenses to operate full-scale cultivation and manufacturing facilities and dispensaries. The state will also eventually have 144 microbusiness licenses, which are limited in size and scope and meant to benefit disadvantaged business owners.

In 2024, Missouri sold$1.46 billion in total marijuana sales in the state’s second year of adult-use marijuana, outperforming states with a longer history of marijuana legalization like Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.
The results of the study will help the state determine “whether or when the state will be required to issue additional cannabis facility licenses and, if so, how many, where, and of what type,” according to a March press release from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
Missouri received three responses that fit the requirements of having at least five years of experience specializing in the economic impact of marijuana, or at least 10 years of experience conducting economic impact studies in general.
The responding agencies were Slade’s firm, St. Louis-based Capital Consulting Services and Oregon-based Whitney Economics. The firm that wins the bid will be awarded the $X million contract. 
Beau Whitney’s company, which conducts studies globally, gathers data monthly on the cannabis industry for each legal state on business licenses, supply capacity and revenues. 
“I have data that goes back multiple years,” he said, “and so I can say, ‘Here’s the progression of the state and its program,’” along with providing future projections 10 years out. 
Whitney calls Missouri a “success story.” In one of his recent reports that looked at investment potential nationwide, he found there’s still opportunities for growth, development and investment into the Missouri market. 
“And that’s unusual,” he said. “In Oregon where I’m based out of, I just gave an update to the Office of Economic Analysis and I basically said, there’s no investment opportunity in Oregon for any new businesses. Zero for the next 10 years.”
That’s because there’s too much supply, an over saturation of licenses and prices are so low that people can’t make any profit, he said. 
“My goal with Missouri is to give them the data that they need to avoid that scenario,” Whitney said.
Slade has seen the same in New York, where her firm has been based for about seven years. 
Her company administers a national survey on cannabis use, which essentially measures and quantifies demand behavior for consumers. One of the things that they use it for, she said, at a national level is to try to understand how states are performing based on their policies. 
“And Missouri continuously outperforms other states, relative to their date of sale,” she said. “…because they were able to stand up a market so quickly.”
Secrecy around ownership records raises questions about Missouri marijuana networks

That was in part because Missouri limited the number of licenses to get operational within just a few months. For the study, Slade proposed to use the state’s track and trace data to identify the efficiencies of the licenses. 
“That’s a prime example of where we would uncover some extremely important considerations for policy,” she said. “And I do believe that the intent of the study is to identify areas of policy that need to be updated.”
Tracey Jeffries’ company, Capital Consulting Services, has helped governments with economic feasibility studies for 15 years on a state and federal level, and she’s a certified Missouri minority-owned business enterprise as a Black woman owner. According to state policy, winners of any state contract must employ 10% minority-owned and 5% women-owned businesses. 
The advantage Jeffries believes she brings to the program is knowing her state and its economy, having led projects throughout Missouri. 
“DHSS has done a great job,” she said, “but it’s timely to have the feasibility study because this will benefit the regulators, the businesses, and most importantly to me, in my opinion, the community.”
State law says the cannabis regulators may “lift or ease any limit on the number of [cannabis] licensees or certificate holders in order to meet the demand for marijuana in the state and to ensure a competitive market while also preventing an over-concentration of marijuana facilities within the boundaries of any particular local government.” 
Experts generally agree that Missouri’s decision to only issue the minimum licenses allowed under its constitution has been the key to the industry’s boom. However, critics have long argued that the decision created a monopoly that’s kept out opportunities for people who were most impacted by the War on Drugs. While the microbusiness license program was included in the 2022 consutitional amendment to address inequities, the limitations on what these businesses can do make it difficult to turn a profit. 
If the department does issue additional licenses, at least half of those licenses must be awarded to owners of cannabis microbusiness facilities that have been operational for at least a year.
The study will also provide information regarding the overall economic stability of the regulated market, including strengths and risks, with a special emphasis on the market’s impact on economically distressed areas of the state. 
Jeremy Washington, spokesman for the Office of Administration, the agency that handles contracting for the state, said there isn’t a “published schedule for the completion of the evaluation process.” 
However, upon completion of the evaluation process, the MissouriBUYS Bid Board will be updated to reflect the changed status.  In addition, the entire procurement file will be published on the Division of Purchasing’s awarded bid and contract document site.

More than 3 million people with Medicare could be eligible for the difficult-to-find and expensive weight-loss drug under new guidance which can cover the medication for patients who are obese or those who have a history of heart disease and are at risk of a heart attack or stroke.  (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.




I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
States consider high costs, possible savings of covering weight-loss drugs for their workers

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Sean Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, convinced the 2025 Legislature to reduce by two-thirds the amount of state income tax credits available to incentivize construction or rehabilitation of low-income housing statewide. Since 2022, Kansas has used the tax credit to make faster progress on addressing the state's housing shortage and advocates of the credit opposed the cutback touted by Tarwater. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Assistant city manager Braxton Copley pleaded with Kansas House members to reject a proposal to end the state’s participation in a tax incentive program shown to be successful in promoting construction or rehabilitation of low-income housing.
Copley, representing the city of Topeka, stood at a microphone in February at the Capitol to address Rep. Sean Tarwater, chairman of the House commerce committee and the sole public proponent of a bill eliminating Kansas’ low-income housing tax credit, or LIHTC, on July 1. Copley wasn’t alone in opposition to the bill. Nearly 40 organizations and individuals offered testimony denouncing details and timing of House Bill 2119.
“Simply put, government cannot afford to construct and manage a sufficient amount of housing to meet the needs,” Copley said. “Developers are unable and unwilling to construct low-income housing because the low rents will not allow them to achieve a market rate of return. The LIHTC program leverages tax credits to induce private developers to construct affordable housing by providing them a market rate of return.”
In exchange for state and federal tax credits, the affordability of the incentivized housing units was assured for terms of 15 years or 30 years with covenants placed on the real estate.
Copley said undercutting the state’s approach to LIHTC would exacerbate homelessness in communities throughout Kansas.
Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, listened as a string of community activists, investors and bankers expanded on Copley’s thesis.
“I must say there are 39 opponents and I’m the only proponent, evidently,” Tarwater said. “This is not fair. You guys are going to need more people.”
Fast forward two months, and Tarwater pushed across the finish line on the final day of the 2025 legislative session the contents of House Bill 2289, which included a modified version of the much-maligned HB 2119. Instead of deleting LIHTC in July, the program would survive, on a shorter financial leash, until 2028.
“This is not exactly what we wanted when we set down this road,” Tarwater said. “We took a page out of Ronald Reagan’s book, and we’re going to take what we can get today and fight for the rest tomorrow.”
Tarwater objected to the ultimate cost of a program adding each year to tax credits that had to be honored by the state. Over a 10-year period, for example, the compounding effect of $25 million annual allocations of LIHTC tax credits could result in a state obligation of $250 million. The figure wouldn’t represent a direct expenditure by the state of Kansas, but would reflect the amount of future tax revenue foregone by the state as investors redeemed credits against their state tax liability.
Last week, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly signed the bundled bill rather than veto the measure and push the issue to the 2026 Legislature.
 
Financial haircut
The new Kansas law set a maximum on the amount of state housing tax credits issued this year at $25 million. In the final three years of LIHTC, only $8.8 million in annual credits would be available from the state for investors in affordable housing.
The law discontinued the state’s LIHTC match for investors receiving the 4% federal low-income housing credit, but retained the state match for developments qualifying for a 9% federal low-income housing credit.
Sen. Stephen Owens, R-Hesston, led negotiations on LIHTC legislation for the Senate. He viewed the final bill as a compromise that resulted in a diminished incentive, but provided a window of opportunity to convince lawmakers it should continue.
“This came to us from the House as a complete elimination of the low-income housing tax program,” he said. “Recognizing that there’s also some value to this program, the Senate’s position was to go back in and reduce it by about 70%.”
The program is managed by the Kansas Housing Resources Corporation, a self-supporting, nonprofit public corporation tasked with helping Kansans gain access to safe, affordable housing.
Emily Sharp, of the state Housing Resource Corporation, said substantial reduction in annual tax credit awards and deletion of the 4% program would diminish the state’s ability to fill wide gaps in housing. There will be a bigger scramble for the remaining credits, she said.
The 2028 sunset to the LIHTC should be concerning to communities struggling to meet housing demand, she said.
She said a 2021 state housing survey was conducted in collaboration with the governor’s Office of Rural Prosperity. The first Kansas assessment of its kind in 30 years showed an acute shortage. It was estimated the state needed to add at least 3,800 units annually, but was falling far below that level.
The National Low-Income Housing Coalition estimated Kansas had a deficit of 50,000 affordable housing units.
“We need more houses,” Sharp said. “Nationwide we’re seeing a shortage of housing. Kansas is no exception.”
 
Evolution of thought
In 2022, the Legislature and governor responded with passage of the affordable housing tax credit act that put in place a d0llar-for-dollar match by the state to the federal low-income housing credit.
The objective was to expand the volume of tax credits available to investors. The credits could be sold to generate revenue for construction of housing. The lower debt assumed by developers meant tenants could be offered below-market rental rates.
The state’s rate of housing development through state or federal investment tripled after implementation of the Kansas reform law three years ago. In 2021, state and federal government resources were associated with construction of 1,028 homes in Kansas. In contrast, 6,500 Kansas homes were funded in 2023 and 2024.
Ryan Vincent, executive director of the state Housing Resources Corporation, said the elimination of the state’s tax credit for housing — currently scheduled for 2028 — would mean that Kansas lagged further behind other states dangling lucrative incentives to attract housing investment.
“Eliminating the KAHTC would send a negative message to current and potential investors, signaling that housing development is a risky prospect in our state,” Vincent said. “Potential partners will avoid investing in an uncertain environment.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/P3051340-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-28 14:11:57.316531

(Kristian Thacker for West Virginia Watch)Morgantown voters on Tuesday will decide the future of a law that would prohibit homeless people from camping on public property.
Early voting in the city’s election has been underway since April 16. 
Morgantown City Council passed the ordinance in September, joining dozens of cities around the country to prohibit public camping after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar camping ban in Grants Pass, Oregon, amid record levels of homelessness. 
Morgantown’s law, which has so far not gone into effect, would prohibit camping on any public property — including streets, parks and trails — and also prohibit storing personal property in public areas. Second and third violations of the law are punishable by fines of $200 and $300 and/or 30 days in jail, respectively. 
After the ordinance passed, Morgantown Coalition for Housing Action successfully petitioned to have it repealed or put it on the ballot during a city election. Council voted four to three for the latter in November. 
According to the city, the camping ban appears on the right side of the ballot under “Ballot issues.” Voting “yes” on “Article 1157 Prohibiting Camping on Public Property” would be a vote to repeal the ordinance. Voting “no” would be a vote in favor of keeping the ordinance in place. 
Voters will also decide their council members in wards two, four and six and a ballot issue to allow the city manager to live outside the city while in office.
Polls open at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday and close at 7:30 p.m.

Witnesses spotted the Otero Fire in the bosque east of Socorro and the Alamo Fire in a neighborhood in Grants on Sunday evening. The Grants Fire is fully contained at between 3 and 5 acres, said Forestry spokesperson George Ducker. Despite progress overnight in Socorro, where crews built a fire line across the northern edge of the 360-acre fire, the Otero Fire is 0% contained, Ducker said. 
The causes of both fires remains under investigation, Ducker said, though they occurred amid high winds and ongoing drought across the state. The National Interagency Fire Center earlier this month warned that most of the state would experience above-normal wildfire risk, and that the risk would spread to the western two-thirds of the state as May approaches. A new forecast is expected in the next few days. 
High winds around 7 p.m. pushed the Alamo Fire on the east side Grants into structures, burning eight structures and six outbuildings and prompting evacuations. Residents are being allowed to return this morning, Ducker said, and crews will focus on watching for hotspots and dealing with the burned structures, now that the fire is fully contained.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Hundreds of leaders at colleges and universities from across the United States recently signed  an open letter to the Trump Administration, rebuking “the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education.”
Only one New Mexico higher-education leader signed the letter — from a small college in Santa Fe.
In the first 100 days, the Trump administration has frozen billions of dollars in research grants and threatened further cuts if universities fail to comply with policies to reshape admissions, curriculum and speech on campus. Broadly, the Trump and Republicans have alleged higher education indoctrinates students with left-wing ideologies, and are using federal funds as leverage to require universities to change campus policies.
Last week, Harvard University sued the Trump administration over its freezing of $2.2 billion in grants after the school refused to comply with federal demands to limit activism on campus.
The letter from academics, released last week by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, pushes back against the Trump Administration, penning a defense of higher education.
“We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight,” the letter states. “However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses. We will always seek effective and fair financial practices, but we must reject the coercive use of public research funding.”
As of Monday morning, the letter had amassed 523 signatures from colleges, universities and scholarly societies.
Leaders from University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University, the state’s largest schools, did not sign on.When reached for comment, Cinnamon Blair, a spokesperson for UNM wrote: “What I can share is that UNM’s participation in any statements is an internal administrative decision, and will be reflected in the public record.”
New Mexico State University spokesperson Amanda Bradford confirmed the administration had not signed the letter, stating: “The university has no further comments on this topic at this time.”
As of press time, Thom Chesney, president of Southwestern College, a private graduate-level school tucked away on Santa Fe’s Southside, remains the only New Mexico school leader on the list.
Southwestern College offers a variety of graduate-level programs and certificates, including: master’s degrees in counseling, art therapy and consciousness in action; as well as a Ph.D in visionary practice and regenerative leadership.
In an interview with Source NM, Chesney said higher education is facing unprecedented threats at multiple levels. Chesney took the position at Southwestern College eight months ago, following three years as president at Clarke University in Iowa and nearly eight years as president of Brookhaven College in Texas, among other academic postings. He’s been in higher education for nearly 30 years and started his work in academia teaching English, American and British literature and the humanities.
“We’ve not seen this before,” Chesney said. “The federal government stepping in and making demands about how we admit, who we admit and what we teach — that flies directly in the face of independence, of building a curriculum.”
Chesney told Source NM that this was the right time for his college to speak out, and said other New Mexican institutions are trying to navigate a difficult position.
“I’m going to defend my colleagues, my peers from the public and private institutions in New Mexico, who haven’t signed the letter,” Chesney said. “They’re not on the sidelines, they’re not silent, in assent or giving in — we can’t assume any of that. They are absolutely, I believe, thinking through where their space is, at this time, for this type of response.”
Chesney said the letter he signed offers the chance to be part of “a collective, unified voice.”
“It fits in with not only the mission of my institution, but also the broader need to respond in a call to action for dialogue, for decorum to come together and recognize we have a shared space, to identify the successes, the flaws — all of that, rather than react reactionarily,” he said.
Chesney noted that all higher education institutions face threats, regardless of size and programs. Southwestern College’s enrollment is just over 320 students. While his institution does not receive federal research grants, some of the students rely on Title IV funds to attend college. The college also offers a counseling center at which its counseling and therapy students receive real-world experience and provide low-cost or no-cost services for 500 Santa Fe residents.
“If someone comes in and says ‘you can’t do that anymore,’ that’s a threat,” he said. “That threatens the wellness of Santa Fe’s Southside, Santa Fe in general and ultimately New Mexico, in my mind.”
Not only did Chesney sign the letter, he hopes his participation in a national dialogue creates an opportunity for students to become more engaged with faculty and administrators in addressing the future of higher education.
And he has a message for prospective students who are considering further training or schooling: “Don’t become cynical.”
“No one should give up on that dream or that aspiration to do the kind of learning that leads them into opportunities to serve and create and have jobs that are for the greater, common good,” Chesney said.

Laura Kelly, pictured here at a May 14, 2024, event in Topeka, signed 11 bills into law last week following the close of the 2025 legislative session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced Friday she had signed into law 11 bills, meeting a deadline and cementing public education funding, tax incentives for major data centers and a new crime for possessing, creating or distributing AI-generated child pornography.
The bills were bipartisan, Kelly said, as she signed them before the end of the 10-day period she has to take action after the Legislature delivers them to her.
Crime and law enforcement
Senate Bill 186 crafted first-time, clear protections for those who are the subject of AI-generated imagery without their consent. It’s an effort to mitigate the harms caused by technology, “in both the digital realm and the physical world,” Kelly said in a news release.
“Given the rise of AI-enabled crime, enhancing public safety for our fellow Kansans is crucial,” Kelly said.
The law applies to the alteration of real photos or generating new material from scratch, said Rep. Brad Barrett, an Osage City Republican who sat on the House committee that heard and negotiated the original bill. 
“This legislation strengthens our child exploitation laws to protect kids from this evolving threat and also updates our breach of privacy law to shield adults from having their images maliciously altered to appear nude or sexually explicit when they have an expectation of privacy,” he said.
The law adds to the definition of sex crimes within the Kansas Criminal Code to include AI-generated material. It also modifies existing criminal bond-setting procedure to hike up bond rates for any defendant with prior convictions of sexually violent crimes. The minimum bond for those defendants is now $750,000, which Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes said addresses patterns of “predatory behavior.”
“This part of the bill ensures the safety of victims comes first,” Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said. “By requiring the consideration of similar prior acts when setting bond, we can alleviate some of the fear for victims.”
Senate Bill 156 increases the amount of money inmates can receive from the Kansas Department of Corrections for losses, personal injury or property damage.
Senate Bill 204 seals criminal and juvenile cases — meaning information is kept secret — until an arrest warrant is executed. It also creates a new appointment process for trustees of county law libraries.
Senate Bill 237 empowers law enforcement officers to investigate violations of the Scrap Metal Theft Reduction Act, which targets scrap metal dealers. It was initially proposed by the Wichita Police Department.
Industry and development
Kelly said a new law that incentivizes major data center projects in Kansas gives “the state another tool in the toolbox to bring jobs, infrastructure, and prosperity to Kansas communities through economic development.”
Senate Bill 98 creates a 20-year sales tax exemption for data centers investing at least $250 million within five years of opening. The exemption could include land acquisition, development and construction, equipment acquisition and permitting, design, engineering, labor for installing and maintaining data center equipment, and lease payments.
Businesses that receive the exemption must by law conserve, reuse, and replace water, pay for electricity from a public utility for 10 years and maintain at least 20 new jobs at the data center within two years of launching.
Kelly also signed into law House Bill 2289, which was championed by Stilwell Republican Rep. Sean Tarwater and enacts limits on housing tax credits. Over time, the law eventually will dismantle the state’s affordable housing tax credit program.
Taxes and government
House Bill 2125 reauthorized the 20-mill statewide school property tax levy to finance public schools through the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 school years. The bill also sets strict deadlines on local taxing entities, enabling county clerks to use a taxing jurisdiction’s budget and tax levy from the previous year if it doesn’t submit budget information by Oct. 1.
House Bill 2231 shifts Kansas to a corporate income tax calculation method that aligns with the majority of states. Kelly said the law evens “the playing field for Kansas-based businesses, making the state more attractive for capital investment, and encouraging job creation.”
House Bill 2335 creates, beginning in January, a new license plate for members of hunting organization Hunter Nation.
House Bill 2007 cleans up statutes that were amended multiple times during the 2025 session.
House Bill 2275 enables a handful of Kansas counties to ask voters whether they favor a sales tax proposal to fund projects. It also creates a tax exemption for custom meat processing sales.
In Finney County, county commissioners want to impose a 0.5% sales tax to finance construction or remodeling projects in the county courthouse, jail, law enforcement center or other administrative building.
In Jackson County, commissioners want to ask voters if they would favor a 0.25% sales tax to support hospital services.
In Pawnee County, commissioners can ask voters if they want to pay an up to 1% sales tax for providing health care services and “furnish” and “equip” public safety operations.
In Seward County, voters will decide if they want to pay a 0.5% sales tax to fund road and bridge projects.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P5140012-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax, a fixture in Northern Virginia politics for more than three decades, announced Monday he will not seek reelection after a resurgence of cancer, saying the sun is setting on his time in public service.
In a statement published on his social media accounts, Connolly thanked supporters for their “good wishes and compassion,” crediting their encouragement with giving him strength “in my fights — both against cancer and in our collective defense of democracy.” 
He revealed that although initial treatments had seemed successful, his cancer has returned. “I’ll do everything possible to continue to represent you and thank you for your grace,” he wrote.
Connolly, 75, said he will soon step down as ranking member of the House Oversight Committee and finish out the remainder of his term with “no rancor and a full heart.” He added, “With pride in what we’ve accomplished together over 30 years, my loving family and staff sustain me. My extended family — you all have been a joy to serve.”
The news struck a deeply emotional chord among colleagues and political leaders across Virginia and Washington, D.C.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., reflected on Connolly’s announcement with admiration, saying, “No one has fought harder when it comes to Virginia’s federal workforce, transportation infrastructure, congressional oversight, and our commitment to critical alliances like NATO.” 
Kaine said he spoke with Connolly on Monday morning, telling him of his “profound admiration for his service and deep love for him and Smitty,” Connolly’s wife.
House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., Connolly’s counterpart on the committee, also expressed his support following the announcement.
“I’m saddened to hear that Ranking Member Connolly’s cancer has returned,” Comer said in a statement Monday. He praised Connolly as “a steadfast public servant who has spent his career serving Northern Virginians with honor and integrity.”
Comer added, “It’s an honor to serve the American people alongside him and I am rooting for him as he battles cancer once again. Our prayers are with Ranking Member Connolly and his family.”
Born in Boston, Connolly’s life reflected a unique mix of scholarship, global expertise, and local passion. He spent a decade with the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, managing oversight on international economics, narcotics policy and U.N. affairs, and publishing reports on U.S. policy in El Salvador, Central America, Israel and the Persian Gulf.
Later, Connolly moved into leadership roles in the private sector at SRI International and SAIC before fully turning to public service in Fairfax County. He was elected Providence District Supervisor in 1995, and in 2003, became chairman of the county’s Board of Supervisors, where he guided Fairfax’s rapid growth while promoting education, environmental stewardship and smart development.
Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, recalled first working with Connolly during those local government years. 
“The congressman was a visionary leader for Fairfax County who moved on to a national role defending federal workers and our democratic institutions,” Surovell said. “Northern Virginia is a better, stronger place because of Gerry Connolly’s tireless advocacy, and our democracy is healthier because of his unwavering dedication.”
Connolly carried that same blend of policy chops and political muscle to Washington after winning election to Congress in 2008. Representing Virginia’s 11th District — anchored in suburban Fairfax County — he quickly built a reputation for mastering the nuts and bolts of government reform.
He co-authored the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act with Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California, seeking to streamline how the government buys new technology and reduces waste. 
Connolly also worked to cut red tape through the Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014, which scrapped about 100 outdated or redundant federal reporting requirements. His commitment to oversight and efficiency earned him recognition as one of the most effective lawmakers in Congress by the Center for Effective Lawmaking.
“Throughout his career, Gerry Connolly has exemplified the very best of public service — fiercely intelligent, deeply principled, and relentlessly committed to the people of Northern Virginia and our nation,” U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Monday. Warner called Connolly “one of the toughest fighters I know” and said he was “keeping him in our hearts and prayers.”
Connolly’s record reflected a consistently progressive bent. He championed abortion rights, voting against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment and supporting federal funding for Planned Parenthood. He campaigned for LGBTQ rights long before marriage equality became the law of the land, backing efforts to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and the Defense of Marriage Act.
He was also a strong advocate for environmental protections, helping to found the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, and supported investments in renewable energy technologies.
Connolly did not shy from political combat, especially during the Trump presidency. He voted to impeach Donald Trump and memorably blasted Republican proposals to rename Dulles Airport after Trump, quipping, “If Republicans want to name something after him, I suggest they find a federal prison.”
State Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, praised Connolly’s fighting spirit and intellect. 
“Congressman Connolly always brings unmatched intellect, wit, and passion to his work,” Bagby said. “Cancer stands no chance against his fighting Irish spirit.” Bagby credited Connolly with making the commonwealth stronger through decades of dedicated service.
In recent years, Connolly continued to dominate his electoral contests, defeating a primary challenger in 2024 with more than 86% of the vote and cruising to reelection against Republican Mike Van Meter. 
Even as health challenges loomed, he maintained an active role in legislative oversight and defending democratic institutions.
Connolly’s retirement marks the close of an era for Northern Virginia, where his leadership became synonymous with effective, passionate advocacy. His colleagues emphasized that his impact would long outlast his time in office.
Former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, also praised Connolly’s legacy and spirit, calling him a model public servant whose impact will be felt across Virginia for generations.
“For more than three decades, Congressman Connolly has stood up for Virginians — dedicating his career to public service and making our Commonwealth stronger,” Spanberger said Monday. “He has responded to the needs of his neighbors, strengthened the communities he represented, and worked to grow the Democratic Party in Fairfax and across Northern Virginia.”

The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.

“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.











I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth endorsed Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton on Monday in the 2026 Democratic primary for Illinois’ open seat to replace longtime Sen. Dick Durbin.

Duckworth’s endorsement comes after Gov. JB Pritzker endorsed Stratton on Friday, one day after she entered the Senate contest. With no other Democratic candidates announcing campaigns for the 2026 primary by Monday morning, Stratton secured the endorsement of two of the state’s top Democrats before fielding any competition.

“Juliana has not only proven to be an experienced and effective Lieutenant Governor — she’s demonstrated time and again that she truly understands and cares for working people,” Duckworth said in a statement. “Their struggles are her struggles. Their wins are her wins.”

Duckworth, a Democrat from Hoffman Estates, will take over as the state’s senior senator in January 2027 after Durbin’s term ends, as he announced last week he plans to retire. An Army veteran who earned a Purple Heart while serving in Iraq, Duckworth was elected to the Senate in 2016.

“Her many years spent in public service, along with her experience as a mom to four daughters and a caregiver to her own mother, have given her the tenacity, grit and perspective to be a true advocate on behalf of working families,” Duckworth said of Stratton.

Durbin told reporters at his Springfield home last week that he will likely not make any endorsements in the primary.

Stratton secured Pritzker’s endorsement Friday. The two have spent the last six years leading Illinois following two successful elections.

Pritzker praised Stratton as a “champion for women’s rights, for job creation, for rural families, for farmers, for criminal justice, for early childhood education,” and credited the lieutenant governor as having played an integral role in his administration.

Asked Friday whether his endorsement tamps down a competitive race for Durbin’s seat, Pritzker said, “Anybody who wants to run should run. But I’m telling you this is the person whose best able to serve with integrity, with honor.”

Stratton, of Chicago, has quickly risen through the ranks of Illinois politics after first being elected as a state representative in 2016. She was elected lieutenant governor two years later as Pritzker’s running mate during the 2018 campaign.

It’s still unclear whether other Democrats will announce they are joining Stratton in the primary as whoever enters the race will go in knowing they won’t be endorsed by two of the state’s leading Democrats.

U.S. Reps. Lauren Underwood, of Naperville, Raja Krishnamoorthi, of Schaumburg, Robin Kelly, of Matteson, and state Treasurer Mike Frerichs, of Chicago, all have said they are considering entering the race.

Meet Jennifer and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
It feels like nowadays, you can’t talk about the professionalized world of fighting for entertainment without talking about Donald Trump.
Earlier this month, Trump and several Cabinet members sat cageside at the UFC match in Miami; Trump himself holds a spot in the WWE Hall of Fame, where his official bio page notes that he’s the first WWE Hall of Famer to hold the presidency. Ahead of last weekend’s annual WrestleMania, wrestling news sites were abuzz with rumors that the president might again be ringside. At the same time, one of professional wrestling’s biggest stars, Roman Reigns, made headlines for declaring himself as a Trump supporter. 
The former CEO of WWE, Vince McMahon, is a longtime friend of the president’s and financial supporter of his political endeavors; McMahon’s now-estranged wife, Linda, is also a former WWE CEO and a current member of Trump’s Cabinet. And the CEO of UFC, Dana White, introduced Trump before he spoke on the final night of last summer’s Republican National Convention — Hulk Hogan also spoke, ripping off his shirt to reveal Trump/Vance campaign merch — and attended Trump’s inauguration in January. 
The kinds of theatrics baked into the massive success of professional wrestling have been on display throughout Trump’s ascendency in American politics. On the campaign trail and now in the White House, a Trump event has a distinctive feel, a well-honed blend of spectacle, pageantry and hypermasculinity. It’s a style that feels lifted from the professional wrestling handbook, where aesthetics and narrative device choices are central to the delivery. In professional wrestling, this product is a form of entertainment that lets fans — predominantly young men — openly feel and freely celebrate masculinity. In the second Trump administration, the product is a barrage of new policy measures intent on crafting a very specific version of America where the feelings of men are prioritized and their power is irrefutable. 
Though not a part of the action in the ring, there’s another significant tie between professional fighting and the Trump administration: allegations of sexual misconduct that have stretched back for decades. Vince McMahon, the visionary showman who made professional wrestling into the cultural force it is today, built the persona of “Mr. McMahon” around being a womanizing, vindictive philanderer — and today faces real-life accusations of sex trafficking, which he has denied. Donald Trump, the visionary showman who reshaped American politics in the mold of reality television, built his industry-spanning brand in part around the idea of being the consummate ladies’ man — and won the presidency for the first time just weeks after the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked in which Trump boasted, “And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything….Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.”
Central to the concept of professional wrestling is the practice of kayfabe, or committing to the illusion that clearly staged events are real and true. It’s a narrative device that asks audiences to suspend their disbelief, not in a way of passive acceptance, but rather active participation in the creation of what is possible. 
“It really does matter how well you’re doing the performance, but then what also really matters is how much the audience is going to buy into it. If they’re emotionally connected, that’s where the buy-in comes in,” said CarrieLynn Reinhard, an associate professor of communication arts and sciences at Dominican University and an expert on narrative devices in professional wrestling. “When you look at what Trump does, he is very good at getting to people’s emotions and understanding their emotions and — I’m going to say — manipulating their emotions for his own goals, and in doing so, he focuses on a reality that he believes in or at least he performs to believe in.”
Reinhard pointed to Trump’s rollout of tariffs — which he touted as immediately bolstering the economy even as markets tumbled — as an example of this dynamic. “What’s interesting is that with that little bit of doubt, his followers, his fans, they have the ability to engage in that rationalization that allows them to say, ‘He’s got a plan.’” 
The gimmicks
Professional wrestling is immensely popular in America, one of the most enduring and dominant forms of pop culture of the past three decades. Just last year, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) merged with the WWE under one new parent company, TKO. UFC is now the fourth-most watched sports league in America, after MLB, the NFL and the NBA. 
And the people who made UFC and WWE what they are today are also inextricably intertwined with the creation and actions of the dual Trump presidencies. 
By the time Trump mounted his first campaign during the 2016 presidential race, the McMahons were already major Republican donors. Linda, the former CEO of WWE and the current secretary of education, contributed a total of $7.2 million to two pro-Trump super PACs that cycle — Rebuilding America Now and Future45 — and the couple together donated more than $10 million to outside groups funding Trump’s race for the presidency. The McMahons also supported Trump before he formally entered politics, donating $5 million to the Trump Foundation in 2007.
Linda McMahon’s ability and facility in playing a role — a skill honed during her time as not only a WWE executive but also an on-screen performer — is essential to understanding her nomination within this administration, according to Kelly Dittmar, an associate professor of political science and the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. 
In naming her to his Cabinet, Trump “chose somebody who was willing to work herself out of a job. He had to find somebody that was willing to go and sit at a confirmation hearing and try to explain how she wanted to be the secretary of education, but also effectively get rid of the Department of Education, which is an incredibly hard position to be put in,” Dittmar said.
It feels not dissimilar to a part she had in what is considered by many fans to be one of the most infamous WWE storylines, playing comatose in a wheelchair for weeks before ultimately rising from her supposed catatonic state inside the ring to kick her philandering husband in the groin on live TV. 
This time, of course, the shock ending isn’t revenge for a titillating affair, but effectively shuttering a major federal agency. 
Dana White, the CEO of UFC, has also been a longtime fixture in Trumpworld. He spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, 2020 and 2024. When it was clear Trump had won a second term last November, White spoke at the victory celebration, saying, “I’m in the tough guy business, and this man is the toughest, most resilient human being that I’ve ever met in my life.” White has long credited Trump for supporting UFC from its start, hosting UFC matches at Trump properties, attending events cageside, and generally being a champion of the brand of macho entertainment that became explosively popular under White’s watch. 
The accusations
The Trump administration and WWE share another overlapping characteristic: The way leaders of both have faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual abuse, or of ignoring such misconduct. 
Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women and long surrounded himself with men who have been similarly accused during his time in the public eye, was found liable by a jury in 2023 of sexually abusing and defaming the advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. In his second term, he put forth multiple nominees accused of or linked to sexual misconduct allegations.    
White has offered more tacit support in other ways that underscore the misogyny and allegations of criminal sexual misconduct that proliferate in Trumpworld. In March, White welcomed Andrew and Tristan Tate ringside. The brothers — who face charges in Romania, including rape, human trafficking, trafficking of minors and sex with a minor — returned to the United States in February. They have denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges against them “garbage” and part of a “conspiracy.”  The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration asked Romanian officials to return the Tates’ passports to them and allow them to travel while the criminal case against them proceeded in court. Trump’s presidential envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, raised the Tates’ case with the Romanian foreign minister. Additionally, Paul Ingrassia, a former Tate attorney, is now a White House liaison for the Department of Justice. 
The McMahons are currently facing a lawsuit accusing them of failing to stop abuse by an employee from the 1970s to the early 1990s. The suit, from “ring boys” who helped with setting up and breaking down wrestling matches, was filed in October. It says that a former WWE employee, Mel Phillips, sexually assaulted the ring boys and that the McMahons fired him in 1988 because of abuse allegations and then rehired him six weeks later. In a February statement, Greg Gutzler, the attorney representing the ring boys, said, “My clients’ lives were destroyed by the defendants who allowed and enabled the open, rampant sexual abuse to occur for years. … We will bring light to their truth and fight for accountability and justice.”
In early April, attorneys for Linda McMahon filed a motion to dismiss the ring boys’ lawsuit, saying that she has no connection to the state of Maryland, where it was filed. She also asserts that she has never met or communicated with the plaintiffs, to the best of her knowledge and memory. Vince McMahon has also denied all wrongdoing. Attorneys for Vince McMahon, Linda McMahon and WWE did not respond to The 19th’s request for comment.  
Linda McMahon’s time in the WWE, including the ring boys’ suit, was barely a topic in her February confirmation hearing. 
Tom Cole was the first of the ring boys to come forward with allegations about sexual abuse while employed by WWE, according to his brother, Lee Cole. Tom Cole died by suicide in 2021. 
Lee Cole said that he thinks people have failed to take the allegations against the McMahons seriously because of their ties to wrestling. “This has always been a wrestling story, and people have always known wrestling has been faked. And so they look down at these things, not knowing whether it’s a job — whether they’re pulling a job — or whether it’s real. They don’t know. People don’t take wrestling seriously,” Cole said. 
Cole said he understands that there has been an increase in attention around the McMahons and the ring boys’ lawsuit as a result of Linda McMahon’s role within the Trump administration. Too often, he said, he has seen reporters miss the mark by focusing their stories on the McMahons through the lens of Trump. 
But to understand Trump, you need to understand the McMahons, the way they have used power, fame, and the ability to craft narratives that keep fans invested in the WWE brand and willing to dismiss the naysayers. 
As a Trump supporter, Cole said he can see the appeal McMahon holds for the administration. 
“They’re entertainers. Linda McMahon is an entertainer. She was part of the entertainment world. Why else would Donald Trump love her so much? He’s an entertainer.”
The ring boys’ suit isn’t the only accusation of misconduct against the McMahons. In 2024, Vince McMahon was sued by former employee Janel Grant; in her suit, Grant accuses McMahon of sex trafficking, making her employment contingent on engaging in a sexual relationship with him and being sexually available to others within WWE. WWE and former WWE executive, John Laurinaitis, are named as defendants in the suit as well. All defendants in Grant’s lawsuit have denied all wrongdoing. Attorneys for Vince McMahon and WWE did not respond to The 19th’s request for comment.
When it comes to the allegations of sexual assault against both Trump and McMahon, Reinhard said she sees “the double whammy of the toxic masculinity that still accepts and promotes — something we are seeing more of now since Trump won — the idea that women are supposed to be controlled and then the idea that if you’ve got the money and you’ve got the time, you’re able to essentially spend your way out of these allegations, spend your way out of any charges and essentially wait out the public debate until people forget about it.” 
The feelings
Both Trump and professional wrestling are massive cultural entities that allow men to express their emotions, especially about their own masculinity. In the ring and now in the White House, men’s feelings matter — especially when it comes to defending their own identities and the men who give them that space to publicly feel and perform. “The idea of emotions being antithetical to politics really needs to be addressed, because they’re not just emotions — they’re a motivating force,” Reinhard said.
In the administration, the feelings lead to policies that promote a world where men can not only feel freely, but control the levers of society to make space for these feelings, too. 
Letting voters get caught up in the fandom makes the unprecedented policy decisions all the more possible. From tariffs that threaten to raise daily costs on voters who say they voted because of the economy, to DOGE cuts resulting in job and program losses that are upending economic security for many, to a proclamation for National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month from a sitting president found liable for sexual abuse in 2023, the second Trump administration has taken to operating in a way that constantly asks constituents to not just accept but actively buy in to a reality that runs counter to the facts on the ground. It’s kayfabe for government: Creating a world for men to freely express emotion and set policies with no limits — and no consequences — for violating once accepted standards and norms.
The second Trump administration is showcasing a “much more extreme” version of the first Trump term’s commitment to “dismantling a particular version of politics on the Hill,” said Sarah Banet-Weiser, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania whose research focuses on gender, media and politics. “And if you dismantle those politics, you know, you have to replace them with something,” Banet-Weiser said. 
And what remains is a stoking of men’s feelings in the wake of a slew of public policy decisions that in turn provoke even more emotion — even when the feelings run counter to the facts. The difference between reality television as entertainment and reality television as a political system is the consequences, Banet-Weiser said. “It’s not a group of housewives who fight and are riddled with scandal and then go on with their lives. It’s about the livelihoods of the American people.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Welcome to The Topline, a weekly roundup of the big numbers driving the Minnesota news cycle, as well as the smaller ones that you might have missed. This week: green cities; a stunning decline in Black homeownership; America’s most polluted air; an unusually long stretch without homicides; and Minnesota’s most conservative county. 
The greenest cities (literally)
The Washington Post has used data from the Arbor Day Foundation and the U.S. Forest Service to map tree cover across the country’s urban areas. Tree cover is primarily a function of the local climate — they grow readily in areas that were naturally forested before the arrival of Europeans, and less so in places like deserts.
More than half of Atlanta is covered by trees, for instance. Less than 9% of Phoenix is.
But policy plays a role too, and some cities are taking steps to plant more of them for a variety of reasons, including their cooling effect on the urban environment. 
Here in Minnesota, where the eastern forests meet the central prairie, you can see the gradient in canopy cover as you drive west. Duluth, for instance, is about 40% trees. Minneapolis-St. Paul is closer to 30%. Less than 15% of Fargo-Moohead has tree cover.
Black homeownership nosedives
A recent report by the Minnesota State Demographic Center shows that the overall rate of homeownership since 1970 has held steady at roughly 72%. But there has been a precipitous decline in Black homeownership over the same period.
In 1970, for instance, 42% of Black families were homeowners. In 2022 just 26% were. 
“In other words, since the 1970s, Black or African American householders have been increasingly concentrated into rental housing units,” according to the analysis. “This is a historical trend unique to Black or African American households.” The decline has been consistent across every decade except the 1990s. 
Another interesting wrinkle: The decline happening almost exclusively among U.S.-born Black families. Among Black immigrants, homeownership rates increased. 
The numbers suggest that Minnesota’s well-known racial disparities, among the worst in the nation, owe more to Black families falling behind than to white ones getting ahead. The fact that Minnesota-born Black families seem to be doing worse than their new immigrant counterparts is especially damning, and a sign that policymakers’ efforts to address the state’s disparities are failing.
America’s most air-polluted places
They’re mostly in California, according to the American Lung Association’s latest State of the Air report. But a couple Midwestern cities also make the list, including Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis and Cleveland.
The study finds, overall, that nearly half of the U.S. breathes in unhealthy levels of air pollution. 
“Air pollution is causing kids to have asthma attacks, making people who work outdoors sick, and leading to low birth weight in babies,” said Harold Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association. “This year’s report shows the dramatic impact that air pollution has on a growing number of people.”
The findings are especially concerning this year as the Trump administration is taking steps to both weaken federal regulations on air pollutants and to stop collecting much of the data that scientists use to track air pollution around the world.
Minneapolis posts longest stretch without a homicide in more than eight years
The 62 days between February 15 and April 18 mark the longest homicide-free stretch in Minneapolis since at least 2017, the Star Tribune reports. It’s a nice little milestone but bear in mind that homicides are currently falling virtually everywhere in the country, making it difficult to ascribe Minneapolis’ recent dry spell to any particular policy or policing decision.
So far this year, Minneapolis homicides are down by more than 50% from where they were last year at this time. That’s an impressive number, but it remains to be seen whether it’s the start of a durable trend or just the reflection of the regular ebb and flow of violent crime.
Minnesota’s most conservative county
It’s Morrison County in north-central Minnesota, population 34,000, per the Star Tribune. More than 70% of the county’s voters picked Donald Trump in the last three elections, and the overwhelming majority of them remain pleased with their pick despite the economic chaos he’s already caused.
Morrison is virtually all white and in the bottom fifth of the state for household income. Several of the voters who spoke with the Star Tribune appear to be deeply misinformed on basic facts about American society. 
One government employee, who believes antifa was behind Jan. 6 and who is indefinitely postponing building a new home because of Trump’s policies, told the paper he remains 100% devoted to the billionaire convicted felon in the White House: “He’s me, just at a lot bigger level.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1468619438.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The North Carolina Supreme Court seemed to side with the agriculture lobby last Wednesday in a hearing for a case whose outcome could nullify key environmental, civil rights and public health protections for neighbors of the state’s 2,000 industrialized livestock farms.
If the justices uphold an appellate court’s decision in favor of the N.C. Farm Bureau Federation, the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality would not be allowed to enforce three provisions in the state’s general permits for concentrated animal feeding operations that were forged as part of a civil rights settlement.
Instead, those three requirements for certain farms—groundwater monitoring, annual reporting and soil testing for phosphorus loss—would have to go through a more extensive rule-making process led by the Environmental Management Commission.
The EMC is composed of political appointees, whose appetite for regulation varies.
“This case presents a foundational question of administrative accountability whether state agencies may sidestep the safeguards of rulemaking by imposing sweeping regulatory mandates through general permits,” the Farm Bureau Federation attorneys wrote in court documents.
The case stems from several settlement conditions contained within a 2014 civil rights complaint. Lawyers for several environmental justice groups and neighbors of industrialized hog farms had filed a complaint with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, alleging that DEQ, by issuing general permits without adequate protections, disproportionately burdened people of color and low-income residents, who are more likely to live near the farms.
Most of the state’s concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, hold a general permit, which applies to a class of operations. A smaller number have individual permits, whose conditions are tailored to specific farms. DEQ renews and, if necessary, revises general permits every five years, after several public hearings and opportunities to comment.
As part of the settlement, DEQ incorporated three conditions in a 2019 general permit.

All CAFOs must file a two-page annual report summarizing information from existing records, such as the number of animals, permitted lagoons and acres on which waste is applied.
CAFOs whose lagoons or waste collection systems lie within a 100-year flood plain must conduct annual groundwater monitoring; this accounts for fewer than 3 percent of general permit holders, according to DEQ.
Based on soil testing, some CAFOs would have to measure phosphorus loss from their fields where animal waste is applied. This requirement would affect roughly 5 percent of CAFOs.

Groundwater monitoring is important because runoff or leakage from enormous hog waste lagoons can seep into private drinking water wells or rivers and streams. Annual reporting, environmental groups argued, can detect problems at the CAFOs sooner.
Phosphorus loss tests are key because they can indicate erosion or runoff from the farms, which in turn can create harmful algae blooms in waterways.
  This map shows the locations of all permitted concentrated animal feeding operations in North Carolina. In total, these farms raise 86,000 cattle and cows, 9.45 million swine, and 7.19 million poultry where the animal waste is stored and applied as a liquid. The map does not show the millions of poultry on farms that use dry waste systems; those farms aren’t required to obtain a permit. (Credit: N.C. Department of Environmental Quality)
The N.C. Farm Bureau Federation contested those aspects of the general permit before an administrative law judge, who ruled in its favor.
DEQ appealed to Wake County Superior Court, which reversed the administrative law judge’s ruling. The Farm Bureau subsequently won in state appellate court.
For 28 years the state legislature has enacted and revised statutes allowing DEQ and other agencies to write and issue general permits without going through rulemaking, a process that can take years.
Only if a provision has “general applicability” does it need to be a rule.
Associate Justice Trey Allen, a Republican, agreed that state lawmakers granted some permitting authority to state agencies, but said “it’s difficult for me to believe GA’s intent was to enable the agency to avoid rulemaking.”
“These permit conditions do not have general applicability,” said Taylor Crabtree, an attorney with the N.C. Department of Justice representing DEQ. Even though the permits are “general,” farmers can apply for an individual permit instead, Crabtree said, and potentially avoid the three provisions in dispute.
State law also requires every requirement in a general permit to tie back to a specific condition or statute, which the three provisions achieve, Crabtree said.
DEQ’s actions for the three provisions, Republican Associate Judge Richard Dietz said, “sound like rulemaking.”
Dietz said that while the legislature has the authority to delegate some rulemaking to the executive branch, such as DEQ, that power has limits, such as procedural safeguards.
A farm can still challenge the permit conditions in court, Crabtree told the justices. “It’s not accurate to say this regime has no procedural safeguards.”
Jacob Parker, attorney for the Farm Bureau Federation, argued without the guardrails of formal rule-making, “an agency can go off into its black box and make decisions” about what to include in permits, “which we contend is what sort of happened here with the sue and settle issue.”
The “sue and settle issue” is the 2014 civil rights complaint against DEQ, which the EPA determined was valid. The EPA directed DEQ and environmental groups to enter confidential mediation, but those talks broke down in 2016, when agency officials in a conservative administration allowed the NC Pork Council to attend a confidential mediation session. ??
Attorneys for the neighbors and environmental groups asked the pork industry representatives to leave the building. Instead they stayed in the hallway near the mediation room during the talks, according to a second complaint, a move that neighbors alleged was a form of intimidation.
The EPA found the second complaint to be valid and wrote in a letter to DEQ that it had “grave concerns” about the incidents.
Two years later, under new DEQ Secretary Michael Regan, the parties reached a settlement. Regan went on to become EPA administrator under President Joe Biden.
Parker, the Farm Bureau Federation attorney, told the court today that “absent the farm interests, we ended up with a draft swine permit with conditions that had not been adopted as rules.” Unlike rules, the conditions contained no fiscal note, so farmers didn’t know how much compliance would cost, Parker said.
Associate Justice Anita Earls, one of two Democrats on the bench, asked about the possible ramifications on DEQ’s other 21 general permits as well as all state agencies. “If we were to say the conditions for the permitting process here have to go through rulemaking … would these extend beyond DEQ?”
Crabtree, the DEQ attorney, replied that if the scope of the opinion is broad, it could affect all state agencies that issue general permits. “It would work a great deal of uncertainty into the system,” Crabtree said. In that case, any statutory clarifications should fall to state lawmakers, he said. “If there’s a change, it’s an argument for the General Assembly, not the courts.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hog-Farm-eastern-NC-Rick-Dove-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

SPRINGFIELD – The cost to attend state universities has been rising, and some institutions have said they’ll have to continue pushing the brunt of state budget shortfalls onto students and families if there isn’t a change.

Data from the Illinois Board of Higher Education, which oversees public universities, shows university income has had to make up for the steady loss of funding from the state since around fiscal year 2009 as compared to inflation.

Since that point, state investment hasn’t kept up with inflation, and tuition and fees have risen steadily despite the fact that Gov. JB Pritzker’s administration has regularly increased higher education funding. The fiscal year 2026 proposed budget includes a 3% increase for higher education in the general fund for operating costs – which is about the same as the rate of inflation.

The cost of tuition and fees for statewide undergraduates on average has risen 10% higher since FY09 than if it had simply kept pace with inflation. For graduate students, that discrepancy is 16%.

The University of Illinois Chicago is the only school that has seen tuition and fees for both graduate and undergraduate students grow more slowly than inflation.

Administrators from many of the states’ universities have said they’re holding out hope that a new funding formula, contained in Senate Bill 13 and House Bill 1581, will alleviate some financial burden.

The formula as it is currently proposed would use data from the Illinois Board of Higher Education to determine how much money public universities would need on a per-student basis. University officials said the current system for allocating funds to universities isn’t quite as clear about determining why one university gets more funding than any other.

During a Senate appropriations hearing last week, Sen. Michael Halpin, D-Rock Island, and Northern Illinois University President Lisa Freeman each supported a data-based funding formula over the current method.

Administrators for almost every public state university who have spoken to the same committee have said they need to keep asking for more money than what the governor proposed in order to fend off tuition and fee increases.

“We understand funds are more constrictive this year than in the recent past,” said Eastern Illinois University President Jay Gatrell during the committee meeting. “That said, we do have bills to pay, and we only have two real sources of revenue: state appropriations, which cover roughly one-third of our operating costs, and student tuition and fees, which cover the remaining two-thirds.”

During fiscal year 2003, that breakdown was flipped – the state covered more than two-thirds of universities’ operating costs.

“No university really wants to increase tuition cost,” said Corey Bradford, interim president of Governors State University in an interview. “We do it in order to balance our budgets.”

The proposed funding formula hasn’t made its way through either chamber yet, though legislators generally have ways of moving major legislation beyond stated bill deadlines, up until end-of-May adjournment. If it doesn’t move, universities will continue being appropriated funds by standards set from years past.

“Even if there are differences in dollars per FTE (full time equivalency student) after we were to implement this formula, at least those differences would be grounded in this data in the program,” Halpin said. “Right now, we have these discrepancies, but there’s … not necessarily a hard data point, or set of data points, to justify it.”

 

MAP grants

In his February budget plan, Pritzker proposed increased funding of $10 million for Monetary Award Program grants for students to use toward tuition and fees, matching the same increase he made for the previous year’s budget.

MAP grants can go to any student who’s eligible for financial aid across the state. Pritzker’s proposed increase would make the new MAP grants pool total $721.6 million – up from $400 million when he was first elected in 2019.

However, MAP grants don’t directly fund universities the same way money from the general fund does.

“MAP goes to all colleges,” Bradford said. “Community colleges, private colleges, it doesn’t all come to public universities.”

 

University building projects

Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, asked every university president during recent committee hearings if their schools had received any funding for deferred maintenance projects on campuses for the current fiscal year.

Rose said no one has said “yes” yet.

“I think we’d like to know before we get to next year’s budget how we’re spending last year’s budget,” Rose said. The current budget year concludes on June 30.

Ginger Ostro, IBHE’s executive director, said the board is working with universities and meeting with them and the Illinois Capital Development Board to maintain lists about deferred maintenance projects and make sure funding is distributed.

Proponents of Senate Bill 2 from Sen. “Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, leaned on data and research that blames fluoride for thyroid disorders and lowering the IQ of children (we’ll circle back to that later). The proposal advanced last Wednesday from the Senate Committee of Health and Welfare in a 6-3 party line vote, with Republicans prevailing. 
The results were the same for another Fesi bill to authorize the over-the-counter sale of ivermectin at pharmacies without a doctor’s prescription. As with the anti-fluoride bill, ivermectin supporters had ample info to support their viewpoint (we’ll get back to this, too).
Yet despite this apparent pro-science and pro-research mindset, overwhelming evidence of higher rates of cancer and other chronic ailments in communities along the Mississippi River’s petrochemical corridor in Louisiana are routinely ignored – if not doubted – within conservative circles.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Just three years ago, a peer-reviewed Tulane Environmental Law Clinic study found the estimated cancer risk was highest in the River Parish communities right next to point sources of pollution. Most of these settlements are predominantly Black and low-income, inhabited in part by the descendants of slaves who toiled on the plantations where refineries and chemical plants now stand.
The same study found the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) issued permits to allow industrial pollution emissions at rates 7 to 21 times higher among Black communities than in predominantly white ones. 
According to 2024 health data research from Human Rights Watch, people living in areas with the worst air pollution in Louisiana, including much of “Cancer Alley,” had rates of low birthweight more than double the state average (11.3%) and more than triple the U.S. average (8.5%). Preterm births were nearly double the state average (13%) and nearly two-and-a-half times the national rate (10.5%).
State officials are not willing to acknowledge the disparities. 
“LDEQ does not use the term Cancer Alley,” a department spokesperson told Human Rights Watch last year. “That term implies that there is a large geographic area that has higher cancer incidence than the state average. We have not seen higher cancer incidence over large areas of the industrial corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans.”
Now let’s go back to last week’s Senate committee hearing to see if we can’t connect that statement to why state officials can’t – or won’t – acknowledge verified scientific facts that are staring them in the face.
That includes state Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham, who was by Fesi’s side to support both of his bills. Regarding the removal of fluoride from drinking water, Abraham said there “probably is a direct correlation between fluoride intake in pregnant ladies and lower IQs in their babies.” Crowley chiropractor Sandra Marks, who also testified in favor of the bill, made the same claim and cited a Harvard School of Public Health study.
What Abraham and Marks didn’t share was that the Harvard study involved children in China with high overexposure to fluoride. They implied the lower IQs were tied to exposure to permissible levels of fluoride in the U.S. 
Jeanie Donovan, New Orleans deputy health department director, shared details on the Harvard research with lawmakers when testifying against Fesi’s bill. She also pointed out the lack of any reliable scientific research that connects fluoride with thyroid disease. 
“We have many, many health issues in our city and in our state that we should address and that we should be spending time and money to address,” Donovan told the committee, making it clear that fluoride overexposure was not one of them. 
Anne Jayes with the Louisiana Public Health Institute and Dr. Robert Delarosa, a Baton Rouge pediatric dentist for 41 years, both cited a University of Queensland study that found children with access to properly fluoridated water had higher IQs. 
Marks, who said her research was sourced through Meta AI, also sounded the alarm over skeletal fluorosis, which can result in bone density changes and an increased risk of fractures. What she failed to mention was the bone disorder involves exposure to excessive amounts of fluoride. 
Jayes later pointed out the potentially dangerous fluoride levels in the study Marks cited were 21 to 28 times the recommended amount for drinking water systems, and that skeletal fluorosis studies themselves have been “widely challenged for their poor quality.”    
Annette Droddy, executive director of the 1,900-member Louisiana Dental Association, noted to the committee a trend of states reversing their bans on fluoridated drinking water, including Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Tennessee. 
Calgary, Alberta, removed fluoride from its water in 2011 but restored it in 2023, Droddy said. The reversal came after health officials noted a 700% increase in children hospitalized for dental inflections and abscesses.
In Louisiana, only 39% of the population is provided fluoridated water through their public utility – well below the 72% national average, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Removing fluoride will compound issues for the nearly 500,000 children in Louisiana who don’t see a dentist regularly, even though they qualify for dental coverage through Medicaid, Droddy said. Without fluoridated water, she said the state will have to ask the federal government for more money to cover a likely increase in children’s dental problems.
“Why would we take away the best public health measure of the 20th century?” Droddy said.
Yet Fesi stuck to his guns in his closing statement for Senate Bill 2, doubling down on the debunked low IQ and thyroid claims — and adding autism for good measure without any supporting evidence. 
On Fesi’s other bill, Abraham provided what he called a “guesstimate,” saying “a fairly large percentage of the population of the United States takes ivermectin on a daily basis.”
The most recent number available for daily ivermectin use in the U.S. is 185,550 people, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Hospitals. 
That’s only 0.05% of the national population; it’s not nothing but certainly not “a fairly large percentage” of Americans. That poor grasp of health data might be cause for concern among Abraham’s patients – animal and human.
The surgeon general and other backers of Fesi’s bill frequently mentioned “health freedom” during the Senate committee hearing. That concept apparently doesn’t apply to neighbors of industrial facilities who no doubt would like freedom from toxic exposure linked to chronic ailments and a significantly lowered quality and length of life.
Fesi also referred to fluoride as “toxic waste,” something that communities along the river could probably help him better define.   
If Louisiana leaders are going to pull fluoride out of our drinking water, it stands to reason they should show equal concern for the health of residents in “Cancer Alley.”

It’s hard to believe, but it’s now been nearly six months since the November 2024 election and one race remains officially undecided – the contest for an associate justice seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court. Two recounts have confirmed that incumbent Justice Allison Riggs was the narrow victor, but remarkably, challenger Jefferson Griffin refuses to concede and continues to pursue the audacious strategy of seeking to have thousands of ballots – ballots cast according to the rules in effect on Election Day – thrown out.
The challenge has led to multiple lawsuits and numerous state and federal court rulings and recently, in order to try and get a handle on where things stand, what’s at stake and what might happen next, NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with one of our state’s top good government champions, Common Cause of North Carolina Policy Director, Ann Webb.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University


GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Two volunteers pretend to cook over a stove when another pair acting as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents comes knocking at the cardboard cutout of a door.
This is the set up for a skit that undocumented advocates put on at their Know Your Rights training sessions. Rojas helps organize them.
“I am committed to waking my people up so they know that he, she or they can share with others their rights,” Rojas said.
Rojas is an immigrant who is actively involved with the undocumented community in her city. She’s asked to not use her full name for the safety of herself and the undocumented community she works with.
She’s worried because of recent allegations that federal immigration officers have wrongfully detained residents in New England and beyond. At Boston Logan Airport recently, two people with legal immigration status were detained. One had a green card and was detained. The other had a legal work visa and was deported.
“It makes me nervous,” Rojas said in Spanish. “It makes me think of how we can be even more strategic with these kinds of attacks.”
Part of that strategy is teaching people their constitutional rights, because she said it’s now more important than ever for people to know how to use them if they ever interact with an ICE agent.
“Being out and about is scary, but I am committed to planting those seeds, because I know they’ll bloom,” Rojas said.
Blah-blah-blah, cha-cha-cha and practice
The Know Your Rights workshop Rojas and her fellow activists put on has three parts. She calls them the “blah, blah, blah”, the “cha, cha, cha” and then “practice, practice, practice.”
The “blah, blah, blah” is a lecture in which activists explicitly tell audience members their rights. The New Haven Immigrants Coalition has a slideshow presentation with the majority of the constitutional rights that Rojas goes over in her own presentation. It is available in English and Spanish.
Trainees then get to see these rights in action with skits, during the “cha, cha, cha” portion of the workshop.
“The skit is a theatrical way to get as close as we can to reality and to expose our trainees in different scenarios so they can think about it, feel about it, and then practice it,” Rojas said.

Scenarios include what to do when you are at home, in your car, at your workplace and when you’re in a public area.
Rojas and her team provide handout copies of a legitimate court-ordered warrant signed by a judge and an ICE administrative order. With an administrative order, you do not need to open the door, Rojas said, but it is a common tactic immigration agents use to gain entry into someone’s home, so it’s important to know the distinction.
“If [the ICE agents] come with different tricks, just don’t fall for it,” Rojas said. “If [the agents] say, ‘We have here a document that proves that we can get into your house.’ [You should say] ‘Okay, just slide it [under] the door.’”
Then comes “practice, practice, practice.”
Rojas has all the trainees line up in pairs with partners facing each other. With one person as themselves and the other person as an ICE agent, they’ll practice the skills they’ve learned using different scenarios that Rojas poses.
The ‘each one teach one’ approach
This April, Rojas’ advocacy group is starting a new program called “Train the Trainer.” The idea is to train people how to give these Know Your Rights workshops.
“This is intended to be in the safety of your house,” she said. Imagine it like a gathering, she said, where Mexican sweet corn cake and coffee is served.
“We are going to have tomalitos, café and know your rights,” Rojas said. The goal is to offer training sessions to people who are too afraid to go out in public.
“Can you imagine if we can train 40 people this time, and then the next session, they invite one, just one, one of the people that they train to come to another ‘Train the Trainer?’ Now we are going to have 80 people,” she said. “It makes a huge difference.”
Prepare a layered defense
At Castle Church in Norwich, Philip Berns was giving a Know Your Rights presentation with the Latino advocacy group LEAD late into the night in March. The people in the audience either spoke English, Spanish or Haitian Creole. Thankfully, Berns speaks all three languages.
Berns, an immigration attorney based in Stamford, has been giving Know Your Rights presentations since 2006. When President Donald Trump returned to office, Berns ramped up to offer about two presentations a week.
He likes to teach people a strategy for how to use a red card (la tarjeta roja). Think of it like a business card, but instead of your contact information, it has your constitutional rights listed. You can give it to an immigration agent if you’re unable to verbally state your rights, he said.
Holding a “red card,” attorney Philip Berns of Stamford speaks during a community meeting held at Castle Church in Norwich, March 4, 2025. The “red cards,” which were distributed at the event, describe rights guaranteed by the US Constitution to protect people that could be targeted by ICE officials. Credit: Mark Mirko / Connecticut Public
He recommends having at least six red cards on hand at all times and to give them out to each agent you interact with, but he said you should save the last one for the deportation judge to show that if you were detained, it was done while violating your constitutional rights.
“You just have to be ready to have a layered defense,” Berns said.
Knowing which of your rights were violated is the best way to defend yourself when facing a deportation judge if you end up detained, which is why, Berns said, Know Your Rights training is still “absolutely” important regardless of the cases of alleged wrongful detentions.
It also helps to have a video recording of the interaction with the immigration agent, Berns said, another right that Berns teaches people they have.
“They’re going to take your phone away from you, so you’re not gonna be able to record it yourself,” he said. “It’s going to have to be other people.”
That’s where bystanders can act as allies, he said.
Open the door to your community
Both Berns and Rojas agree that these workshops are not just for the undocumented. They’re for family members, friends and neighbors, regardless of immigration status.
“If you know your rights, you know that you don’t have to open the door, and that is the single biggest line of defense you have against [ICE agents] picking up anybody they’re looking for,” Berns said. “For all the other people in the house that [the ICE agents] are not looking for, but I suspect will likely pick up just to drive their numbers up, if they know their rights, then they can protect themselves against deportation [too].”
In Spanish, Rojas and her fellow activists have a saying.
“Close the door on ICE,” she said. “Open the door to your community.”

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Norman served as secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment throughout the pandemic. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Five years ago, Lee Norman was trying to dissuade Kansans from ingesting chemical cleaners to prevent COVID-19, preparing for the end of a statewide stay-at-home order and deciding whether to send tests for everyone in long-term care facilities and prisons.
Norman, then secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, jokes that reflecting on those years is like taking “a walk down bad memory lane.”
“We were meeting 24/7, 365,” Norman said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “And trying to figure out — without having enough resources, without having (a) vaccine, without having any medications and without having any testing — what the heck we were going to do with this lethal virus that has now landed in the United States.”


Within two years of the first cases in Kansas, Norman stepped down from his cabinet post at the request of Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration.
The first case was recorded March 7, 2020, and about a week later, Kelly declared a state of emergency.
Less than a week after that, she ordered K-12 schools closed.
By the end of the month, national case counts inched toward 100,000, deaths reached 1,000, President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus bill and Kelly issued a stay-at-home order for the entire state.
The first four weeks went “swimmingly well,” even amid uncertainty and shock, Norman said.
But, he said, things quickly became contentious as executive action from the governor, public health recommendations and attempts at understanding a brand new virus unfolded.
“You know, four weeks was pretty unusual to have that kind of engagement,” he said. “And after that, it became distinctly unfun.”
He admitted public health was slow to address the social and psychological impacts of the pandemic. But by the point he and other public health officials realized that, he said, resistance to following public health guidance had already begun to take shape.
The politicization that crept into Norman’s role during the COVID-19 pandemic still exists in public health today. The 2025 Kansas Legislature passed bills in April that hinder the governor’s authority to limit public gatherings and pare back vaccination requirements for children.
Norman, who now works in the private sector, said investing in public health infrastructure is key for preparing for future health crises.
As Kansans faced last year a spike in tuberculosis cases and more recently a growing measles outbreak, Norman emphasized the importance of vaccinations and adhering to public health guidance.
The governor signed into law in April modifications to vaccine requirements for children that make it easier for parents to claim religious exemptions as justification for their unvaccinated children. The governor vetoed another piece of legislation that created a pathway for people to sue state and county health officials for their decisions about quarantines and other public health guidance. The Legislature overrode Kelly’s veto, making the change law.
Masks and limiting large gatherings work, Norman said. They have for centuries, he added.
“Half of everybody, kind of wants to undo the benefits of public health, and mock it even, which is particularly hurtful,” Norman said. “I think that the Legislature needs to, one, respect personal autonomy and responsibility, and then secondly, if people are want to have more autonomy, I think they have to listen to very, very good guidance.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PC303579-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

A few weeks after the birth, the two were temporarily separated. Hailey poses for a portrait after being temporarily reunited with her daughter on April 1 in Cuba. Asked what she misses most, Hailey replied: “Her smiling.” (Photo by Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent)CUBA, Mo. — Hailey cradled her cat like a baby and nuzzled his fur. It wasn’t long before he rejected the attention and leapt from her arms in the callous way cats do. She cursed him in the way hormonal teenagers do.
Ash, a gray stray Hailey took in against her great-aunt’s protesting, became the teen’s comfort through a pregnancy and postpartum that spanned 10 foster homes, hospitals and group homes across Missouri.
Hailey entered the state foster system at 2 years old. She’s lost count of how many roofs she’s slept under.
Last spring at 15 years old, Hailey learned she was pregnant.
When she asked the state for an abortion, Hailey was told the possibility wasn’t up for discussion. By the time her stomach started to bulge, Missourians voted to codify the right to abortion in the state Constitution, and Hailey decided she wanted to parent.
But it wasn’t so simple.
By then, Hailey was staying with her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, but the state remained her legal guardian. Though Hailey took initiative to prepare for motherhood, caseworkers on several occasions during her pregnancy threatened to take the baby after she was born, rolling out examples from Hailey’s long history in the state’s care.
In late February, just a few weeks after Hailey turned 16, her daughter was born. The resemblance is unmistakable: vibrant red locks, pale skin and blue eyes.
From the moment her baby girl entered the world, Hailey feared the state would take her. While that hasn’t happened permanently, the state did temporarily separate the young mother and child, moving them to different cities in different corners of the state.
By eight weeks postpartum, Hailey had slept in two hospitals and four homes.
Desperate to reunite her child with family as she was shuffled around the foster system, Hailey signed power of attorney of her daughter over to Spradley, to whom she also wanted to return.
In early April, after months of protesting the state’s push to move her into a faith-based maternity home, Hailey acquiesced. It allowed her to reunite with her daughter.
A few weeks later, on the eve of a court hearing to discuss her permanent placement, Hailey ran away from the maternity home with her 6-week-old in her arms. Both were quickly found and returned to state custody.
Hailey said she fled, in part, out of fear the state would officially declare she couldn’t live with Spradley. And she was terrified about where they might send her next.
The family’s fate remains uncertain.
Missouri has long been one of the most anti-abortion states in the country, with elected officials and advocates preaching the virtue of supporting young mothers to ensure abortion isn’t their only option.
But Hailey said this sentiment is a far cry from her experience. To her, it felt like the state first made the decision to continue the pregnancy for her, then actively worked to keep her from parenting her child.
The Independent spent months following Hailey and reviewing communications between her, Spradley, their advocates and the state that spanned Hailey’s pregnancy and postpartum.
The record of her struggles in the system illustrate what youth advocates and foster care experts say are repeated failures by the state to support Hailey, and later her daughter.
“Hailey was saying she wanted to parent, so she should have been supported,” said Laura Sullivan, a licensed independent social worker in Ohio who has spent several months advocating for Hailey. “In these states where they’re forcing pregnancies, especially teen pregnancies, they have to be ready to help these moms to parent.”
A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services, which oversees the state foster care system, said she could not discuss the specifics of Hailey’s case, instead pointing to Missouri’s Child Welfare Manual.
 ‘Don’t get pregnant’

The Facebook message came from a stranger.
“I have a child on my caseload who I believe is a relative to you,” an employee with a Missouri foster care agency wrote the morning of May 21, 2024.
Within hours, the state cleared and authorized Spradley to take her niece in under a temporary arrangement. Hailey was on her doorstep by that evening.
A letter dated that same day stated that while Hailey remained in the custody of Children’s Division, she was being placed with Spradley for an “indeterminate period.”
Though filled with gaps, the aunt and niece have a long history. Spradley used to take Hailey to the St. Louis Zoo, propping her up against the wooden railings to catch a glimpse of the animals. As Hailey got older, Spradley would take her driving around different corners of southeast Missouri to get ice cream or go to a park.
At times they went years without seeing one another. Though another great-aunt of Hailey’s — Spradley’s sister — adopted Hailey when she was 4, Hailey spent much of her childhood shuffled between different foster homes and mental hospitals.

She was a flight risk almost everywhere she went until she landed at Spradley’s.
“Don’t get pregnant,” Hailey recalled Spradley telling her when she moved in.
A few weeks later, Hailey went to the doctor to confirm what she feared. Hailey, who only a few months earlier had turned 15, was pregnant.
She wanted an abortion in the beginning. When Hailey asked her case worker if it was possible, she was told the state wasn’t allowed to discuss it with her. Abortion at the time remained illegal in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies.
Hailey couldn’t get up the nerve to tell Spradley she was pregnant, so she made a friend break the news instead. But Spradley didn’t kick her out. She doubled down on her desire to help.
Spradley searched the internet for answers. She sent a note to JustChoice — an agency based out of Ohio that helps people create abortion, adoption or parenting plans — saying her niece had been denied an abortion and now wanted to raise her child.
There was just one problem, Spradley said: Though months from her due date, the state was already threatening to take away Hailey’s baby.
 ‘We’re going to remove that baby’

Sullivan, the licensed independent social worker at JustChoice, reached out to Spradley after her organization received her message in late 2024. With Spradley’s permission, she started communicating with Hailey’s case worker to talk about a parenting plan.
Sullivan recalls the case worker in their initial calls telling her: “I don’t think Hailey’s going to be able to parent. We’re going to remove that baby. Her and her aunt, this is not a stable situation; they have a long history with the agency.’”
Most urgent, the case worker told Sullivan, was Spradley’s lack of adequate housing. If she wanted to maintain custody of Hailey through her pregnancy, she needed somewhere else to live.
After staying with a friend in St. Louis, Spradley and Hailey moved into the home and church of a former pastor in Wright City. Some of Spradley’s friends had pointed them to the old building off a rural highway as emergency accommodations.
The house, which abutted woods and farmland, sat untouched after the pastor died months earlier.
In the main room, religious relics crowded the wall. Behind one closed door was what Hailey dubbed the “porn room,” after they found explicit images on an abandoned computer. Hailey slept upstairs beneath old posters of semi trucks plastered to the walls.
The lack of heat became a growing concern as winter approached.
The state began talking of removing Hailey from Spradley’s care; a faith-based maternity home in the St. Louis suburbs that contracts with the state was suggested. Hailey remained adamant she didn’t want to go. When her case worker recommended she have bags packed and by the door the week of Christmas, she listened.
But she also shut down, growing moodier as the looming threat of removal hung over the holidays.
The new year came and went. Hailey’s bags remained by the door. The state never stopped by.
Sullivan, searching for a solution, teamed up with Right By You, an “all options” nonprofit focused on helping pregnant youth, to raise money for Spradley to rent an upgraded apartment.
Within weeks, Right By You raised $5,000 — primarily through Missouri donors and abortion funds — to cover Spradley’s rent through May. Meanwhile, Sullivan worked the phones with Spradley, calling landlords in an attempt to find someone who would accept a pregnant teen, a 52-year-old on disability, two dogs and one cat.
She found a solution in Cuba, a town about 80 miles southwest of St. Louis.
By mid-January, Hailey and Spradley were moved into a small, unadorned two-bedroom apartment.
Spradley reached out to her network of friends, asking if they could help furnish the apartment with baby essentials as a birthday surprise for Hailey, who turned 16 in late January.
They came by the truck-load, dropping off strollers, onesies and a swing. Spradley used some of the disability back-pay she received to splurge on a crib and a bottle sanitizer.
In the end, it still wasn’t enough.
 ‘Where are you going to live?’

Spradley didn’t take Hailey in sooner for many reasons. Poverty and poor health were the most prevailing.
“So what’s your plan for where you are going to live?” Hailey’s case worker asked in a text to Spradley months earlier, shortly after Hailey learned she was pregnant. “Do you have any money saved?”
“I had absolutely no income when Hailey was brought to me,” Spradley replied. “Not a dime. I get SSI disability which is very little.”
But once together, Hailey didn’t want to leave. Finally, someone understood her — a sarcastic and brash teen with a tendency to raise her voice.
“Some people would see what she’s doing and would freak out, but they don’t understand what she’s grown up and what she’s went through,” Spradley said. “That’s why I don’t judge her on that. That’s the big difference between me and other people.”
Unlike a foster parent, Spradley didn’t receive consistent financial benefits from the state for taking Hailey in. Though she attempted on several occasions to get certified as a foster parent through the state, she never received the final approval.
Spradley suspects it’s because she’s poor and sick.
She’s often seized by anxiety, which she said has only worsened since beginning to navigate the state’s hurdles in her attempts to help Hailey. She suffers from agoraphobia, Crohn’s disease, heart conditions and often uses a walker.
Spradley attributed some of her ailments to growing up in Times Beach, Missouri. It’s now a ghost town, beset by a chemical contamination that came to light in the 1980s. The Environmental Protection Agency deemed it “one of the worst environmental disasters in our nation’s history.”
Hailey is as determined as her aunt.
She enrolled in teen parenting classes through Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis as she started her second trimester. Between that and her prenatal appointments, she made weekly trips to St. Louis through her third trimester.
Most weeks, she made the trip without Spradley, booking and boarding a van through MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid program. The vehicle usually picked up other patients along the way, stretching what was normally a 90-minute drive into multiple hours.
The state on several occasions expressed concern with this arrangement, telling both Spradley and Sullivan that Hailey needed constant supervision.
Instead, Spradley kept an eye on Hailey’s location from an app on her cell phone.
Every year, Missouri social services agencies seize millions of dollars in Social Security benefits from foster children. Hailey is among them.
When Sullivan questioned how the state was using Hailey’s payments, which typically go toward funding foster care, she was told it was being used to pay for Medicaid expenses and the van rides.
She remains skeptical. That $400 a month could have gone a long way to help Spradley purchase furniture and buy groceries, both of which she said were held against her toward the end of Hailey’s pregnancy.
 Birth, ‘then I was out’

Days before Hailey went into labor, the state followed through on its threat.
Hailey was removed from Spradley’s apartment in Cuba and sent to a private foster home near St. Louis.
The foster mother, a stranger, drove her to the hospital. Once settled into a room, Hailey said the foster parent told her she was running down to the cafeteria.
Instead, she left Hailey at the hospital and never returned.
Hailey’s daughter was born two days later, on Feb. 26. The moment of joy was brief; within minutes, Hailey lost consciousness.
“I had a whole asthma attack, then I ended up throwing up everything in my stomach, and then shaking so bad that my jaw was hurting,” she said. “Then I was out.”
It took two blood transfusions to stem her postpartum hemorrhage.
Hailey ultimately stayed in the hospital for 12 days. Not because of her health, she said, but because the state didn’t know where else to send her.
This isn’t uncommon. In 2024, there were 314 Missouri foster children residing in hospitals. Others were held in hotels, offices and out-of-state residential treatment facilities.

While at the hospital, Hailey learned how to breastfeed. She believes her daughter shares her own lactose intolerance since she doesn’t take well to most formulas.
In many ways the two girls resemble Hailey’s mother, who was found dead in 2011, two years after Hailey had been removed from her custody. She was in the third trimester of pregnancy with a second daughter, who didn’t survive. The autopsy concluded a drug overdose. Spradley still believes it was something more nefarious.
A few months before Hailey gave birth, she asked Spradley if she could see the place where her mom died. They drove 60 miles to the apartment and asked the current tenant if they could look around. Hailey asked lots of questions. Spradley hoped it was healing.
She tries to tell Hailey stories of her mother often. Like the time Hailey’s mother, while pregnant with her, found a free mini fridge at a scrap sale and walked miles home with it. She later did the same with a kiddie pool.
Hailey doesn’t know her father. She hopes her daughter won’t, either.
The line for “father” on the birth certificate is blank, as Hailey intended.
She says little about the 20-year-old other than that they first met at a foster home years earlier, that he beat her and that he was, for a time, homeless.
Multiple warrants are out for his arrest, including for failure to appear in court on trespassing and theft charges.
Throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, one of Spradley’s closest friends, Brandie Coleman, was among her fiercest defenders. When Hailey gave birth, Coleman was by her side, Facetiming with Spradley, who feared the state might punish her for being there.
As Hailey recovered from her hemorrhage, Coleman says a hospital social worker confided in her that a state case worker had been trying to convince her to report Hailey to child protective services so they could remove her baby. But Coleman says the hospital employee refused, not seeing any evidence of abuse or neglect.
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, the Missouri-based reproductive rights group that helped fundraise for Hailey and Spradley, said the family’s self-advocacy was admirable.
And in a way, she believes, they were punished for it.
She called Hailey’s case “such a blatant example of a pregnancy literally forced by the state, and then a very clear bias against this person and this notion that her child would be better off with a different family, and she was told that explicitly. And I just honestly was a little bit surprised how unveiled that was. There wasn’t really any pretense about it.” 
  Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, called Hailey a “forceful self advocate,” adding: “It’s really admirable for someone so young, who’s in such a disempowered situation.” (Photo by Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent)
Kraft Sheley, who is also an attorney, said the fact that Hailey had a family member who wanted to take her in — who understood her — was huge. That Hailey was deprived of that support in the days leading up to and after her labor was “such inhumanity.”
“For any person to lose their home and be ripped away from their loved one within three days, four days of giving birth, one of the most formative, transformational experiences of a person’s life, she was treated with such a lack of care,” Kraft Sheley said. “… As a teen in such a vulnerable situation, she deserved to be held and surrounded by care, and instead, she was placed in this really precarious, uncertain situation.”
 Postpartum ‘disrupted’

When Hailey was finally discharged from the hospital, she and her baby were driven 200 miles southwest to Springfield.
There, they were placed in a private foster home with other teen moms.
Less than a week later, Hailey called Spradley. She was being taken to a mental health hospital to be screened for postpartum depression. Hailey said she was told it was because the foster parent heard her yelling; Hailey said she was yelling at a friend on the phone, not at her baby.
“I never heard this kid cry like she did,” Spradley said of Hailey during the phone call.
Her daughter was napping when they took Hailey away.
At the hospital, Hailey said she didn’t screen positive for postpartum depression but was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, meaning she has stronger emotional or behavioral responses to stress and trauma.
Hailey said when she learned she was being admitted to the hospital without her daughter, she had to be sedated after she started “throwing hands” at staff. She remained there for six days.
Spradley had little contact with Hailey in the hospital once her phone was taken away. When Hailey was released, she signed power of attorney for her daughter over to Spradley.
As Spradley drove to pick up Hailey’s child, Hailey was taken to yet another location — this time a group home in southeast Missouri.
Hailey believes the separation from her daughter was intentional. Within the first month of her child’s life, the two had been apart nearly as much as they’d been together.
She tried to continue pumping breast milk. At the start of her third trimester, Hailey had already started collecting small bottles of colostrum. But it didn’t take long after being separated from her daughter for her milk supply to diminish.

“For a teen mom, especially one with attachment issues like Hailey has, to be able to breastfeed successfully, that is beautiful and amazing, and could have been really healing,” Sullivan said. “But it was disrupted. So that caused both Hailey harm and (her daughter) harm.”
Sullivan, who has also worked as a social worker in two states, said it’s easy to use a teen’s years-long history in the system against them unfairly. She doesn’t believe Missouri ever gave Hailey a fair chance.
“Instead of being like, ‘This is a kid who we know has a lot of trauma and a lot of stuff, we should probably try to figure out how we’re going to help her parent and heal so she can be a good parent,’” Sullivan said. “‘It was just, ‘We’re on a mission to make her not be able to parent.’”
 ‘I’m not giving up on you’

On a sunny day in early April, Hailey returned to her aunt’s home in Cuba.
For the second time in a week, she held her daughter, who was one day shy of 5 weeks old.
Hailey’s milk supply had mostly dried up. She considered attempting to breastfeed, but then opted to make a bottle instead.
“Has she given you all the stink face yet?” Hailey asked as Spradley confirmed with a chuckle.
“Good. That’s my child,” Hailey replied, smiling down at her daughter as she fed her.
She sat in her old room again, across from stickers adhered to the wall welcoming her baby home. She urged the dogs to be careful as they investigated her baby’s scent. She cuddled her cat.
It was all temporary.

Hailey was back for just part of the day on an authorized off-site visit. A few hours later, Spradley would drive her 90 minutes back to the group home where Hailey would again kiss her baby goodbye.
Until then, she changed diapers, went through paperwork and sorted baby clothes, a sense of normalcy in a life that had been anything but.
As Hailey lounged on the couch with her daughter and Spradley rocked her small dog, named Baby, in the corner, Spradley’s cell phone rang. At the sight of the caller ID, an old friend of Spradley’s, Hailey perked up and grabbed for the phone to say hello.
“You know what? I love the sound of your voice right now. You sound so happy,” Spradley’s friend said to Hailey before pausing. “Honestly, are you doing OK?”
“Not for good, sadly,” Hailey said. “Jodi kidnapped me for the day though.”
She outlined her plan to return permanently to her daughter. The first step was the maternity home she initially resisted. It was her only option she saw to parent.
Less than a week later she checked into the St. Louis area facility. Spradley met her in the lobby with the baby.
The past several months have been hard on Spradley. Anxiety attacks bare themselves in the middle of the night. She worries over Hailey and her daughter. She worries over herself. When she first took in Hailey, there were days she wondered if the stress was too much and if she should send Hailey away. But now, the house feels devastatingly empty without her.
When Hailey was 11 weeks pregnant, she snuck Ash, the cat, into the house against Spradley’s wishes. At the time it infuriated Spradley, who was already having a difficult time feeding two humans and two dogs, making frequent trips to the food pantry. Then she saw how much comfort the cat brought Hailey as she faced an unknown future.
When Hailey was taken away, Spradley started letting the cat sleep beside her at night.
Over the years, Hailey ran from multiple family members and foster homes.
But she never ran from Spradley. It’s something Hailey’s social worker pointed out to Spradley in messages throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, and something Spradley continues to emphasize in her fight to bring Hailey and her daughter back under her roof.

It’s why Spradley wasn’t shocked when she learned at Hailey’s most recent placement hearing in mid-April that she had run away from the maternity home just hours earlier.
“I don’t believe what the system is doing to her… She is a child that’s been in that system for so long that they broke her,” Spradley said the next day, after police located Hailey and her daughter about 130 miles east, in south-central Illinois.
“Sometimes she makes me so mad,” Spradley continued, “but I just can’t blame her for what they did to her. I blame them. I blame the system.”
After Hailey and her daughter were located by the state, they were moved to another foster home, just outside St. Louis.
A few days later, Hailey said her case worker showed up with police, insisting her daughter was underweight and needed to be evaluated at the hospital. Spradley rushed to St. Louis Children’s Hospital to meet them. There, she said doctors gave the baby a clean bill of health and noted she gained weight since the week prior.
Then on Friday, hours after the Missouri Department of Social Services responded to a request for comment on Hailey’s case from The Independent, her case worker called Spradley. The state would soon allow Hailey and her daughter to return to Spradley’s care, at least until a court made a more permanent placement decision, Spradley said.
Despite the sudden good news, nothing about the family’s situation is set in stone.
“I’m scared about what tomorrow’s going to bring,” Spradley said Sunday.
She often reflects on words she spoke to Hailey’s mother not long before she died. Hailey was in a private foster home at the time.
“I promise you I’m going to bring Hailey home,” she said more than a decade ago.
It’s why Spradley didn’t hesitate when Hailey reached out for help. Though when asked about that decision, Hailey, who doesn’t tend toward sentimentality, said, “I knew she’d take my dumb ass.”
She flipped Spradley the bird. Spradley mirrored the motion.
“Me and Hailey, our relationship, even when she has hardships, I’m like, ‘I’m not letting you go,’” Spradley said. “I’m not giving up on you.”
It’s why Hailey chose Spradley to help raise her daughter.
She’s adamant her daughter won’t end up in the state’s care the way she did.
“What they’re doing is f**ked,” Hailey said of her lifetime spent in the foster system.
Spradley is ready to fight right there alongside her niece.
“We want her to experience an actual caring family and have support rather than toss you aside whenever they can’t handle you,” Spradley said. “If they can’t handle you at your worst, then they don’t deserve you at your best, right?”

WASHINGTON — Americans are increasingly unsure what to believe about measles as an outbreak spreads throughout the country, according to a survey released Wednesday by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.
The poll shows that nearly a quarter of those asked believe a commonly repeated false claim that getting a child vaccinated against measles could lead to autism. About the same percentage of those surveyed believe it’s either definitely or probably true that vitamin A can prevent someone from contracting measles, even though it cannot.
And 19% of those surveyed believed untrue statements that the vaccine for measles is more dangerous than contracting the virus.
Parents who believed at least one of the three incorrect claims were more likely to have delayed or skipped some vaccinations for their children. Nearly a quarter, 24%, of those surveyed said they haven’t protected their children via vaccination, more than double the 11% of parents who responded that all three of the false statements about measles were definitely or probably untrue.
 Ongoing outbreak

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that as of late last week there are more than 800 measles diagnoses throughout at least 25 states.
The infections are spread throughout different age groups with 31% of cases in children under five years old, 38% of diagnoses in those between five and 19 years old, 29% in people above the age of 20 and 2% in those with an unknown age, according to the CDC.
Eighty-five patients have been hospitalized and three have died. Nearly all of the confirmed cases, 96%, are in people who have not received the MMR vaccine or who are unsure about their vaccination status, according to the CDC.
States with confirmed cases include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington.
Virginia reported its first case this year over the weekend, though that’s not yet included on the CDC’s website about the ongoing outbreak.
 Understanding linked with concern

KFF’s survey shows that even though there are many people who believe untrue claims about measles or the MMR vaccine — which protects against measles, mumps and rubella — there are higher percentages of people who understand basic facts about the virus and who are concerned about the ongoing outbreak.
Seventy-five percent of those polled said it was incorrect that the MMR vaccine leads to autism, 81% responded it was wrong to say the vaccine is more dangerous than contracting the virus and 75% said it was false that vitamin A can prevent someone from getting measles.
About half, or 51%, of those surveyed said they are at least somewhat concerned about the spread of measles. That worry was highest among Hispanic adults, 62%, and Black adults, 61%.
Most of the people surveyed, 56%, knew that the spread of measles was higher this year than during prior years, though that number varied among people of different political leanings.
Seventy-one percent of Democrats knew that diagnoses of measles have spiked in recent months, compared with 54% of independents and 49% of Republicans.
KFF conducted the survey of 1,380 adults between April 8 and April 15 via telephone and online questions.

Gun regulation has been one of the most hotly contested issues at the North Carolina General Assembly this year.
Lawmakers have introduced bills on a myriad of topics: constitutional carry, handguns at private schools and privacy around concealed carry permits, to name a few.
Permitless concealed carry — known as constitutional carry due to the idea that individuals have the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms without infringement — has drawn the most attention.
Senate Bill 50, Freedom to Carry NC, would allow individuals who are U.S. citizens, at least 18 years of age and not otherwise prohibited by law to carry concealed weapons without applying for a permit.
It’s backed by Republican leadership and would make North Carolina the 30th state to approve of constitutional carry. The bill has passed the Senate and awaits further approval in the House.
Its counterpart in the lower chamber, House Bill 5, or NC Constitutional Carry Act, is largely the same. This measure still needs approval from the House Rules Committee.
The biggest difference in the legislation is that HB 5 would authorize elected officials in the state to carry a concealed firearm “while performing their official duties if the official has a concealed handgun permit.” While the State Capitol and Executive Mansion are excluded from this list, it would be allowed at the State Legislative Building and Legislative Office Building, where lawmakers conduct their business.
States move to outlaw popular ‘Glock switches’ that make some guns fully automatic

North Carolina residents are overwhelmingly opposed to the measures, according to newly released polls. But lawmakers have chosen to move forward.
“There is political play around this policy that is lawmakers in both chambers pandering to the far right extremists and, frankly, being more worried about their own primaries … than they are about the safety of their constituents,” said Monisha Henley, senior vice president for government affairs at Everytown from Gun Safety. “That is why they’ve been trying to push it through the legislature at lightning speed.”
A 2022 study from the Crime Prevention Research Center looked at changes in crime and killings of police after adopting constitutional carry. Using data from 13 states, researchers found that the drop in murder is statistically significant, but the change in violent crime is not.
Paul Valone, president of the Grass Roots North Carolina gun rights group, has spent decades working on the issue. He’s modeled his advocacy after legislation in Vermont, the first state that didn’t have restrictions requiring permits for concealed carry.
“SB 50 and HB 5 are not perfect bills, but they’re what’s achievable right now,” Valone said. “Those of us who have spent a lot of time in the movement believe that because we lost our rights over generations incrementally, we will probably have to win them back incrementally.”
The movement has spread to schools. House Bill 193, Firearm Law Revisions, authorizes individuals with a valid concealed handgun permit to possess or carry a handgun on educational property owned, used, or operated by a private school.
The bill’s wording would allow anybody lawfully entitled to carry a concealed weapon to do so on the premises of a private school below the college level, with written permission from the school. This could be school officials, teachers, and even students.
“This bill endangers students, it endangers teachers, and people don’t want it,” Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) said during a committee hearing. “You’re telling the teachers of North Carolina that we don’t really care what you say.”
Coming up Tuesday, members of the House Judiciary 2 committee will discuss The Firearms Liberty Act. House Bill 674 would among other changes allow for the issuance of lifetime concealed handgun permits.
School districts promote secure storage
NC S.A.F.E. (Secure All Firearms Effectively), a statewide initiative to raise awareness on storing firearms safely, announced a partnership with the Wake County Public School System last Thursday. NC S.A.F.E for Schools is designed to help school districts across the state share resources about safe gun storage with parents in the district.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

The Wake County Board of Education unanimously passed a resolution in March of last year to “regularly and consistently” provide families with information and resources on the importance of secure gun storage.
North Carolina experienced at least 12 incidents of gunfire on school grounds in 2024, resulting in one death and nine injuries. Residents of Raleigh’s Hedingham neighborhood are still reeling from an October 2022 mass shooting in which a teenager who was able to access his father’s firearms killed five people and wounded two others. The teen charged in that shooting spree will go to trial in 2026.
Research has shown that secure firearm storage practices are associated with up to a 32% reduction in the risk of self-inflicted and unintentional firearm deaths.
“As a school system, we have resolved to educate our community on the importance of safe gun storage and its role in protecting students. Whether providing handouts for safety presentations, helpful information for digital communications, or even materials for school resource officers, resources from NC S.A.F.E. have been invaluable to that mission,” Robert Taylor, superintendent of the Wake County Public School System, said in a statement.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)I watched the April 8 Senate Finance Committee hearing on Rhode Island’s critically essential but chronically underfunded public transit system, which faces a $32.6 million budget deficit. Committee members hammered the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s (RIPTA) new CEO for the agency’s decision to delay a mandated efficiency study due back in March. As lawmakers hinted that the delay in conducting the study justified not providing additional funding for RIPTA, a thought circled my mind: Where is the efficiency study for the new Washington Bridge?
Public transit in Rhode Island has always been held to an unfair standard compared to other public services, especially highways. Nobody proposed doing a cost/benefit analysis before funding the new Washington Bridge despite it costing $713 million. Legislators may argue that the potential for financial savings is a good reason for withholding funding from RIPTA until the efficiency study finishes, but I can make a pretty good guess as to what the results will be. RIPTA has been studied for efficiency seven other times. 
The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council did so in 2002. The Acadia Consulting Group did so in 2006. Consultants Abrams-Cherwony & Associates did so in 2007. The Special Legislative Commission to Study Transit Service in the State of Rhode Island did so in 2007. Then-Gov. Don Carcieri did so in 2008. The Senate Commission on Sustainable Transportation Funding did so in 2011. And finally, RIPTA gave a presentation to the Senate Oversight Committee in March 2023, which references findings by the American Bus Benchmarking Group of RIPTA “outperforming similar agencies across the country in almost every key performance indicator. Despite a chronic lack of funding, RIPTA provides more trips, across a larger area, at a more effective cost per trip than other transit agencies that serve similar population areas anywhere in America.” 
These reports didn’t find inefficiencies within RIPTA that would magically fix its fiscal cliff – rather, many highlighted the need to expand transit and praised RIPTA’s ability to run efficient, award-winning service despite chronic underfunding. Nearly all of these reports proposed many solutions to address the critical need for sustainable, long-term funding for RIPTA; yet two decades later, few of these solutions have ever materialized as RIPTA hobbles from one fiscal year to the next. 
At this point, it’s challenging to see how this eighth efficiency study is anything other than an attempt to avoid funding public transit and deprive Rhode Islanders of the economic growth, traffic reduction, and mobility justice that we deserve.
There is a reason we don’t ask public libraries, state parks, or highway builders to do efficiency studies before giving them money: Financial efficiency is at odds with serving the public effectively. RIPTA’s highest cost services are its rural routes, like the 10x that provides the only transit service to Foster and North Scituate. However, these “inefficient” rural routes are lifelines for the riders who use them and are often the only difference between financial stability and unemployment. RIPTA is a public service, not a business, and it can’t effectively serve the needs of all Rhode Islanders if it is forced to be efficient. There is a reason it’s not called the “Providence County Public Transit Authority.”










At this point, it’s challenging to see how this eighth efficiency study is anything other than an attempt to avoid funding public transit and deprive Rhode Islanders of the economic growth, traffic reduction, and mobility justice that we deserve.


There is no more couch change to find. RIPTA was forced to do more with less when federal funding cuts  plowed a $6M budget gap in 2014. Since 2010, RIPTA has slimmed and slimmed as its largest funding source has withered up, while RIDOT’s budget grew one and a half times as fast. Any belt-tightening left was erased in the financially destructive COVID pandemic, as RIPTA remained one of the only transit agencies in the nation that didn’t cut service.
We don’t need one more study to know that RIPTA is one of the most efficient transit systems in the nation, that 30,000 Rhode Islanders depend on it daily, and that hundreds to thousands would lose their jobs if service is cut. We don’t need one more study to know that the state’s highway system can’t handle even more cars on the road, and it will be impossible to meet our state’s Act on Climate mandates if RIPTA collapses. What we do need is for our state leaders to fund transit as the essential public service it is, to recognize how detrimental letting RIPTA collapse will be for household income, student outcomes, congestion, and the local economy. We don’t need an eighth efficiency study to understand that for tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders, the collapse of RIPTA is like the collapse of a second Washington Bridge.

The Delaware Prescription Opioid Settlement Distribution Commission (POSDC) has opened applications for its third round of grant funding, announcing approximately $13 million in available funds to support initiatives tackling the state’s ongoing opioid crisis.
The funding is aimed at empowering local organizations to launch or expand programs focused on addiction recovery, prevention, and support for those impacted by opioid use disorder.
The grants are part of Delaware’s broader effort to use opioid settlement dollars to address the public health emergency caused by the nationwide epidemic.
“This grant funding offers a critical opportunity to provide real help to individuals, families, and communities struggling with the devastating effects of opioid addiction,” said Joanna Champney, co-chair of the POSDC. “We are committed to supporting programs that promote healing through evidence-based solutions and measurable outcomes.”
Attorney General Kathy Jennings, who also serves as co-chair of the commission, emphasized the importance of using funds recovered from pharmaceutical companies to drive meaningful change.

“This work is close to my heart,” Jennings, co-chair of the POSDC, said. “We at the Department of Justice have been fighting tooth and nail, often punching above our weight, to hold Big Pharma accountable for the devastation they have caused in Delaware. And we have had some big wins, bringing back millions of precious dollars to fund treatment and abatement of the opioid crisis in our state.”
Grants from opioid settlement
Three types of grants are available:

Micro-Grants (up to $10,000): For rapid-response projects, particularly from smaller or community-based organizations.
Mini-Grants ($10,000–$30,000): For more structured projects targeting specific outcomes.
General Grants ($30,000 and up): For larger, long-term programs with established infrastructure and a proven track record.

“We are seeing some real progress with a staggering reduction in the epidemic’s death toll over the last year thanks to the many fantastic people and organizations, the commission included, dedicated to this vital work,” Jennings said. “Yet, there is still so much to be done. Now is the time to dig in and double down, and I trust that this round of grant funding will give us that edge to keep pushing forward.”
Applications opened on April 21. A series of informational webinars for prospective applicants will be held on April 28, May 5, and May 12. The application deadline is May 19.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.
Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Cigarette smoking has declined dramatically among adults and youth, state data shows. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Smoking has steadily declined in Alaska over the past decades, evidence that coordinated health campaigns mounted over several years have been effective, a new report from the state Department of Health said.
Adult cigarette smoking rates fell to 16% in 2023 from 28% in the 1990s, according to the Alaska Tobacco Prevention and Control Program’s annual report, released Wednesday. Among Alaska Native adults, who have long had higher rates of smoking use than the state average, the declines were notable: down to 29% in 2022 from 41% in 2013.
However, about one in four Alaska adults used tobacco or nicotine products in 2023, the report said. That rate has remained constant over several years.
Among Alaska youths, both cigarette smoking and the use of electronic cigarettes have declined, indicating that public health campaigns have been effective, the report said.
Youth smoking rates declined from 37% in the mid-1990s to 7% in 2023, the report said. A sharp decline coincided with the state’s decision in the 1990s to dramatically increase the tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products. The increase, in 1997 legislation, gave Alaska what was at the time the nation’s highest tobacco tax, and it was geared toward discouraging youth from taking up the habit.
Youth use of electronic cigarettes, products that are newer on the market, has also declined, from 26% in 2019 to 17% in 2023, the year with the most recent data from the Alaska Youth Risk Behavior Survey.
Christy Knight, manager of the Alaska Tobacco Prevention and Control Program, said the decline in use of e-cigarettes has come amid a coordinated education campaign within schools and elsewhere.
Still, the 17% rate “is still quite high,” Knight said. “We still have a lot of work to do, but we know that what we’re doing has brought it down and we can continue to bring that down with these comprehensive partnerships and approaches.”
The declines in Alaska tobacco use come amid big declines nationally, and Alaska’s tobacco-use rates remain higher than national averages.
Among adults nationally, cigarette smoking declined from 42.4% in 1965 to 11.6% in 2022, a 60-year low, according to the CDC. About 1 in 5 U.S. adults used tobacco products of any kind in 2022, according to the CDC.
Among youths nationally, use of tobacco products nationwide hit a 25-year low last year, according to the CDC. Only 1.4% of U.S. high school and middle school students reported last year that they regularly smoke cigarettes, and 5.9% reported regular use of e-cigarettes, according to the CDC.
Within Alaska, tobacco and nicotine users have demonstrated strong interest in quitting those habits, the state report said. Last year, 1,816 people made use of services provided through the Alaska Tobacco Quit Line, a free state program, the report said.

	But education and cessation efforts face some additional challenges in rural areas of the state, Knight said.
One is the relative lack of access to health care resources, she said. Primary health providers are key to inspiring people to quit tobacco, but rural residents may be missing that inspiration, she said.
“If somebody’s in a community where they don’t have access to that provider, that can impact whether or not they’re being advised to quit at the same rate as people who are in communities that do have easy access to a health care provider,” she said.
Disparities can result from other factors, such as poverty and discrimination that make it harder for people to know about or get services, or tobacco marketing campaigns that target certain population segments, she said.
In recent years, health organizations and tribal governments in rural areas have stepped up their tobacco prevention and cessation programs, the state report said.
Knight cited the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corp. tobacco control program as one example. That tribal health organization provided information that helped convince the Bethel City Council to expand its city tobacco tax to include nicotine-containing products like e-cigarettes, and it regularly refers patients for tobacco-cessation services, the report noted.
Taxes continue to be used as a tool around the nation to discourage smoking or vaping, but Alaska has no state tax on e-cigarette products.
For the third time, state lawmakers are working on legislation to impose taxes on those products.
One bill to do that was passed by the Legislature in 2022 but was vetoed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The sponsor, Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, introduced another version in 2023, but that bill failed to move forward after the House last year altered it and removed the e-cigarette tax provisions.
Now Stevens has introduced a new version, Senate Bill 24, that had reached the Senate Finance Committee as of late April. A House version, House Bill 49, is pending in that body’s Finance Committee.
Dunleavy has not decided yet whether to sign or veto a bill with an e-cigarette tax, said spokesperson Jeff Turner. “If and when it passes, and is transmitted to the governor’s office, he will review the bill and make a determination,” Turner said by email.
Alaska last raised its state tobacco tax in 2006. Several municipalities have their own taxes on tobacco and e-cigarette products.
While smoking and youth vaping have declined, Alaskans’ use of smokeless tobacco products has remained steady over several years, according to department statistics. From 2011 to 2023, that rate remained around 6%, according to the Alaska Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
Among Alaska smokeless tobacco users, nearly 16% used iqmik, a potent mixture of tobacco and fungus and plant ash that is traditionally used in parts of Western Alaska, according to state statistics. The use of iqmik was showed distinct patterns, according to the department’s data. Among Alaska Native adults who used smokeless tobacco products between 2021 and 2023, about a third used iqmik, Knight said. And among Southwest Alaska residents who used smokeless tobacco between 2021 and 2023, about two-thirds used iqmik, she said.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied. 


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

Two announcements last week were good news for South Carolina’s electric customers and instructive news for our legislators trying to pass an energy bill in the last few days of the session.
The focus of these announcements was on data centers and who pays for the new power plants and transmission lines they will need.
These data centers are large, windowless buildings packed with computers and related components to store massive amounts of data and do high-speed data analysis necessary for AI, artificial intelligence.
They consume huge amounts of electricity that earn them the name “energy hogs.”
Big tech needs these data centers to sell AI services to drive their profits.  Unlike other large industries they create few jobs.
According to our utility executives, data centers account for about 65% of the new energy generation needs of the state.
Private utilities, like Duke Energy and Dominion Energy, are more than willing to build new power plants to serve data centers since building things is the way these utilities really make their money, i.e. profits approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission.
Typically, all utility customers pay for new power plants.
However, the growth of data centers across the country and the new power plants they will require have alarmed state officials nationally.
Other states are looking to protect residential and small business customers from paying higher electric bills driven by the energy needs of big tech data centers.
Last year, a Senate Special Committee on South Carolina’s Energy Future took testimony covering a wide range of issues including data centers.
The consensus of that committee was that consumers needed to be protected from the costs of building new power plants and other facilities mostly to serve new data centers.
As a result, the Senate amended an energy bill (H.3309) previously passed by the House to require data centers to pay their own way for their energy.  There would be no cost shifting to other consumers.
New data centers would pay for the new power plants and transmission they need with higher rates, a minimum billing requirement and a 15-year contract with the utility to guarantee that the data center would pay for the energy generation they said they needed even if they moved or reduced their energy use.
Other consumers would be protected.
The Senate also removed tax incentives for new data centers.  No longer would these data centers be exempt from paying sales tax on their computers and the electricity those computers use.
The Senate concluded that state taxpayer dollars should not be used as an incentive for data centers that produce few local jobs and little other economic benefit to the entire state.
That energy bill is now back in the hands of the House where some members are concerned that data centers would no longer be interested in investing in South Carolina and local governments could lose property tax opportunities.
So, now for last week’s surprising news.
A $2.8 billion computing center was announced in Spartanburg County, reportedly the second largest investment ever in South Carolina.
What makes this supercomputing operation important is that it will generate its own electricity from natural gas. This shows that requiring data centers to cover all costs associated with their energy needs is not a deal breaker.
They will still be very profitable.
The second announcement was that the Board of Santee Cooper, the state-owned utility, voted unanimously not to wait on the state Legislature.
The board voted to immediately adopt special rates, as proposed by the Senate, that would result in data centers not shifting any of their energy costs to other consumers. The board also included new large manufacturers in this policy.
With last week’s energy-related announcements as instructive, the House should accept the Senate’s and Santee Cooper’s lead on protecting other ratepayers from rate hikes due to the costs of providing electricity and transmission to new data centers.
Regarding state tax exemptions to lure data centers, the Senate position should be kept.
Taxpayer money should not be used to attract a data center that generates few employees in a local community but provides very little economic benefit to the rest of the state. Local governments can offer any sweetheart property tax deal they want, as was done for the Spartanburg County data center.
Data centers are coming to South Carolina and every state.  Do we need them here?
No.
But they are welcome as long as the rest of us don’t have to subsidize their profits with higher electric rates and state-tax incentives.

(Photo courtesy of Robin Tallon Jr.)More than three decades after leaving elected office, a former South Carolina congressman transferred $1.25 million from his campaign reserves into a Morgan Stanley account for charitable giving.
Robin Tallon Jr., who represented the 6th Congressional District for 10 years before not seeking re-election in 1992, moved the money last October as a “donation of securities,” according to the description on his last federal campaign filing. That’s not for personal investments, he told the SC Daily Gazette, but to a donor-advised fund to be distributed to charities.
The transfer was intended as the first step in officially shutting down the account, as the 78-year-old Florence resident thought he’d closed the door on attempting a return to politics. But as of Friday, he was rethinking that decision.
Despite not being in office since Bill Clinton’s 1993 inauguration, Tallon said he’s kept his campaign account open — and filed regularly with the Federal Election Commission — ever since, just in case he decided to make another run. In the meantime, he invested donations from decades ago, which is how he had that much money to transfer, he said.

  Former U.S. Rep. Robin Tallon speaks at a press conference on Wednesday, April 29, 1992. (Screenshot courtesy of C-Span.)

“I’ve been encouraged to run by constituents and other people to run over the years,” he told the SC Daily Gazette last week.
And he may yet try to return to Washington — this time as a senator.
He’s considering a 2026 bid to challenge U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham as an independent.
Tallon, a native of Dillon, represented the 6th District as a Democrat when it spanned the Grand Strand and entire Pee Dee region. After a federal court drastically redrew the district’s lines following the 1990 census to create a House seat with a majority Black population, Tallon decided not to seek re-election. Democrat Jim Clyburn has held the seat since.
While he left Congress, Tallon didn’t altogether leave Washington. He worked as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill for a quarter century. His clients included Atria, one of the largest producers of tobacco, and dentists.
Tallon no longer considers himself a Democrat. The party’s moved too far left, he told the Gazette.
But unlike many other former Democrats in South Carolina who switched parties, Tallon doesn’t consider himself a Republican either. He thinks South Carolina has become a “lap dog” for President Donald Trump, who he considers bad for the country. 
So, he’s considering running as an independent, knowing he can’t win that way. But he could “perhaps hold some of our elected officials’ feet to the fire,” he said Friday. 
“It’s almost why not,” he said of a potential bid using the remaining $96,500 left in his campaign account. He would not undo the transfer to Morgan Stanley, he said.
The transfer was part of his 2024 end-of-year report filed April 12, more than two months late. Tallon blamed that on his accountant, saying he didn’t even realize it was past due.
Outside of Tallon, there’s only one former South Carolina congressman with an open campaign account: Gov. Mark Sanford.
As of his last FEC filing, the former two-term governor and two-time 1st District representative had more than $1.3 million cash on hand in his congressional campaign account. He told the Gazette he’s keeping it open because he may seek office again.
Sanford last campaigned in 2019, in a short-lived challenge to Trump. He was ousted from his congressional seat in the 2018 GOP primary, which led to Democrat Joe Cunningham briefly turning the coastal district blue.
If Sanford does return to politics, it wouldn’t be his first comeback. He was widely expected to be done with politics when he left the Governor’s Mansion in January 2011 following a scandalous affair with a woman in Argentina. But two years later, voters sent him back to Congress in a special election to replace Tim Scott, after then-Gov. Nikki Haley appointed him to the U.S. Senate.

Sanford, who has long railed about out-of-control federal spending, had no details of his potential future bid.
“Time will tell,” he told the Gazette about his plans.
FEC requirements
Tallon initially told the Gazette his account would likely be emptied within six weeks. But, with a potential future bid, it will stay open indefinitely.
While certainly unusual, there’s nothing illegal about keeping an account open as long as Tallon, according to the FEC.
The federal agency recommends emptying and closing campaign accounts within six months of leaving office, according to a 2013 advisory opinion. However, there’s no required timeline, a spokesperson for the commission said in an email to the Gazette.
And if a former officeholder is considering a run, as Tallon claims he has been for the last three decades, there’s no requirement to zero out the account at all.
It’s illegal for officeholders to use campaign donations for personal expenses, even after they leave office.
Departing officeholders’ options include reimbursing their donors, donating to charities or giving money to other campaigns and PACs, as South Carolina’s other former congressmen have done.
Former 3rd District Rep. Jeff Duncan, who decided not to seek an eighth term last year, terminated his account in April. He gave the Jobs, Energy and Our Founding Fathers PAC that he sponsored more than $640,000 in the process.
Former 4th District Rep. Trey Gowdy left Congress in 2017 but didn’t close out his account until 2021. He listed a $905,000 donation to the Miriam Foundation, a faith-based organization that provides mentorship and support for young women, in his final FEC filing.
And former Rep. Henry Brown, who represented the coastal 1st District after Sanford left Congress the first time, drained his account slowly, officially closing it nine years after not seeking re-election in 2010. In that time, he made a number of donations to candidates ranging from mayoral races to President Donald Trump.
The donor-advised Morgan Stanley account that Tallon transferred his campaign money to allows him to decide which charities will get the money and when. Determining which organizations to donate has been difficult, he said.
Tallon, who previously served on the Medical University of South Carolina board, said some of the money will go to the hospital, although he doesn’t yet know how much.
Contemplating campaigns
It isn’t unusual for former officeholders to keep accounts open for years after leaving office, said Jordan Libowitz, an expert on campaign finance for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.
Decades, however, is another matter. He’s never seen someone keep an account open as long as Tallon, he said.
“That money probably should have been disposed of years ago,” he said.
A 2018 investigation by the Tampa Bay Times and Tampa-based 10News WTSP, as well as numerous other TV stations, found 100 examples of so-called zombie campaigns. But Tallon stood out as showing “just how much former lawmakers can get away with,” the reporters wrote seven years ago.
Spending from his campaign account included a $20,000 payment to his son as campaign treasurer, $4,000 for a computer in 2007, and a $900 iPad in 2017, according to the report.
At the time, he defended keeping the account open while weighing a potential return to office but conceded it was unlikely.
“I need to give that money away at this point,” he said in January 2018.
But then he changed his mind. In July 2019, Tallon’s lawyer, Butch Bowers, told the FEC that he would not close the account.
“At this time, he has not decided to do so, but he may very well elect to run for office in the near future,” Bowers wrote.
Between the 2018 report and the Morgan Stanley transfer last fall, most of Tallon’s campaign spending went to charities, accounting fees and nearly $8,700 in legal expenses, which he said was used for finding out what his options were for closing the account.
Tallon said he’d contemplated running in multiple elections over the years, both in the House and Senate. He seriously considered challenging U.S. Rep. Tom Rice for the 7th District in 2022 but then decided against it. (Rice was ousted that year by former state Rep. Russell Fry.)
Earlier last week, he told the Gazette he’d decided he was officially done with politics. He planned to close out the account. But on Friday, he was contemplating a run to call out the problems with both major parties.
“This would be a very low budget campaign, but a chance to hold our leaders in Washington accountable,” he said.

Donavan McKinney says his residents have been severely impacted by power outages and poor energy reliability at an Aug. 10, 2023 event centered on climate and energy policy. | Kyle DavidsonState Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit) announced Monday that he would mount a challenge to U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) in the Democratic primary for Michigan’s 13th Congressional District.
McKinney, who noted that the 11th state House District he currently represents is one of the poorest in Michigan while the 13th Congressional District is among the poorest in the nation, said that he would bring working class representation to residents.
“I was born next to smokestacks. We moved 13 times as a kid. Sometimes it was an apartment, sometimes it was a family member’s house. Sometimes it was even our own car. But wherever it was, my mom and grandma made sure it felt like home. I spent my life trying to get back to help the place and people I love. I’ve never forgotten my roots, or the true purpose of why I serve; to always put the people first,” McKinney said in his campaign launch video, adding that Thanedar has “more in common with Donald Trump and Elon Musk than people like us.”

Thanedar, who spent $10 million of his own funds seeking the governor’s seat in 2018, served one term in the Michigan Legislature from 2021 through the end of 2022. He was elected to Congress for the first time that year, winning reelection in 2024.
“I bring the lived realities of the people of this district, lived realities that multimillionaires have no understanding of,” McKinney told the Michigan Advance ahead of his campaign’s launch. “I know our community’s struggles because I’ve lived them — and that’s why I understand just how urgent delivering monumental solutions to their monumental problems are.”
He said he would focus on economic security, environmental justice, education, public transportation, workers’ rights and more.
McKinney isn’t the first state lawmaker to launch a primary challenge against Thanedar. He joins a race that also features former state Sen. Adam Hollier (D-Detroit).
“I think the fact that there are multiple candidates in this race already just makes it crystal clear how fed up our community is with Shri, and how excited they are for representation that truly fights for us in Washington as hard as I have been fighting for us in Lansing,” McKinney said. “I’m running because our community has been calling me over and over to stand up and fight for them in DC, and they want a fresh, new voice leading the biggest, baddest coalition to deliver for this community and that’s exactly what we’re going to do.”
Thanedar has defended his constituent service record while in Congress, previously telling the Advance that since his election, his office has solved over 2,800 constituent cases, recovered nearly $3 million for constituents, received approval for $30 million in community projects, and sponsored and cosponsored 810 different bills. 
“We have world class constituent communication, including a record 11 in-person town halls,” Thanedar said.  SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Since the retirement of former U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Southfield) in 2022, neither of the two congressional districts that encompass Detroit have had a Black representative, an issue considered to be critical by leaders in the predominantly Black city. Both McKinney and Hollier are Black.
Detroit elected its first Black U.S. representative, Charles Diggs Jr., in 1954, and consistently elected a Black representative up until 2022, when voters elected Thanedar, who immigrated from India, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), who is Palestinian American, to Michigan’s 12th Congressional District. 
When asked what resources he plans to bring to a race against Thanedar, who he called “Detroit’s own Elon Musk,” McKinney told the Advance he was supported by an “incredible coalition of elected officials, faith leaders, labor, community members, and more” and he was excited to grow that coalition between now and 2026.
“I’m not running because I’m a millionaire. I’m running because I’m not. I’m running because our community deserves to be able to sleep at night knowing they have a Representative in Congress who truly knows their struggles and truly fights for them every single day,” McKinney said.
McKinney’s campaign claimed the endorsement of a dozen Democratic state legislators on day one, including state Sens. Darrin Camilleri, Stephanie Chang, Veronica Klinefelt and Paul Wojno, and state Reps. Stephanie Young, Erin Byrnes, Kimberly Edwards, Alabas Farhat, Peter Herzberg, Tullio Liberati, Tonya Myers-Phillips and Veronica Paiz.
McKinney plans to hold an official campaign launch event Monday evening at SAY Detroit Play at the Lipke Community Center in Detroit.

In the aftermath of the deadly January Los Angeles County wildfires, Gov. Gavin Newsom traveled to L.A. and Washington, D.C. to lobby President Donald Trump and members of Congress for federal aid. 
But three months later, Congress has yet to move on Newsom’s $40 billion request, reports CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff. Meanwhile, frustrations from Democratic voters over Trump’s other policies put mounting pressure on the governor to push back — even though Newsom must still work with Trump to secure disaster relief.
Newsom met the president during a particularly tense time in their relationship: Trump had repeatedly threatened to withhold federal disaster aid; and the state Legislature wrapped up a special session, called by Newsom, to earmark funds for potential legal clashes against Trump’s administration.
After their meetings, Trump said an “L.A. fire fix” was coming, and Newsom — compared to his self-positioning last fall as an outspoken leader to the Trump resistance — didn’t hold any press events for most of late February. (Instead, he grabbed headlines while speaking with conservative firebrands on his new podcast.)
But in the months that followed, the Trump administration has attempted to enact tariffs that threaten California’s economy; proposed deep cuts to federal agencies and programs; and defied court orders regarding mass deportations — prompting Newsom to either file lawsuits or publicly speak out against the federal policies.
The governor has had a “tone shift,” said Bob Salladay, Newsom’s senior communications adviser, because “there has been a policy shift from D.C. that is beyond alarming.”
And what about that aid money? The Newsom administration is optimistic Congress will approve additional disaster aid by this summer. A bipartisan group, made up of all of California’s congressional delegation, is advocating for the relief package.
As for Newsom, he told reporters last week that he is continuing to work behind the scenes to maintain his relationship with Trump, but would still defend the state’s core principles.

Newsom: “If you want to make a point, you may want to reconsider. If you want to make a difference, stand tall and firm. And that’s kind of the approach.”

Covered California shared personal data

More than 2 million Californians are enrolled in Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act. Last year, some of these enrollees had their personal data shared with LinkedIn.
Recent forensic testing by CalMatters’ Tomas Apodaca and Colin Lecher revealed that Covered California’s website has been sending sensitive data to the for-profit job recruiting social networking site — and that visitors could have had their data tracked for more than a year.
As visitors filled out forms on Covered California’s website, trackers sent information to Linkedin. The information included whether visitors were blind, pregnant or used a high number of prescription medications. The trackers also monitored whether visitors said they were transgender or possible victims of domestic abuse.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Covered California confirmed that data was sent to LinkedIn as part of an advertising campaign that began in February 2024. Since CalMatters and The Markup’s reporting about the issue, however, most ad trackers have been removed from the site.

Today the Senate Transportation Committee is considering a bill that would shorten the length of freight trains in California. Proponents say the bill would make railways safer, but critics argue the measure could raise the price of goods in a state already struggling with a high cost-of-living.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, the bill by Democratic Sen. Bob Archuleta of Norwalk would cap the maximum length of a freight train to 7,500 feet, or about 125 60-foot-long rail cars. The railway industry employs several thousand workers, including ones represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The union argues that shorter trains are less likely to derail. The bill passed its first committee hearing last week after Democrats in the Senate’s committee on energy, utilities and communications voted to advance the measure.
The train industry and at least two dozen other business groups oppose the bill. They argue that shortening trains could make transporting goods more expensive since longer trains require fewer engines and crew members to pull. The proposal also may not be legal: The federal government wields broad authority over interstate commerce, enabling it to have final say on regulating railroads.

It is reviewing its website practices.,"In summary
The state’s health insurance exchange transmitted pregnancy and domestic abuse data during a marketing campaign. It is reviewing its website practices.


The website that lets Californians shop for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, coveredca.com, has been sending sensitive data to LinkedIn, forensic testing by CalMatters has revealed. 
As visitors filled out forms on the website, trackers on the same pages told LinkedIn their answers to questions about whether they were blind, pregnant, or used a high number of prescription medications. The trackers also monitored whether the visitors said they were transgender or possible victims of domestic abuse. (See the data on our Github repo.)
Covered California, the organization that operates the website, removed the trackers as  CalMatters and The Markup reported this article. The organization said they were removed “due to a marketing agency transition” in early April. 
In a statement, Kelly Donohue, a spokesperson for the agency, confirmed that data was sent to LinkedIn as part of an advertising campaign. Since  being informed of the tracking, “all active advertising-related tags across our website have been turned off out of an abundance of caution, she added.” 
“Covered California has initiated a review of our websites and information security and privacy protocols to ensure that no analytics tools are impermissibly sharing sensitive consumer information,” Donohue said, adding that they would “share additional findings as they become available, taking any necessary steps to safeguard the security and privacy of consumer data.”
When an individual indicated they were pregnant, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
Visitors who filled out health information on the site may have had their data tracked for more than a year, according to Donohue, who said the LinkedIn campaign began in February 2024. 
CalMatters observed the trackers directly in February and March of this year. It confirmed most ad trackers, including the Meta “pixel” tracker, as well as all third-party cookies, have been removed from the site as of April 21. 
Since 2014, more than 50 million Americans have signed up for health insurance through state exchanges like Covered California. They were set up under the Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama 15 years ago. States can either operate their exchange websites in partnership with the federal government or independently, as California does. 
Covered California operates as an independent entity within the state government. Its board is appointed by the governor and Legislature. 
In March, Covered California announced that, after four years of increasing enrollment, a record of nearly 2 million people were covered by health insurance through the program. In all, the organization said, about one in six Californians were at one point enrolled through Covered California. Between 2014 and 2023, the uninsured rate fell from 17.2% to 6.4%, according to the organization, the largest drop of any state during that time period. This coincided with a series of eligibility expansions to Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for lower-income households.
Experts expressed alarm at the idea that those millions of people could have had sensitive health data sent to a private company without their knowledge or consent. Sara Geoghegan, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said it was “concerning and invasive” for a health insurance website to be sending data that was “wholly irrelevant” to the uses of a for-profit company like LinkedIn.
“It’s unfortunate,” she said, “because people don’t expect that their health information will be collected and used in this way.”
The LinkedIn Insight Tag
CalMatters and The Markup in recent months scanned for trackers on hundreds of California state and county government websites that offer services for undocumented immigrants using Blacklight, an automated tool developed by The Markup for auditing website trackers. 
“People don’t expect that their health information will be collected and used in this way.”Sara Geoghegan, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center
CalMatters found that Covered California had more than 60 trackers on its site. Out of more than 200 of the government sites, the average number of trackers on the sites was three. Covered California had dozens more than any other website we examined. 
On coveredca.com, trackers from well-known social media firms like Meta collected information on visitor page views, while lesser-known analytics and media campaign companies like email marketing company LiveIntent also followed users across the site. 
But by far the most sensitive information was transmitted to LinkedIn. 
While some of the data sent to LinkedIn was relatively innocuous, such as what pages were visited, Covered California also sent the company detailed information when visitors selected doctors to see if they were covered by a plan, including their specialization. The site also told LinkedIn if someone searched for a specific hospital.
When an individual selected a medical provider, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
In addition to demographic information including gender, the site also shared details with LinkedIn when visitors selected their ethnicity and marital status, and when they told coveredca.com how often they saw doctors for surgery or outpatient treatment. 
When an individual selected their ethnicity, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
LinkedIn, like other large social media firms, offers a way for websites to easily transmit data on their visitors through a tracking tool that the sites can place on their pages. In LinkedIn’s case, this tool is called the Insight Tag. By using the tag, businesses and other organizations can later target advertisements on LinkedIn to consumers that have already shown interest in their products or services. For an e-commerce site, a tracker on a page might be able to note when someone added a product to their cart, and the business can then send ads for that product to the same person on their social media feeds. 
A health care marketplace like Covered California might use the trackers to reach a group of people who might be interested in a reminder of a deadline for open health insurance enrollment, for example.
In its statement, Covered California noted the usefulness of these tools, saying the organization “leverages LinkedIn’s advertising platform tools to understand consumer behavior and deliver tailored messages to help them make informed decisions about their health care options.”
When an individual indicated they were a victim of domestic abuse or spousal abandonment, the information was sent to LinkedIn via the Insight Tag.
Trackers can also be valuable to the social media companies that offer them. In addition to driving ad sales, they provide an opportunity to gather information on visitors to websites other than their own.
On its informational page about the Insight Tag, LinkedIn places the burden on websites that employ the tag not to use it in risky situations. The tag “should not be installed on web pages that collect or contain Sensitive Data,” the page advises, including “pages offering specific health-related or financial services or products to consumers.”
LinkedIn spokesperson Brionna Ruff said in an emailed statement, “Our Ads Agreement and documentation expressly prohibit customers from installing the Insight Tag on web pages that collect or contain sensitive data, including pages offering health-related services.. We don’t allow advertisers to target ads based on sensitive data or categories.”
Legal recourse
Collection of sensitive information by social media trackers has in previous instances led to removal of the trackers, lawsuits, and scrutiny by state and federal lawmakers.
For example, after The Markup in 2022 revealed the Department of Education sent personal information to Facebook when students applied for college financial aid online, the department turned off the sharing, faced questions from two members of Congress, and was sued by two advocacy groups who sought more information about the sharing. Other stories in the same series about trackers, known as the Pixel Hunt, also led to changes and blowback, including a crackdown by the Federal Trade Commission on telehealth companies transmitting personal information to companies including Meta and Google without user consent and proposed class action lawsuits over information shared through trackers with drug stores, health providers, and tax prep companies.
LinkedIn is already facing multiple proposed class-action lawsuits related to the collection of medical information. In October, three new lawsuits in California courts alleged that LinkedIn violated users’ privacy by collecting information on medical appointment sites, including for a fertility clinic. 
Social media companies’ tracking practices have underpinned the tremendous growth of the tech industry, but few web users are aware of how far the tracking goes. “This absolutely contradicts the expectation of the average consumer,” Geoghegan said. 
In California, a law called the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act governs the privacy of medical information in the state. Under the act, consumers must give permission to some organizations before their medical information is disclosed to third parties. Companies have faced litigation under the law for using web tracking technologies, although those suits have not always been successful. 
Geoghegan said current protections like these don’t go far enough in helping consumers protect their sensitive data. 
“This is an exact example of why we need better protections,” she said of LinkedIn receiving the data. “This is sensitive health information that consumers expect to be protected and a lack of regulations is failing us.”

Police agencies — under scrutiny and worried about their own liability — increasingly won’t respond to someone in a mental health crisis unless that person is committing a crime. So who will transport people in psychosis to get help? And who will keep those around them safe? 


Susanna’s Sacramento County home bears the scars of her daughter’s mental illness. There is the lump on the wall near the entryway, patched after the girl, now 17, busted through the drywall. On a recent day, a double door in a bulky box awaited installation — to replace the splintered entry to the bedroom Susanna shares with her husband. 
The rages began when the girl was in fourth grade, said Susanna, whose last name CalMatters is withholding to protect her daughter’s identity. In recent years, the family has resorted to calling 911. Susanna said she has sustained a black eye and other minor injuries while fine-tuning her daughter’s medications, which include an antipsychotic. Mostly, she said, they’ve called in desperation for help when they had nowhere else to turn.  
“They have been able to assist, whether it be taking her to the hospital for a 5150 hold, or just de-escalating the situation,” said Susanna, using the Welfare and Institutions Code shorthand “5150” for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation, due to danger to self or others, or grave disability. 
Starting early last year, though, Susanna noticed that law enforcement “seemed more disinterested in those calls.” Then, as another crisis unfolded Feb. 7, the Sheriff’s Department made it clear they would not be coming out at all. 
The 911 audio and a summary log lay out the scene: Susanna’s husband was trying to sleep when the daughter, who was on probation, barged into the bedroom just before midnight, spit in his face, and “threatened to stab me and kill me.” A dispatcher asked if the daughter had “mental health issues;” the husband said she did.
What the couple didn’t realize: Due to a recent policy change, that detail kicked the call up to a supervisor — and ultimately left Susanna and her family to fend for themselves. 
Susanna said she saw her daughter heading back to the bedroom with a kitchen knife. She locked the door and was leaning against it to keep it from giving way under her daughter’s blows as her husband spoke to the dispatcher. The four-minute conversation ended when the dispatcher promised to “have someone out there.” 
Instead, a supervisor called the husband back. A call log states that they discussed the girl’s “extensive” mental health issues and history of assault as the screaming and pounding continued. The supervisor then suggested the couple stay in the locked bedroom. 
“No crime,” the call log concludes. Sacramento Sheriff’s Office “not responding.” 
Why a sheriff pulls deputies back on mental health calls
In early January, Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper met with county behavioral health and emergency medical response partners and dropped a bomb. His department would no longer respond to mental health crisis calls unless a crime had occurred, was in progress, or someone other than the person in crisis was deemed to be in imminent danger.
While he’d been pondering the pullback for a year, he told them, what pushed him to act was a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that he believes heightens his officers’ liability on non-criminal mental health calls.
“Law enforcement officers are not trained mental health professionals,” Cooper announced in a news conference a month later. “We wear the badge; we carry the gun. We deal with crime – not mental health crises.” When his department responds to calls that do involve crimes, he added, they will be treated as a “major event” — suggesting they might result in arrest rather than transport for care under the 5150 code. Cooper has called the change a “hard reset”  — one he knew would be controversial.

Yet these issues have challenged policymakers for more than half a century: Because mental illness isn’t a crime, when should law enforcement be involved, if at all? Who is best suited to safely de-escalate a mental health crisis and coax a person to accept care? And what if that person won’t — or due to the nature of their psychosis or substance use cannot — agree to go voluntarily? Who will transport them for involuntary psychiatric holds? 
Families of seriously ill loved ones say they’ve clamored for answers to that latter question for some time now. One desperate mother whose son recently needed to be taken to the hospital for urgent evaluation resorted to hiring a bounty hunter.
California under Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken bold steps  to broaden access to  care for people with untreated psychotic illnesses and substance use disorders— including expanding the legal definition of “grave disability” under the 5150 code. That law is expected to compel more people to receive treatment. Its success depends in part on transporting those in crisis for evaluations — even if they won’t go voluntarily. 
Just a week after Sacramento County implemented the new law, Sheriff Cooper informed his partners of his policy shift. Now, as he publicizes his position at a law enforcement conference and webinar and through his own podcast, some other agencies are following his lead. 
 Cooper cites his eight years in the state Assembly as instructive. There, he said in an interview, “We always heard, hey, we don’t want law enforcement responding to mental health calls. I come back as sheriff, and I’ve seen a lot of bad outcomes, in California and across the nation…Sometimes, introducing a badge and gun can really make it go sideways.”
Cooper was sworn in two months after a fatal deputy-involved shooting of a man in psychosis whose wife called for help as he threatened to hurt himself with a machete. He died 23 seconds after the lone deputy arrived. Last March, another such shooting took the life of a mentally ill man whose sister called 911 as he cut himself in the bathtub with a knife. Litigation is pending in both cases.

Susanna had seen Cooper’s announcement on TV. Three nights later, as she braced herself against the bedroom door, it didn’t cross her mind. Instead, she was shaken by the lack of response by law enforcement to what felt like a volatile and potentially dangerous situation.
“At that moment, you’re just thinking, ‘We need to get help here now, before this escalates further,’” she said. “Who is going to assist my family in these situations, and not only my family, but other families like mine, whose child might be more aggressive or might actually kill them or hurt them very badly? Who is going to step in and stop that before it’s too late?”
When medical workers want police to handle it
Like many jurisdictions, Sacramento County has been pushing to reduce the role of law enforcement in behavioral health crises and avoid traumatic hospitalizations — or arrests — when possible, instead helping people develop safety plans and plugging them into outpatient care. 
Still, county Behavioral Health Services Director Ryan Quist said law enforcement will always be critical to the “system level response.” His civilian crisis teams, made up of a clinician and a peer, cannot engage without backup in situations where people in crisis have weapons or are  particularly volatile — even if they are only threatening to harm themselves. And, he said, when clinicians determine an evaluation for a psychiatric hold under the 5150 code is necessary, they cannot detain or transport those too agitated or ill to consent to go. 
“Behavioral health doesn’t have that training skill set, or desire, to actually put hands on somebody and make them go somewhere,” said Quist. Beyond that, because they are not peace officers, “legally speaking, that’s assault.”
County leaders are scrambling to assess the damage. In emotional public testimony in February before the county’s Sheriff Community Review Commission — an advisory body that has no control over the elected official’s policies — Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District officials said Cooper’s department had denied 14 of their 21 requests from the field for backup over the previous 11 days.
“Put yourself in the shoes of the folks living next door. They were sound asleep at three in the morning….Their kids, their families could potentially have been in harm’s way.” Sacramento Fire Battalion Chief Parker Wilbourn
Each “presents a safety factor for the community that’s going to at some point either get somebody really hurt or killed,” Battalion Chief Parker Wilbourn told the commission, noting that close collaboration on such calls is the gold standard. “That’s why we heavily rely on our law enforcement brothers and sisters to have our backs like we have theirs.”
Dispatch records and incident reports shared in response to a CalMatters public records request show that, of those 14 cases, Metro Fire responders were able to get three people experiencing psychosis to agree to be taken to the hospital. In seven other cases, they were either unable to evaluate people in crisis due to safety concerns or unable to transport those who were uncooperative. 
Two calls involved a man wearing an ankle monitor and threatening his landlord’s son over an attempted eviction. Firefighters first came to the scene to evaluate the landlord for high blood pressure — and called for backup because the tenant’s threats, “confused speech, unsteady gait and erratic behavior” concerned them. “Situation becoming unstable,” the log notes. Yet a sheriff’s sergeant who waited nearby made it clear: “Won’t resp unless a crime occurs.”  
With no help on the way, the log continues, the landlord and two other residents “fled [the] scene” in fear.  Five hours later, the tenant  called 911 to say that he was bleeding from an injury, and planned to shoot himself and set the house on fire. Rancho Cordova Police, staffed by the Sheriff’s Department under a longstanding contract, declined to respond. Fire responders waited outside, checking for signs of smoke, but did not feel safe to  enter. 
“I want you to put yourself in the shoes of the folks living next door,” Wilbourn told the commission. “They were sound asleep at three in the morning when this was taking place. Their kids, their families could potentially have been in harm’s way.”
“Probably juvenile hall isn’t where she needs to be. She would be better off at a hospital, but (deputies) don’t take them anymore.”Susanna, whose daughter is facing charges of making terrorist threats
In Susanna’s case, neither her husband nor the Sheriff’s Department requested emergency medical personnel. Her daughter did calm down, eventually. Not long after the incident, she got off probation — something that would not have happened if she had been criminally charged for the spitting or threats that night. 
Sheriff Cooper has stressed that “being mentally ill should not be a crime. Someone shouldn’t have to be arrested and go to jail to get help.” But with no transport options for those who won’t or can’t consent to psychiatric evaluations that outcome can become inevitable.
Despite a follow-up with her psychiatrist, Susanna said, her daughter’s  mental health worsened, bringing deputies to the house three times earlier this month. All involved escalating disputes with a younger brother, the Sheriff’s Department confirmed. Once, a mail carrier dialed 911 as he heard yelling and furniture breaking. 
At the last call, on April 16, they took her into custody. Susanna had locked up the kitchen knives. But after assaulting her younger brother, she said, her daughter grabbed a fireplace poker and chased him with it, threatening to kill him. Her daughter is now in juvenile hall facing charges of making terrorist threats. 
“Probably juvenile hall isn’t where she needs to be,” said Susanna, who is pressing social workers to place her daughter in a treatment facility. “She would be better off at a hospital, but (deputies) don’t take them anymore. They no longer provide that service.”

An alternative to law enforcement is ideal, said Dominic Sisti, a bioethicist who directs the Scattergood Program for the Applied Ethics of Behavioral Health Care at the University of Pennsylvania. “But when you have somebody who is potentially violent towards themselves or others, I don’t see any way around having somebody there who has the training to manage that situation from a safety perspective, not just a health care perspective.” 
In the long term, he said, “these individuals are going to get sicker. They’re going to probably get more agitated. The families are going to suffer and we’re going to see worse outcomes.”
Among the most effective responses in volatile situations, experts say, are co-response teams, made up of a clinician who rides shotgun with law enforcement. In an interview, Sheriff Cooper described the two teams his department had been operating as “incredibly successful” — though they would not have been available at midnight, when Susanna’s family arguably needed them most. Now, given Cooper’s policy change, the behavioral health director has assigned those clinicians to other law enforcement agencies in Sacramento County. 
Cooper’s stance is nevertheless resonating with agencies who say they’ve been overly burdened with responsibility for the crisis of serious mental illness ever since California’s Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, which created the 5150 civil code, went into effect in 1969. All states now have similar laws.
“We’re not in the profession of white coats coming out to take somebody to the hospital,” said Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes, president of the California State Sheriffs Association. 
Barnes said he has long been committed to getting his department “out of social work.” Last year, his dispatchers began vetting non-criminal mental health calls, diverting 80 to other resources. Now, given his own heightened liability concerns, he’s taking it further. The 5150 code, he said, states that law enforcement “may” — not “shall” — initiate involuntary psychiatric holds, detain, and transport for evaluation those who appear to meet criteria. 
“We are going to be considering what is the best alternative approach,” Barnes said, “and some of that might be saying, ‘I’m sorry Mr. and Mrs. Jones, but you’re going have to deal with your son a new way.” 
The court ruling that set police on edge
The 9th Circuit ruling cited by Cooper, Scott v. Smith, resulted in the loss of “qualified immunity” for two Las Vegas police officers whose actions led to the death of an unarmed mentally ill man. The decision, which exposes the officers to personal liability, has without question troubled law enforcement. 
Roy Anthony Scott called Las Vegas police for help on the early morning of March 3, 2019, believing there were people inside his home plotting to harm him. The two responding officers persuaded him to come outside, where he obeyed commands and handed over two weapons. Bodycam footage reveals that Scott told the officers  he had schizophrenia, that he was too paranoid to turn around and face the wall. Twice, he asked, “Can you just put me in the car please?” 
When the officers grabbed Scott’s arms to restrain him on a mental health hold, court records show, he flailed and begged them to stop. Instead, they took him to the ground and placed him on his stomach. One applied bodyweight to Scott’s neck and chest “for about one to two minutes,” while the other held his legs. 
In keeping with U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the three-judge panel balanced the type and level of force used on Scott against the nature of his crime and threat he posed. Since Scott was mentally ill, not suspected of a crime, unarmed and posed no risk to officers or anyone else, “the government’s interest in applying force was limited,” they wrote, adding that any reasonable officer would have known that bodyweight compression to the neck and chest “created a serious risk of asphyxiating Scott.” 
Furthermore, they noted, the officers failed to attempt “less intrusive alternatives” such as “verbal de-escalation,” waiting for backup to execute a “safer ‘team takedown,’” or for emergency medical personnel “to execute a ‘soft restraint.’”
“Who would want to have a job where you’re doing what’s right, something happens, and you lose your house and everything you’ve ever earned?”Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper
Las Vegas police have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. 
Sheriff Cooper’s take is blunt: Any level of force on a non-criminal mental health call could lead an officer to ruin. “Someone doesn’t want to go, you’ve got to wrestle them on the ground, something happens, maybe they have a cardiac arrest. You lose qualified immunity,” he said. “Who would want to have a job where you’re doing what’s right, something happens, and you lose your house and everything you’ve ever earned?”
The law firm that provides legal advice to the California Police Chiefs Association and the California State Sheriffs Association disagrees. 
The court came to its conclusion by weighing all “facts and circumstances before it,” as they would in any Fourth Amendment excessive-force case, attorney James R. Touchstone of the firm Jones Mayer concluded in a Feb. 12 “client alert memorandum” addressed to “all Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police.” 
“Although many may disagree with the Court’s determination, including this author,” Touchstone wrote in the seven-page memo obtained by CalMatters, “it does not stand for the proposition that qualified immunity is unavailable to law enforcement officers” who are responding to non–criminal mental health calls and may need to be detained and transported to the hospital on an involuntary psychiatric hold.  
A commentary posted to Police1, a national online law enforcement resource, was more pointed. Given law enforcement’s longstanding role in psychiatric detention and transport, ample training opportunities, and best practices based on partnerships with clinicians and emergency medical responders, Cooper’s policy change, it states, “while well-intentioned, is simply wrong.” 
Desperate enough to hire a bounty hunter 
Patricia Wentzel, who serves on Sacramento County’s mental health board, has blasted Cooper’s stance as discriminatory, given that law enforcement responds to other non-criminal crises involving people with dementia or developmental disabilities. “I don’t think he feels a responsibility to this group of people,” she said. “That’s the impression conveyed by this decision.” 
Yet across the state, parents with severely mentally ill loved ones living at home aren’t exactly surprised. Katy Polony, a family advocate on an Alameda County mobile crisis team, said criminalization has often been the only option. 
“’Get a restraining order. Then we will forcibly go in. We’ll get that person out of there, and we’ll put them on the street,’” Polony said. “That’s what families have been told to do, forced to do.” 
Indeed, Susanna and her husband say that was the sheriff supervisor’s final suggestion to them on Feb. 7 before he hung up — that if they feared the daughter they should get a restraining order when she turns 18. 
While restraining orders are civil, violating them is a crime. 
“’Get a restraining order. Then we will forcibly go in’…That’s what families have been told to do, forced to do.” Katy Polony, a family advocate on an Alameda County mobile crisis team
Last year, Polony helped organize a group of parents from Fremont to press police to engage more on behavioral health crisis calls. After Cooper went public with his policy, she began hosting bimonthly Zoom calls to gather family input statewide. That’s where Mary Palafox first shared her story. 
For the past 14 years, Palafox has served as private conservator to her son, deemed gravely disabled by schizophrenia that took hold in his early 20s. Many parents don’t want the responsibility, or can’t afford to take it on. But Palafox has means. Her son, an artist who loves animals, thrives at the family’s Orange County home when he is stable. 
As her son’s conservator, Palafox has a standing court order to have her son evaluated at a hospital when she sees fit. When he has been too ill to consent to go voluntarily, law enforcement has helped coerce him onto an ambulance gurney. Until recently. 
Five years had passed since her son’s last hospitalization, but after stopping his medication, he retreated deep into his illness, she said. In early January, Palafox said, his doctor urged her to get him to the emergency room. Each serious bout of psychosis causes damage to the brain that can lead to neurocognitive deficits. As a nurse and longtime mental health advocate and educator, Palafox knew “it was a medical emergency.”

But, despite her legal paperwork, two law enforcement agencies declined to touch her son. Palafox first called 911 as he sat in florid psychosis in a Tustin restaurant. When he emerged, Tustin police officers “watched him walk away. They said that they cannot engage with him unless he’s committing a crime,” she said, “that they no longer help transport or ‘lay hands’ on anybody who has a mental illness.”
Palafox tried again a few days later as her son hid in a backyard shed at home, in psychosis. The Orange County Sheriff’s Department serves her unincorporated neighborhood, and deputies arrived along with a fire truck and ambulance, just as they had five years earlier. This time, she said, they told her they would not go into the backyard to evaluate her son for fear of escalation. They would only take him to the hospital if he climbed onto the gurney himself. 
“It would have had to be completely self-directed, and he was too symptomatic to understand that he needed to go,” Palafox said. “If he was capable of doing that, I would have taken him in my own car!”
Desperate, Palafox reached for her phone. “You just need a big guy to come in and help you,” mused one attorney who handles county conservatorships but had never heard of such law enforcement refusals for conservatees. Her second call, to a friend who runs a nonprofit for crime survivors, turned up a name. The man’s line of work: “Fugitive recovery.” 
The first image that popped into Palafox’s head was “Dog the Bounty Hunter,” the longhaired reality TV phenom. But the man who took her next call was professional and thorough. He reviewed her legal paperwork, and informed the sheriff’s department and UCI Medical Center security of his plans. When he showed up at Palafox’s place with a partner a few hours later, they went straight to the shed, where her son was still huddled. 
“He was kind of hanging on to things, not wanting to leave the shed,” said Palafox, who commended the men for their kindness, “but then they just picked him up.” With the aid of soft restraints, they “took him and put him in their truck.”
Palafox followed, informing the mental health liaison at the emergency room of their progress as she drove. They were directed to the ambulance bay – and, to the amazement of hospital staff who gathered to witness the unprecedented delivery, it was done. Palafox said her son was so ill he remained hospitalized for three months. 
Palafox paid $1,700 for the intervention, a fee she knows many families can’t afford. Neither do most have standing court orders to have their loved ones evaluated. But they share a problem.

“I’m not certain if that gap needs to be filled by our police and by our sheriff’s department,” she said. “I understand their scope of practice is people committing crime. It’s just that the transport need is still there.” 
When asked about Palafox’s experience, Orange County Sheriff Barnes returned to the distinction in the 5150 code — “may” versus “shall.” Just because she has a standing court order, he said “it does not by default mean we have to provide services. We are going to be taking a different review of our obligation to intervene — and in many cases there isn’t any.” 
The Del Norte County Sheriff and Crescent City Police Department have embraced more sweeping policies similar to Cooper’s, telling local media they will no longer respond to non-criminal mental health crisis calls. Barnes said he’s certain others will follow. 
Dial 911: Breaking “the habit that people got into”
There is little disagreement on the need to minimize the role of law enforcement in mental health crises. Alternatives that center dignity, self-directed care and lasting therapeutic relationships, while not widespread, are more available than ever. 
“The police were on the front lines for decades. And then the jails and the prisons were on the front lines. And now, in the last five years or so, we’re trying to move away from that,” said Yolo County Superior Court Judge Samuel McAdam, who teaches a course at UC Davis Law School on “mental health and the courts” that dives deep into the evolution of crisis response. “We’re trying to create a transformation in our society where everyone is taking responsibility, and the police are there for narrow important cases.” 
In many ways, Sacramento County is well-positioned to deliver. It was among the first in California to operate a  988 suicide and crisis lifeline — created by Congress in 2020 to reduce reliance on police. Cooper’s policy shift has now fast-tracked efforts to integrate 911 and 988 technologies, so dispatchers can make a smooth handoff and track that data. 
Last month, 988 counselors fielded 1,826 calls countywide, resolving more than 90% by phone, according to a spokesperson for WellSpace Health, which runs the service. In 16 cases, counselors determined there was an immediate threat to life so called out law enforcement or fire responders. They referred 154 calls to Sacramento County’s in-person “Community Wellness Response Teams.” Made up of a behavioral clinician and a peer with lived experience, they operate 24/7.
Due to critical Medi-Cal funding secured by California two years ago, similar teams are scaling up across the state. 
Meanwhile, two specialized teams run by the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, which pair a nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant with a paramedic, have been ramping up service to people in behavioral health distress. And, though Cooper’s teams have been sidelined, Sacramento County social workers have been riding shotgun with a handful of police departments on those “co-response” teams.

Kaino Hopper is a mental health advocate and mother of a severely ill adult daughter, has helped develop the civilian crisis teams. She said she was appalled by the unilateral nature of Sheriff Cooper’s decision. Like others, she believes close collaboration among law enforcement, behavioral health and fire responders must be restored. Yet for “families like mine,” she told the Sheriff Review Commission in March, there’s a silver lining. 
“We’re not entirely disappointed. Why? Because it’s made people need to know who we are and what we are,” Hopper said of 988 and the all-hours crisis teams. “We’re getting the flyers out there, grassroots, one-on-one,” at Sacramento Kings games, concerts and other public gatherings.
Dialing 911 for every mental health crisis “was the habit people got into,” Hopper told the commission. Now, she said, “our response teams are able to do 90% of the de-escalation necessary. Families are happy, support people are happy, even the person in distress is happy to have a non-uniformed person come out with an open-ended time frame.” 
McAdam, the Yolo County Superior Court judge, said these types of innovations should reduce the number of calls on which police are asked to assist. But they’ll always be involved when serious crimes occur. They should also be counted on to respond when civilian partners believe they can’t safely handle a situation, or need help to safely evaluate and transport on 5150 holds. That’s why training is critical. 
Tag team tactics “when things are chaotic”
A 2015 state law mandates some crisis intervention training for law enforcement, to help them understand and identify mental illness and best communicate with those in crisis. A Sacramento County Sheriff’s spokesperson said the department is in compliance and then some. Others have taken their training much further.
San Francisco Police Lt. Donald Anderson instructs outside agencies across the country on tactics that reduce risk and liability. As the head of his department’s Crisis Intervention Team, he coordinates with emergency medical responders and public health social workers to triage cases of people in distress, among them those who generate multiple 911 calls per week or day. “Then we can work with one another to see what else can we offer to get them to the resources they need,” Anderson said in an interview. “We tag team it.”

More than three-fourths of the department’s patrol officers have received 40 hours of voluntary crisis training, co-taught by clinicians and mental health advocates, with input from peers. But the game changer, a change in field practices that drove use of force on crisis calls down by 68% over a four-year period, was a different type of training — a mandatory one that Anderson helped craft.
Anderson is stocky with an enthusiastic teaching style and a passion for jiu jitsu. A prominent tattoo on his forearm honors the traditional Japanese code of ethics and conduct followed by samurai warriors. On a recent early morning with fog settled on the city’s hilltop police academy, he welcomed a group of officers to his 10-hour class. For years, he told them, those who’d sought out voluntary trainings wound up on crisis calls with partners who hadn’t. That was a problem. Behind it was a bigger one:  “We weren’t talking about the actual tactics of law enforcement.”
“When things are chaotic and you have an individual running around in the middle of downtown, maybe with a knife, shouting and screaming, and you’re trying to control the public and trying to engage with this individual, tactically how does that look?” Anderson asked his students.
“Slow everything down and start evaluating the situation. ‘What’s the crime? Is there a crime'”? San Francisco Police Lt. Donald Anderson
In 2016, Anderson and his then-supervisor traveled to Seattle to learn about that city’s “team approach” — and modeled their new training accordingly. Unless violence is imminent, teams assemble at the scene, each member with a defined role. 
Containing the person in crisis is the critical first goal. It allows for distance, Anderson told the class, and containment plus distance buys time. “Slow everything down and start evaluating the situation,” he said. “What’s the crime? Is there a crime? Because, if there’s no crime, we have to ask, ‘what are we trying to accomplish here?”
The scope of allowable force, he told the class, is “very narrow,” so “you have to be very, very smart about what options you are going to use.” 
Liability is always a concern. But case law offers a road map to navigate risk. Anderson did discuss Scott v. Smith with his class. Yet when it comes to people experiencing a medical or psychiatric crises who have not committed crimes, aren’t resisting arrest and don’t pose direct threats to law enforcement, his department draws guidance from another ruling.

In 2017, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court decision to strip a Michigan sheriff’s deputy of qualified immunity. Instead it established a novel three-factor test to guide response: If the person’s emergency poses an immediate threat of harm to themselves or others, and “some degree of force” is reasonably necessary to get them needed care, there is no loss of qualified immunity – unless the force applied is excessive. 
While the decision is not binding outside the 6th Circuit, legal advisors have encouraged law enforcement nationwide to consider it.
To ensure minimal use of force, officers often must collaborate with emergency medical responders to plan the least traumatic way to get a person onto an ambulance gurney. And sometimes, Anderson said, the best option “is to walk away” and follow up later. 
A policy authored by Anderson also lays out a protocol to disengage from a barricaded and potentially armed person who is threatening only themselves. It requires that other options be exhausted and calls for police to notify the Crisis Intervention Team, so that Anderson’s team can plan a visit, he said, “and get them the resources they need.” 
A new push to change California law on mental health crises response
Back in Sacramento County, behavioral health and Metro Fire officials say they have begun talks with Sheriff Cooper’s department to map out a path forward. The review commission has empaneled a committee to examine the legal interpretations of Scott v. Smith, Cooper’s rollout of the policy, and the protocols regarding when his department will and won’t respond. 
The committee has also been digging into the February incident involving Susanna’s daughter. She had called into the commission meeting 11 days later, to describe her horror at the lack of response, given her daughter’s threats and the knife Susanna saw in her hand. But there is a dispute. In an interview, Susanna’s husband said he’s “pretty sure I said she went and grabbed a knife.” 
He said he was adamant about wanting to press charges. But, he said, the supervisor told him,“‘We don’t step in on mental calls.’ I said, ‘Well it’s assault.’ And he said she has to actually hit you guys for it to be assault.” 
While his 911 call to the dispatch center was recorded, the supervisor’s follow up calls were not. But the summary log of the incident, which the Sheriff’s Department provided to CalMatters, paints a different picture. “Not holding any knives or potential weapons,” it states. The husband, it concludes, “stated he does not wish to pursue charges.” 
“There’s no accountability. They can say the sky was green and we have to go with it.”Susanna, who wants supervisors’ calls on mental health crisis to be recorded
Susanna’s first idea for reform: that those calls from supervisors, who according to policy make the final decision on whether to respond to mental health crisis calls, be recorded. 
“There’s no accountability,” she said. “They can say the sky was green and we have to go with it.”
A sheriff’s spokesperson would only say that the family is no doubt “going through a lot.” He confirmed that calls made from outside the dispatch center are not recorded, but said it’s a practice they may explore down the road.  
Meanwhile, family advocates of those with serious mental illness, among them Polony, Hopper and Wentzel, have been meeting with state legislators to craft a potential bill that would allay law enforcement liability concerns and enable clinicians to more easily call for involuntary 5150 holds. A similar bill failed to advance last year. 
For his part, Sheriff Cooper described the policy as a “work in progress. 
“We’re open minded. We’re not totally entrenched,” he said. “At the end of the day, I want everybody to go home safe. I don’t want to ever have to take someone’s life or have one of my deputies do that. That’s the most important outcome for everybody. And it’s tough. It’s not the same old business as usual, and people are having a hard time swallowing it.”

Private developers are working with the Massachusetts Port Authority on a proposal to expand Hanscom’s private jet capacity with 17 new hangars, the accompanying fuel tanks, and other infrastructure. A coalition of neighbors and environmentalists had been working since at least 2023 to oppose the plan with petitions, meetings with representatives, and yard[...]","YOU MAY WONDER how a peaceful well-behaved middle-aged academic found himself handcuffed and arrested along with 20 others last year at Hanscom Airfield.  Hanscom sits about 20 miles northwest of Boston in Bedford, on 1,300 acres along the town’s borders with Concord, Lexington, and Lincoln. It abuts the 3,700-acre Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge and is New England’s largest general aviation airfield for private jets, flying lessons, and the like.  Across a quiet country road from the airfield sits the birthplace of Henry David Thoreau. It seems an unlikely place for a ruckus.  Yet, quite a loud fight is brewing there. Private developers are working with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort) on a proposal to expand Hanscom’s private jet capacity with 17 new hangars, the accompanying fuel tanks, and other infrastructure. A coalition of neighbors and environmentalists had been working since at least 2023 to oppose the plan with petitions, meetings with representatives, and yard signs, without success.  In April 2024, about 20 of us went to Hanscom Airfield, held signs, sang songs, and gave speeches explaining our purpose, first at three private jet companies and then, after we were arrested, while sitting on the roadside curb in handcuffs. The Hanscom expansion would reverse one important element of Massachusetts’s famously progressive environmental policy. Massachusetts rightly gets credit for making partial progress on the first two out of three well-known fundamental principles for a climate-friendly energy system, which I teach in my class on climate change in the Environmental Studies program at Tufts University: (1) electrify everything that can be electrified, (2) make the electric grid green, and (3) reduce demand in a few difficult-to-electrify sectors such as aviation. State law has a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, which requires a rapid reduction and eventually a nearly complete stop in burning the fossil fuels that generate climate-damaging greenhouse gas pollution. To meet this goal, Massachusetts invests in electricity from green solar and wind power, and in new electric heat pumps to replace fossil fuel systems for residences and businesses, and more. When the Commonwealth boasted of meeting its interim 2020 goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (25 percent below 1990 levels), 95 percent of the progress came just from the electric power and building sectors. Sadly, the expansion at Hanscom would undermine the third principle about reducing demand in difficult-to-electrify sectors such as aviation. The success in meeting the 2020 goal was 5 years ago. Meeting the Commonwealth’s next interim goal for 2030 (50 percent below 1990) will require progress in more sectors than just electricity and buildings. Converting to green electricity is challenging for transportation and effectively impossible for aviation. Jet fuel provides 20 to 50 times as much energy per pound as even the most advanced electric batteries, which remain too heavy to power full-sized airplanes. And the so-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) each have flaws. Some SAFs come from biofuels that compete with food production, contributing to food price inflation and world hunger. Other more advanced SAFs are expensive enough that adopting them would still require less flying overall. As an alternative to technological fantasies of battery-powered flight, reducing demand in the difficult-to-electrify aviation sector would be more feasible than many people realize. For example, in higher education, which is a major industry in Massachusetts, I am the co-organizer of an initiative encouraging universities to set goals and measure progress for reducing flying, as part of their annual environmental reporting. During the COVID pandemic, universities temporarily made excellent progress using remote communication technologies. As an experimental proof of concept, I stopped flying myself in 2014 and was delighted to discover new ways of traveling overland for work and for recreation. Zero is not the right amount of flying for everybody, but this experiment illustrates the potential for ambitious reductions proportional to the seriousness of the climate challenge. Far from helping, Massachusetts authorities actively make aviation pollution worse. For Logan International Airport in Boston, the largest airport in New England, MassPort is expanding infrastructure and underreporting greenhouse gas emissions. In Logan’s Environmental Status and Planning Report, the table on greenhouse gas pollution counts only jet fuel burned during takeoffs and landings, a small fraction of the total. An appendix to the same document reports the true amount of fossil jet fuel sold at Logan, 443 million gallons in 2022, which is enough to generate 4.26 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, more than 6 percent of all Massachusetts greenhouse gases. And that’s just the jet fuel. It doesn’t count the emissions from ground operations, manufacturing the airplanes, and the “radiative forcing” effect, which further enhances the climate damage. As a fraction of the state total, aviation emissions from Logan have recovered from their Covid-era slump and now are setting new records. In this context, it would be absurd for Massachusetts to double the capacity at Hanscom Airfield specifically for private planes serving a plutocratic elite. Greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile are much higher for private jets than for commercial airlines, which are much higher in turn than for buses or electric trains. After the new infrastructure is built, private jets from Hanscom would produce enough greenhouse gas pollution to undo the benefit from 70% of the solar panels installed in Massachusetts. The project’s environmental impact statement failed to report the full extent of its greenhouse gas pollution and invented without evidence large purported savings from reduced “ferry” flights of empty private jets between nearby airports. The report was so fundamentally flawed that it was rejected by state officials and sent back for a complete resubmission. You can see why 20 friends and I felt obliged to object to expanding private jets at Hanscom Airfield. If there had been any alternative to public protest, I would have used it. I am a scholar, not a fighter. Before speaking up at Hanscom Airfield, I had never been arrested in my life. Now, at great expense in time and money, Massachusetts has scheduled individual trials in Concord District Court beginning May 13 and running through the summer. My own trial is scheduled for May 27.  So we have come to the point of decision. In this time of national crisis, will the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stand up for climate justice and meet its next interim climate goal for 2030? Or will it accelerate aviation pollution, understate the emissions, obey the billionaires, and prosecute the 21 good citizens who raised their voice and said, “This is wrong”? Parke Wilde is a professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. He will be on trial in Concord District Court May 27, on charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct related to a peaceful protest against the proposed expansion of private jet infrastructure at Hanscom Airfield in Eastern Massachusetts.The post Why We Were in Handcuffs at Hanscom Airfield appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hanscom-protest.webp?fit=1024%2C752&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 09:08:44.284178

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)This Chesapeake Bay wetland could be an environmental crystal ball.
With infrared lamps pointed down at marsh grasses — and heating cables placed beneath them — the environment is 5.1 degrees Celsius hotter than the surrounding area, simulating a future world warmed by climate change.
In nearby sections of marsh, carbon dioxide is pumped into structures that look like mini, open-air greenhouses.
“You’re never going to get a warmer world without also having higher CO2 in the atmosphere,” said Genevieve Noyce, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, which runs the wetland site.
The wetland is just a few miles from the Research Center’s headquarters in Edgewater, nestled in a crook of the Rhode River. And it has become a hotbed — pun intended — for several experiments that mimic global warming.
The latest research to emerge from the Global Change Research Wetland, or GCREW, was published last week in Science Advances, a peer-reviewed journal. That study captured data for five years, focused not on the wetland’s growth, but on its emissions.

But one of the experiments here has been ongoing since 1987, leading the center to pronounce that it’s likely the world’s longest-running field experiment simulating carbon dioxide elevation.
The researchers found that adding carbon dioxide stimulated the wetland’s growth by about 30% — and allowed its long grasses to start growing earlier in the springtime and stay green farther into the fall. Some years, the grasses can make it until December before they turn entirely brown, said Andrew Peresta, the site’s operations manager.
But nearly 40 years after the experiment’s beginning, Mother Nature is playing scientist, and adding new conditions to the simulation, Peresta said. Rising water levels, a handful of millimeters each year, have begun to change the story, slowing the rate of increased grass growth.
“All of these plants are adapted to grow with their roots in wet soil. But if it’s too wet — if the sea level comes up too fast — and they can’t keep up, then they start struggling,” Noyce said.
The study’s long time horizon has allowed scientists to document the marsh’s changes over time, including incursions by invasive phragmites, Peresta said.
“A lot of projects are only two to three years long,” Peresta said. “You might not learn as much as you do with this.”
Collectively, coastal wetland environments are among the world’s greatest carbon sinks. According to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration webpage, they annually trap carbon at a rate 10 times greater than mature tropical forests, preventing the harmful gases from reaching the atmosphere, where they contribute to warming.
But wetlands also release methane, a greenhouse gas that is about 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
  The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center’s experimental wetland includes plenty of heating lamps, and pods where carbon dioxide is also added to simulate the effects of climate change. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)
Traditionally, wetlands have been considered minor producers of the gas. But the Smithsonian researchers have discovered that raising the temperature of the wetland, with the submerged heaters and overhead lamps, speeds up methane production by about four times, compared to the undisturbed wetlands close by, Noyce said.
The same was true when researchers added carbon dioxide to the equation, except the increase was less dramatic — about 1.5 times. In other words, if climate change gets worse, it could tip off a domino effect in the wetlands, yielding more emissions that further worsen global warming.
“We knew there was something with adding elevated CO2 to reduce the amount of methane coming out of the plots. But we didn’t really know why,” Noyce said.
So the researchers looked to the microbial community in the soil beneath the wetland. There, some microbes produce methane, but others consume it.
Climate change seems to change the fine balance between these two types of microbes, increasing the methane that is released, said Jaehyun Lee, who was the study’s lead author as a post-doctoral researcher at the Smithsonian Center.
When carbon dioxide was added to the plots, it stimulated root growth, increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil. This gave more fuel to the microbes that consume methane by oxidizing it, Lee said. Their activity canceled out some of the effect from hotter temperatures, which spurred the methane-producing microbes, causing methane emissions to spike.
Even with the increased methane emissions, it seems likely that wetlands will still store more globe-warming emissions than they release, Lee said. But the research proves that the balance is delicate, and could potentially flip in the other direction, said Lee, who is now a senior researcher at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.

Since 2016, experiments in Noyce’s section of the wetland, known as SMARTX, or the Salt Marsh Accretion Response to Temperature Experiment, have been funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. It remains unclear whether the funding will be impacted by recent Trump administration cuts to scientific research, particularly that which focuses on climate change.
The wetland receives three years of funding at a time, and is currently in its last year of the cycle, Noyce said. The team just applied for another three years, she said.
The 1987 project is funded by a National Science Foundation grant for long-term research in environmental biology, she said.
The new data could help improve the accuracy of climate change modeling, as researchers attempt to predict the amount of globe-warming gases that will be emitted, Lee said.
“When we set the the goal for carbon reduction in the future, to slow down the temperature rise, we also have to consider these types of changes in methane emissions,” Lee said. Otherwise, governments could struggle to reach their carbon reduction goals, he said.
The findings, released Wednesday, could also inform wetland plantings and restoration efforts, Noyce said.
“If you can start understanding which plant communities are going to respond in different ways under global change, then you can say: ‘Oh, maybe this plant community is going to be better. It might reduce the amount of methane coming out of this sort of ecosystem,’” Noyce said.

Just like that, Huertero and her adult son — whose medical issues prevent him from working — had to find a new place to live. She said she ended up homeless for the next six months, temporarily bunking with her daughter in Tooele. Also having been a domestic violence victim, she said she turned to South Valley Services for assistance, which eventually helped her obtain an Emergency Housing Voucher for rental assistance.

The Emergency Housing Voucher program, launched in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, used $5 billion in federal funds to help house vulnerable people — those who are homeless, at risk of homelessness, or are trying to flee domestic violence or other dangerous situations, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
Since then, Huertero said that voucher has helped keep a roof over her and her family’s head. Currently, she lives on a multiplex in Salt Lake City with her elderly aunt and her adult son, both of whom rely on her as a caretaker. She works at a local housing authority — where she helps people like herself get housing assistance, trying to “give back” in as many ways as she can.
But without the voucher, which she said pays for roughly half of their $2,200 rent, Huertero wouldn’t know what to do. 
“Oh my gosh, if we didn’t have that, we probably wouldn’t be able to make rent,” she said, adding that even with the rental assistance she at times struggles to make ends meet between the cost of utilities, groceries and gas for her commute.  
Huertero — who was born in San Diego and moved to Utah decades ago, in 1996, in search of a better life — is one of hundreds of Utahns who could lose their Emergency Housing Voucher assistance earlier than expected unless Congress acts. 
But the program, faced with rising housing costs, is quickly running out of money. Federal officials expect the funds to run dry by the end of 2026, according to a letter HUD sent to housing agencies across the country, including those in Utah. It advised housing authorities to “manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.” 
How many vouchers are at risk in Utah?
At least 281 vouchers are currently being used in Utah, according to HUD’s website. That number is small compared to other states like California, where nearly 15,500 vouchers are at risk, according to the Associated Press. In total, roughly 60,000 people across the country could lose their rental assistance and face eviction at the end of next year unless Congress sets more money aside for the program. 
Janice Kimball, CEO of Housing Connect (Salt Lake County’s housing authority) received one of those letters from HUD. In Salt Lake County, Emergency Housing Vouchers are helping keep at least 97 people or families housed. 
“I think for this fiscal year, we’re probably OK,” she told Utah News Dispatch. “But we’re really worried about next fiscal year.”

Looking ahead to when the funds are set to expire in 2026, Kimball said “we’re trying to figure out how to keep those folks housed” by transitioning them or absorbing them into other programs, wherever possible. The vast majority of Utahns receiving assistance through Housing Connect do so with Section 8 vouchers, which Kimball said support about 3,000 households.
But without more federal dollars, she said Salt Lake County would not be able to sustain its 97 Emergency Housing Vouchers long term.

“We don’t have enough of our own funds to do that,” she said, adding that the average cost per unit the vouchers help fund cost about $1,110 per month, “so we’re spending just over $110,000 per month to keep those households housed.” 
The Housing Authority of Salt Lake City has also distributed a big chunk of Utah’s Emergency Housing Vouchers. Currently, 77 vouchers are being used, according to Britnee Dabb, deputy director of Salt Lake City’s housing authority. 
Though Dabb said the authority has been allocated funding for 98 vouchers, she said her team has moved some of the households to other long-term programs they qualify for instead of waiting for the funds to expire. 
But as for the other 77 still in use? 
“If we can’t find programs that the households qualify for and are open, these families will lose the rent subsidy and have a large probability of becoming homeless,” Dabb said. 
What now?
To not cause a panic, Kimball said Housing Connect hasn’t been notifying renters just yet of the program’s expiration date, given there’s still so much uncertainty around what federal officials and Congress could do next. 
In the meantime, she said “we’re hoping that we’ll get additional information from HUD, and we’re hoping that we’ll have an idea of future funding, because that gives us the tools to know what we can do and what we can’t do.”

Salt Lake County Housing Authority: 97
Salt Lake City Housing Authority: 77
Provo Housing Authority: 27
Utah County Housing Authority: 32
Carbon County Housing Authority: 6
St. George Housing Authority: 17
Cedar City Housing Authority: 12




“The other thing that’s really frustrating is that Congress has not passed a budget for 2025, so we’re operating on information that we think is current based on last year,” she said. 
Since the program isn’t expected to end until around November 2026, Kimball added “we have a little bit of time to kind of think this through. So we’re hoping we can have the budget numbers in before we have to start making those calls.” 
Still, she worries the program’s expiration will cause a setback during a time when housing in Utah and across the country continues to be a painful issue for so many Utahns and Americans.
“Right now, there’s such a deficit of affordable housing that it’s really hard for low-income households to be able to find a stable place to live,” she said. “We should be adding to the mix to help families stay housed. And so, any resource that you remove from the community is detrimental.” 
Kimball said housing authorities are “going to do everything they can to keep people housed,” but she said now is a “good time” for Utahns to reach out to their congressional leaders and “let them know what the value of housing is for you and your family.” 
In the past, when voucher programs have been awarded and expire, they are usually extended, Kimball said, “and it’s because of this reason: once you get households or families entered into leases, it’s hard to unwind that. Usually it’s just been extended.” 
But under Trump’s administration and the GOP-controlled Congress, it’s unclear whether that will happen. 
Kimball said the Emergency Housing Voucher program has helped hundreds of Utahns move from unstable housing or homelessness, to a safe, affordable situation.










I can’t believe, honestly, that they would (stop) that funding. I mean, this population that I’m included in. We’re really vulnerable. We’ve been through a lot mentally.

“They have some choice in where they can live. It gives them breathing room. … They can start building from there,” she said. “Affordable housing is like the foundational game changer. It really keeps people stable and allows them to live.” 
Kimball said she “can’t even imagine having to tell these households that we can’t house them.” Though it hasn’t come to that, at least not yet, Kimball said she does worry it would be “devastating” to those renters. 
While Utah’s number of Emergency Housing Vouchers is small compared to other states, to Huertero, it would be life altering.

She said she’s been working hard to complete HUD’s five-year Family Self-Sufficiency Program — which helps teach budgeting, saving and other financial goals while setting aside money whenever Huertero gets a salary bump in an escrow account that she can later use to buy a home. But she said she probably has another four years before she could graduate from that program. 
If the Emergency Housing Voucher program expires, Huertero worries she’ll be forced to go back on affordable housing waitlists. 
“I’m going to get on any wait list I can, just in case,” she said. 
Thinking about thousands of others like her who are at risk losing their rental assistance, Huertero choked back tears. 
“I can’t believe, honestly, that they would (stop) that funding. I mean, this population that I’m included in. We’re really vulnerable. We’ve been through a lot mentally,” she said. “I’m really struggling to try to understand all this.”
She acknowledged that President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to reign in federal spending, but pointing to chaos and uncertainty around other frozen funds or cuts, Huertero said she wishes the approach could be more compassionate. 
“I get that, yeah, there are some things that really do need to change,” she said. “But it didn’t need to change all in one day, all in one month. You know, he has four years to make these changes.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Alabama arts programs may face up to $1 million in cuts if the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts funds for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).
The Alabama Council of the Arts said earlier this month it is anticipating cuts at the federal level soon. They said that representatives from DOGE were scheduled to visit NEA offices.
“Any cuts to federal funding for state partnerships would directly impact our grant programs, reducing our available funds by up to $1 million annually,” Executive Director Elliot Knight said in a statement Wednesday.
According to the Council, the NEA makes up 15% of its budget with the rest coming from the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund (ETF). The 2026 ETF received approval from the House on Tuesday, which included an $85,000 increase from the current budget and Gov. Kay Ivey’s 2026 recommendation.
The Council awarded $14.7 million in grants over the last five years, according to the statement. Knight also said the Council uses 100% of its federal funds for grants.
“Public funding for arts and creativity is a high-return investment that ensures all Alabamians have access to arts programming,” Knight said.
The federal cuts would have to be approved by Congress. 
“Please help us make sure that all members of Alabama’s Congressional delegation understand how Alabama workers and communities will be negatively impacted by the cuts to NEH and IMLS grants and potential cuts to NEA grants,” Knight said.
According to the statement, Poetry Out Loud is one program funded with federal dollars. The national arts education program that encourages high school students to learn about great poetry through memorization, performance and competition. Knight said this is one of the programs that would be impacted by NEA cuts.
“The arts are more than just an expression of beauty; they are a driver of innovation, contributing to Alabama’s economic growth and global competitiveness,” he said.

(Getty Images)As high summer temperatures start to creep across the state, about $1.4 million in federal funding meant to help low-income Nevadans pay utility bills is in limbo after the Trump administration fired every employee responsible for administering the funds.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) terminated the entire staff that allocates funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) as part of a broad effort by the White House to dramatically downsize the federal government. 
Federal funding for LIHEAP is approved by Congress and funneled through state programs which use the money to pay energy providers directly in order to help low-income families avoid shutoffs.
Consumer advocates warn that the layoffs could threaten or delay nearly $400 million in utility assistance funding that had not yet been distributed to states by the time the federal program was gutted. 
Nevada was awarded about $15 million in LIHEAP funding this year, but about $1.4 million of that funding is now in limbo after the program was essentially shuttered in early April. 
According to the Nevada Division of Welfare and Supportive Services — which administers the state’s LIHEAP funding —Nevada has not received the remaining 10% of its allocated funding as of Thursday. 
Earlier this month, Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen and several other Democratic senators sent a letter to HHS urging the agency to disburse all of the LIHEAP funds that Congress has appropriated.
“By terminating all 23 employees tasked with overseeing LIHEAP, it is now unclear how these funds will be administered. In our view, that is unacceptable,” reads the letter. “Failure to disburse these funds constitutes an illegal impoundment of bipartisan, congressionally appropriated funds and will put the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable people in America at risk.”
HHS did not respond to a request for comment on the fate of Nevada’s remaining funding.
Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program received more than half its funding from LIHEAP last year, making it a vital source of utility assistance funding for the state.
Last year, Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program paid out more than $31 million in benefits to help more than 17,000 households in the state keep their power on. A portion of those funds were also used to help low-income households pay for upgrades that improve energy efficiency and lower power bills in the long term.
Still, as temperatures rise there is a growing demand for utility assistance funding in the state. Nearly 32,000 Nevadans had their power disconnected by NV Energy for nonpayment in 2024, according to data from the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
In southern Nevada, where temperatures reached 100 degrees or higher for 64 consecutive days in 2024, air conditioning is a life-saving necessity.
Extreme heat exposure is a serious health hazard. It can cause heat rash, cramps, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke, which can be fatal or have lifelong consequences. Older people, people with disabilities, pregnant people, and children are at increased risk of adverse health impacts from heat.
Without the remaining 10% of Nevada’s LIHEAP funding, the state won’t be able to provide financial assistance to as many households struggling to pay their energy bills.
The state’s ability to provide energy assistance could be reduced even more in 2026, as the Trump administration has signaled it could end the program next year. A leaked draft budget request document from the HHS proposes allocating zero funding for the LIHEAP program in 2026, according to reporting by the Hill. 
The U.S. Constitution puts Congress, not the president, in charge of federal spending, but the Trump administration has been challenging congressional power of the purse, with little pushback from Republicans in control of the legislative branch.
The administration’s  termination of LIHEAP programs and staff is raising alarms for consumer advocates. 
Keriann Conroy, a research associate with the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog organization, said any reduction in LIHEAP funding could be especially devastating for Nevada.
“It’s the main source of energy assistance funding that exists both nationwide and in the state of Nevada,” Conroy said. 
“This is absolutely a program people depend on. I think you’ll see the most vulnerable people being disconnected and being put in life threatening circumstances,” Conroy said. “Since most Nevadans are already struggling to pay their utility bills you’d see that extend to a larger group of people.”
Reno and Las Vegas are the two fastest-warming cities in the country, according to climate scientists at Climate Central. Heat played a role in the deaths of 527 people last year in Southern Nevada alone, according to the Southern Nevada Health District.
Yet, Nevada’s customer protections against utility companies disconnecting consumers during extreme weather are limited.
Nevada is one of 19 states that does not require utilities to publicly disclose the number of customers they disconnect to utility regulators, leaving little transparency to understand the full extent of disconnections. However, Nevada lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would require utilities to report disconnections by month and zip code.
Nevada also does not have a blanket moratorium on utility disconnections during months of extreme weather, like many other states do, including neighboring Arizona. 
“If LIHEAP assistance disappears, it will add insult to injury in a state with limited consumer protections. Nevada’s customer protections against utility companies disconnecting consumers during extreme weather are limited,” Conroy said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/electric-meter-1024x752.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 08:11:04.584635

On Wednesday, the Alaska Senate voted 20-0 to change state law and require that Alaska’s Big Game Commercial Services Board have a permanent executive director.
The board is in charge of licensing commercial hunting guides, assistant guides and transporters. 
Since 2024, the state budget has included funding for a temporary executive director, but if Senate Bill 29 becomes law, the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development would be required to have a permanent executive director for the big game board. 
Several other regulated industries already have boards with permanent executive directors, and the cost of the director would be paid for with fees, said Sen. Jesse Bjorkman, R-Nikiski and the sponsor of SB 29.
The bill was supported by Safari Club International, the Alaska Professional Hunters Association and other trade groups.
SB 29 is awaiting a hearing in the House Resources Committee.

Ruby Hurley opened the first permanent office of the NAACP in the South. 
Her introduction to civil rights activism began when she helped organize Marian Anderson’s 1939 concert at the Lincoln Memorial. Four years later, she became national youth secretary for the NAACP. In 1951, she opened the organization’s office in Birmingham to grow memberships in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. 
When she arrived in Mississippi, there were only 800 NAACP members. After the governor made remarks she disagreed with, she wrote a letter to the editor that was published in a Mississippi newspaper. After that step in courage, membership grew to 4,000. 
“They were surprised and glad to find someone to challenge the governor,” she told the Chicago Defender. “No Negro had ever challenged the governor before.” 
She helped Medgar Evers investigate the 1955 murder of Emmett Till and other violence against Black Americans. Despite threats, she pushed on. 
“When you’re in the middle of these situations, there’s no room for fear,” she said. “If you have fear in your heart or mind, you can’t do a good job.” 
After an all-white jury acquitted Till’s killers, she appeared on the front cover of Jet magazine with the headline, “Most Militant Negro Woman in the South.” 
Months later, she helped Autherine Lucy become the first Black student at the University of Alabama. 
For her work, she received many threats, including a bombing attempt on her home. She opened an NAACP office in Atlanta, where she served as a mentor for civil rights leader Vernon Jordan, with whom she worked extensively and who went on to serve as an adviser to President Bill Clinton. 
After learning of Evers’ assassination in 1963, she became overwhelmed with sorrow. “I cried for three hours,” she said. “I shall always remember that pool of blood in which he lay and that spattered blood over the car where he tried to drag himself into the house.”

It’s my annual reminder that we still have Confederate Memorial Day, one of three state holidays honoring men who killed American soldiers in defense of white supremacy.

That’s what the Confederacy was about, and it’s never been a secret. Ulysses S. Grant wrote in his memoirs that the Southern cause was “one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse.”
He added that he did not question “the sincerity of the great mass of those who were opposed to us.”
Neither do I. These men were honest in their racism like a vulture is straightforward about its plans for a dying animal.
Some may consider that impolite. Many believe that the South’s profound inhumanity was a kind of trick pulled off by elites. In this telling, the people at the top invented or extended racism to keep poor whites, whose griefs came from the enslavers and not the enslaved, distracted and unable to form potentially powerful class-based alliances. Gaslit into confusion, lower-class whites became the unthinking tools of the aristocrat pulling strings from a secure perch.
If this was the whole tale, Reconstruction would have been as challenging as a home remodeling project.  Swap Slaveholder A for Public Servant B. Alabama’s myriad issues with education and public health — all of which have roots in slavery — would be far less dire.
The problem is that it treats racism as little more than a tool for rich whites and a fog around poor ones. With a little time and a bit of sunshine, the mists of hatred would evaporate and people would see the world clearly.
But nearly all whites, whether rich or poor, chose to drink from the same polluted well. The poison seeped into their blood and penetrated their bones. It left many white men convinced that their own roles leading their households depended on keeping Black Americans in bondage.
“The hidden assumptions and values that underlay their political choices were forged in the relationships that engaged them most directly,” the historian Stephanie McCurry wrote in “Masters of Small Worlds.” “With the few slaves they may have owned, but, just as importantly, with the women and other family dependents they presumed it their natural right to rule. Whether slaveholders or not, yeoman household heads were, as they proudly proclaimed, masters.”
Maybe the ordinary farmer didn’t like the slaveholder’s house or his allies shifting taxes to him. But when the rich man spoke of domination and order, he heard his own dark thoughts. He saw a peer.
And when those elites declared war on the federal government, he picked up a gun, grabbed starvation-level rations and killed American soldiers. And he sang all the way.
The brackish water of racism freed him from any concern about his position or any desire for something better. In his mind, liberty grew from the chain on a Black American. That was worth a bullet or a fatal illness in a filthy tent.
Lewis Parsons, the governor of Alabama, estimated after the war that 122,000 Alabamians — more than a fifth of the prewar white population — took up arms for racism. Somewhere between 27,000 and 35,000 of them died for it. (Perhaps 3,000 white Alabamians fought for the Union, while 5,000 Black Alabamians took on the blue.)
Tens of thousands more were injured. God knows how much undiagnosed trauma went home to their families, their children and future generations.
Given the choice, I would fire every single Confederate holiday into the sun. But if the state insists on having them, we may look at those men decaying beneath the Stars and Bars and reflect on where embracing authoritarianism leads.
Decades of family and children and love cleaved by hate and ended by a firearm, a shell or a virus.
Lives reduced to a flag without a country and a cause no decent person honors.
A pointless sacrifice to the fickle god of malice.
Today we see many people surrounding the poisoned well that fed that destruction, pushing and shoving to get a taste.
Drink from it, and almost everything else falls away. The economy burns, and the rule of law dies, but they have a sense of peace. They smile as corruption thrives and their savings evaporate. Nothing matters except their rapturous vision of a person with brown skin suffering.
In that hateful daze, they nod as the administration locks people up without trial. While scholars are hounded. And as the bright future down a more difficult path fades away.
What comes of that? What does it leave behind?
A graveyard. A field of faded tombstones in dead soil, acidic from the hatred leaching out of the buried bones.
And on this sterile ground, the Confederate flags bloom.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House Health Committee Wednesday approved a bill raising the age of consent for medical care from 14 to 16.
SB 101, sponsored by Sen. Larry Stutts, R-Tuscumbia, would require parental consent for medical, dental, and mental health services for minors under 16 and prohibit health care providers and governmental entities from denying parents access to a child’s health record.
“Since 1972, the age of consent for all medical care in Alabama, from dental health to general health to mental health, has been 14 years of age, and this bill seeks to raise it to 16,” said Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, who is handling the legislation in the House.

DuBose said that although the bill would have originally raised the age of consent to 18 years, she and Stutts worked with the medical community to arrive at the compromise.
 “I understand the concerns of all these medical professionals, and while I may not have wanted 16 to begin with, I wanted 18. We all did. This is far better than 14, and I think sometimes that’s what we end up doing on legislation, is working with everybody and coming to the best compromise that we can all live with,” DuBose said.
She added that a key part of the bill is ensuring that parents can access their minor child’s medical records.
“The good thing about this bill is it does provide parents with access to all medical records of their minor child, and so I’m very happy with that,” she said.
The bill provides several exemptions to the age of consent requirement. Minors under 16 who are pregnant or emancipated can make their own medical decisions. Minors under 16 can also consent to services related to sexually transmitted diseases and alcohol or drug misuse. Health care professionals would also be allowed to provide emergency services without parental consent under specific circumstances, including imminent threats to the minor’s health, suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation.
“We try to have common sense carve outs in this law,” DuBose said in a phone interview Friday.
The bill can now be considered by the full House.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Doctor makes case for expanding Nevada Medicaid coverage of anti-obesity drugs

Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wegovy.jpg,,,2025-04-28 09:08:44.284178

Medicaid is the country’s biggest health plan, covering more than 70 million Americans. Known as HUSKY in Connecticut, Medicaid covers roughly 1 million people in the state, according to the Department of Social Services, which equals just about 25% of the population. 
States depend heavily on the federal government to pay for the program. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projects Connecticut will spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid this fiscal year. The federal government contributed roughly $6.9 billion, or 59%, of that funding.
Democrats across the country are sounding the alarm that the Trump administration’s budget priorities will threaten the federal funding that’s critical to Medicaid. Both chambers of the U.S. Congress recently passed a measure crafted by Republicans that instructed the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending. 
The resolution doesn’t direct the committee to cut Medicaid specifically, and President Donald J. Trump has insisted that his administration will not cut the program. But, based on the spending that the committee handles, Medicaid would likely need to be part of the equation, which could lead to reductions in access for enrollees. 
Here’s what you need to know.
What will the cuts mean for providers and patients?
Medicaid covers all types of services for its enrollees, including medical and behavioral health services, substance abuse treatment, as well as in-home and nursing home care for seniors and people with disabilities. It’s unlikely that we’ll know the full details of how Medicaid cuts will play out until the summer, when Congress is expected to vote on the final budget for fiscal year 2026. 
“There’s all kinds of ideas swirling around about how they would implement [cuts]. They’re all bad,” U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said during a press conference in Hartford earlier this month.
Providers are already bracing for the changes, saying they may have to pare back services if cuts go through.
Glenn Connan, chief financial officer at Midwestern Connecticut Council on Alcoholism, a substance abuse treatment provider in Danbury, said he worries his organization would have to shutter some of its clinics, despite surging demand for services.
“Any further cuts to Medicaid [and] we’re gonna have to start closing some of those seven outpatient clinics and just having maybe three,” Connan told elected officials during an event earlier this month in Danbury focused on potential Medicaid cuts. “That’s gonna hurt the people in those communities.”
Jeffrey Shenberger, division head of neonatology at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, said Medicaid cuts would impact some of his most vulnerable patients — babies in the neonatal intensive care unit. 
“Cuts would lead to fewer resources within the acute care process within the NICU. And it would impact all families and all children. It’s regardless of whether they’re private pay, self-pay or paid through Medicaid,” Shenberger told attendees during an April press conference at Connecticut Children’s in Hartford.
Medicaid covers roughly 40% of births in Connecticut, according to health policy organization KFF.
How would Medicaid cuts impact state finances?
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration is modeling out what the cuts to Medicaid would mean for the state budget. While it’s unclear how the federal government would pare back spending, the impacts of all cuts Congress is considering would put enormous stress on the state’s finances. 
Right now, the federal government covers at least 50% of all the state’s Medicaid costs. But, Congress may decide to, instead, offer a fixed amount per Medicaid enrollee, regardless of how many or which types of services they use. Under this scenario, Connecticut would lose $1.35 billion over the next seven years, or an average of $193 million per year, according to the Department of Social Services.
The feds may also lower or abandon the current guarantee that Washington reimburses at least 50% of all states’ Medicaid costs. In that case, Connecticut stands to lose up to a staggering $3.5 billion in federal reimbursements, DSS estimates. The funding represents just over half of the projected federal reimbursements Connecticut received this fiscal year.
Officials have said it’s too early to focus on how the state might trim Medicaid under some nightmare scenario. But, there are benefits that Connecticut offers that aren’t required for states to participate in Medicaid. These include dental and pharmaceutical coverage, and home care for elderly patients.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, who co-chairs the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee, told The Connecticut Mirror she isn’t ready to accept any cutbacks.
“We’re not pre-supposing …  in a program as important as Medicaid,” Osten said. “We’re not going to start off looking at cuts to programs that keep people alive — and that’s what Medicaid does.”

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Almost a year ago, I received news that no one ever wants to hear — that my colleague Parole and Probation Agent Davis Martinez had been killed during a home visit. He was the first agent to be killed in the line of duty in Maryland.
Brother Martinez was a beloved coworker, brother and son. He was an active member of his union, AFSCME Local 3661, which represents thousands of state employees who work in public safety and community corrections. For the last year, my fellow union members and I have been mourning his loss, and we are still deeply hurt and angry at the departmental and policy failures that led to this tragedy.
Sadly, Brother Martinez was not alone. In 2024, our union also lost Brother Ronald Silver II and Brother Timothy Cartwell. They were both sanitation workers for Baltimore City’s Department of Public Works, and both died from preventable incidents while on the job.

We know there are dangers that come with our professions, but the glaring truth is that for too long, Maryland’s public employers have failed to make the health and safety of their employees a priority. Public sector workers in Maryland consistently face more than double the rates of occupational injuries and illnesses of their private sector counterparts, 5.4 cases compared to 2.3 cases per 100 full-time workers, respectively.
But for the first time, my fellow union members and I have some hope.
This year, our union was successful in passing the Davis Martinez Public Employee Safety and Health Act, sponsored by Sen. Ben Kramer (D-Montgomery) and Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery). This legislation marks a critical turning point in our fight for safe and healthy workplaces.
For years, Maryland law has failed to hold public sector employers accountable for violating workplace safety standards. While private sector employers can face financial penalties, public sector employers are simply given a slap on the wrist, even though our safety is entrusted to them from the moment we clock in. The Davis Martinez Act changes that.
This important legislation will hold all public employers accountable for the safety of their workers and add in financial consequences for failing to protect employees. With the Davis Martinez Act, Maryland will now become only the third state in the nation — joining New York and California — to require a Workplace Violence Prevention standard that covers the entire public sector.
On this Workers’ Memorial Day, a day where we remember those who have lost their lives or been injured or made sick on the job, I can’t help but reflect on the lives that could have been saved had our public sector employers been proactive in creating and enforcing policies and procedures to keep us safe on the job.
In honor of the legacies of our fallen union brothers, it’s up to us to make Maryland a state that truly values the lives, safety, and health of each and every worker. In honor of Brother Martinez, Brother Silver and Brother Cartwell, we expect every public sector employer to work collaboratively with us, the workers who keep Maryland running, to implement these key reforms in good faith, because everyone deserves to return home safely from work at the end of the day.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DSC_0097-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 08:11:04.584635

Access to affordable child care is something that concerns all Vermonters, even those who do not have children.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mirna Valerio: I Love Vermont for Its Mountains — and Its Commitment to Child Care.","This commentary is by Mirna Valerio. She is a Winooski-based ultrarunner, advocate for the outdoors and author of the book “A Beautiful Work in Progress.” As an athlete and advocate for the outdoors, I was attracted to Vermont’s incredible mountains, its stewardship of natural resources, its quirky downtowns with local bookstores and cafes, rural landscapes with farm stands and fresh zucchini…lots and lots of zucchini. But the primary reason for choosing to settle my family in the Green Mountain State was because of its values — including its commitment to progress on child care. Vermont is full of hardy folk who take action for the benefit of their community. Because of the hard work of over 40,000 Vermonters, our state has become a national leader on child care. Act 76 — the 2023 law that provides desperately-needed, long-term funding for accessible and affordable child care — has emerged as one of the most transformative actions on child care at the state-level. Access to affordable child care is something that concerns all Vermonters, even those who do not have children. My son is already a junior in college, and neither of us would be where we are today without having had access to affordable, quality child care.I taught in day and boarding schools for 18 years, working within 24/7 schedules. I often had to be at school very early and tended to students in the dorm until fairly late at night, all while attending graduate school and teaching privately on the weekends. Access to quality child care and a trusted professional educator who cared for and loved my son allowed me to focus on taking care of my family and my career. Miss Barbara, who ran a child care program in her home, had a background in early childhood education and used several different curricula to teach the children in her program. My son loved going to Miss Barbara’s — he enjoyed playing and learning with the other children, the guided walks outside, and her delicious homemade food! Meanwhile, with Ms. Barbara’s care and teachings, his language and communication improved vastly, as did his social skills and physical development.Early childhood educators (ECEs) are professionals with specialized knowledge and training. The only way to bolster a diverse, well-prepared, and well-supported ECE workforce is with professional compensation and respect for the essential work they do to help care for and educate our children. And there are many Vermont families with young children who would and could benefit from more robust child care options. Access to affordable and professional child care empowers parents to participate in the economy. It allows them to be fully present in their workplaces. And, when we are less worried and anxious about where our children will be during the day, we have more time to dream, to create businesses that contribute to the economy and livelihood of our state. Our children experience the benefits of having parents and caregivers who have the time and freedom to work. When we invest in common-sense solutions that support families and our economy, we keep people and businesses in our Green Mountain State. Public investment in child care does just that.The 2025 legislative session has big implications for child care. As lawmakers in Montpelier make critical state funding decisions, they need to hear from us that child care is an absolute priority for Vermonters. Our state representatives and senators have an opportunity to build on a solution that’s working. Doing so would increase access and lower costs for child care while supporting our workforce and preparing our youngest children for school.I love our state. I love that my job lets me experience so much of it and share it with others. Neither my son nor I would be where we are today without the luck we had in accessing quality early education. So, let’s build a Vermont where it’s not just about luck but, instead, about our values and creating a community where we can all thrive — and that all starts with access to quality, affordable child care.

Twelve states are suing President Donald Trump and officials in his administration over tariffs that have touched nearly all goods imported into the United States.
The suit, State of Oregon, et al., v. Trump, et al., was filed last week by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 11 other Democratic state attorneys general in the Court of International Trade in New York. It names Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and its leader, Peter Flores.
The attorneys general — from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont — are challenging four of Trump’s executive orders that have added a 145% tariff on most imports from China, a 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on most all other goods imported to the U.S. The suit also preemptively challenges Trump’s plan to raise tariffs on imports from more than 40 other countries on July 9, according to a news release from the Oregon Attorney General’s Office.
“​​We cannot sit quietly while the president takes actions that are going to cost us jobs, increase the prices that we pay, and harm our economy,” Rayfield told reporters Wednesday at a news conference held at the Oregon Department of Justice in Portland.
Experts estimate tariffs could raise the cost of living for the average family nationwide by more than $3,800 a year, according to a report from the Budget Lab at Yale University.
Rayfield and the other attorneys general argue Trump is unlawfully using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs that are, under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, powers granted only to Congress, not the executive branch. The 1977 Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president broad latitude on financial regulation and foreign policy if a national emergency, described as an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” is declared.
The attorneys general argue no such threat exists, and that no president before Trump has imposed tariffs based on the Emergency Economic Powers Act.
“Congress has the sole authority to set tariff policy,” Rayfield said. “Congress has enacted various laws that allow the president to implement tariffs under certain conditions, but most importantly, certain safeguards. And it’s these conditions and safeguards that the president doesn’t like.”
Employment fears
Rayfield was joined by state Rep. Daniel Nguyễn, D-Lake Oswego, and co-founder of Portland-based Bambuza Vietnam Kitchen; Pat Hubbell, owner of Brooklyn Pharmacy in Portland; Graham Trainor, president of Oregon AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 300,000 unionized Oregonians working in construction, education, health care and manufacturing; Todd Nelson, co-owner of Bountiful Farms in Woodburn; Cody Sullivan, the first person with Down syndrome to graduate with a four-year degree from an Oregon college, and Ann Donaca, Sullivan’s aide and a retired educator.
Nguyễn said Bambuza, like all businesses, is struggling to deal with the economic insecurity wrought by the tariffs. He said the business has stocked many of its Vietnamese imports, such as rice paper, rice noodles and coffee, but he knows they will not last long.
“This survival mentality might save an individual business in a pinch, but it can’t be sustained, and it can be devastating for our broader economy,” he said.
Trainor said Trump’s erratic use of tariffs lacks a clear strategy, making them detrimental rather than beneficial for workers. He said many union members are “wondering if their jobs will still exist tomorrow.”
“What we need is a comprehensive trade policy that puts workers first,” he said. “That means targeting unfair trade practices, investing in domestic industries and ensuring that tariffs are used strategically, not just as political weapons.”
Sullivan has been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for three years. Donaca said that’s only going to get harder in an economy where hiring slows altogether due to economic uncertainty.
Feeling the pain
Both Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek and Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, held roundtables recently with small- and medium- business owners to discuss the impact of tariffs.
Business leaders told Kotek April 16 they were frustrated at the speed and inconsistency with which tariffs are being issued, and some said their businesses might not survive if tariffs continue for much longer.
“We believe manufacturers our size are going to go under,” Emma Mcilroy, CEO of Portland-based clothing company Wildfang, told Kotek.
Oregon’s state economist, Carl Riccadonna, joined Kotek’s roundtable discussion. He has encouraged business owners to take a survey from Business Oregon, the state’s economic development agency, so it can gather more information about tariff impacts.
Riccadonna said the full impact of tariffs on Oregon’s economy — measured by growth of new or existing businesses, increases in hiring and decreases in inflation — likely won’t be known until mid-summer.
At a roundtable with businesses held at the Port of Portland Monday, Wyden said he and Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican, would introduce legislation to end Trump’s tariffs as early as this week.
Wyden described it as “one of the most important matters I’ve ever been involved with in my entire life.”
“I think the stakes are that high,” he said.

He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.
Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.



It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro



Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.

One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”
Bias and language barriers 
Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.

“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”
‘Ripple effect’ 
Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”

Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

On Thursday, April 17, a 20-year-old boy, a student, walked around FSU’s sunny campus, firing a handgun. Two dead; six injured.
The response from our elected leaders? The usual: “Thoughts and prayers.”
The governor of the State of Florida said he was “praying,” adding, “We are all Seminoles today.”
First Lady Casey DeSantis: “Praying.”
Sen. Rick Scott: Also “praying.”
The president of the United States called the attack “terrible, a shame,” then blew off any suggestion of gun control reform, saying he’s a “big advocate of the Second Amendment.”
Maybe he missed the praying memo.
I teach at FSU; and that Thursday afternoon, I was locked down in my office.
It was frightening, yes; it was also horribly familiar. This is America: Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine, Uvalde, Nashville, Parkland.
The Tallahassee Democrat reported that several survivors of the 2018 Marjorie Stoneman Douglas shooting were on campus that day.
Robbie Alhadeff’s sister Alyssa died at MSD: “Something has to change,” he said.
Graduate student Stephanie Horowitz saw people running and knew instantly what was happening.
Jason Leavy was a freshman at MSD when Nikolas Cruz murdered 17 people. He knew, too, and started barricading his classroom door.
 “It’s the least surprising thing in the world, honestly,” he said.
Every one of those kids has been through multiple active shooter drills. Many faculty have, too.
We are supposed to shove desks against our doors, turn off the lights, “harden” our schools and churches and college campuses and act as though we’re grateful when politicians express their insincere and frankly insulting “sympathy.”
Nobody wants their feeble prayers and, as for their thoughts, if the violence-loving reactionaries in charge of this state were actually capable of thoughts they’d realize things do not have to be this way.
 Priorities
From the state Capitol to the U.S. Capitol, politicians shrug: Guns matter more than people; children, high school students, college students — they don’t give the big money to political campaigns.
The Second Amendment trumps all the others.
We’re supposed to accept there’s nothing anyone can do: This is just the way things are.
As The Onion’s evergreen mass shooting headline goes, “‘No Way to Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.”
But the kids ain’t all right; the kids are scared — and furious.
  Florida State University students marched to the Capitol on April 23, 2025, less than a week after a gunman opened fire on their campus, calling for legislation on guns and school safety. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)
Last Tuesday, a group of FSU students braved the morally noxious fumes of the Capitol to demand sensible gun control, red flag laws, firearm storage legislation — commonsense stuff like that.
Madalyn Probst, president of the FSU College Democrats, said, “The fact that they are able to sit in this place and prioritize weapons over my life, my friends’ lives, and the lives of my community around me is deplorable.”
Problem is, the grown folks in charge don’t care.










“The fact that they are able to sit in this place and prioritize weapons over my life, my friends’ lives, and the lives of my community around me is deplorable.”


– Madalyn Probst, FSU College Democrats


The Florida House has approved a bill allowing 18-year-olds to buy guns, repealing a law they passed after the murders at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School.
We don’t let them drink, but hell, they can get themselves a nice Taurus 9mm semi-automatic handgun — just like the one used to kill three and wound five at Michigan State University in 2023.
Here at FSU, you can still see the mountains of flowers and teddy bears where the wounded and dead fell. Yet the governor — who has the emotional intelligence of a poison dart frog —continues to push what he calls “Second Amendment Summer.”
If you’re buying a gun or ammo between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, you don’t have to pay sales tax.
Because we want more people packing heat.
‘Protecting’ children
The FSU atrocity was Florida’s sixth mass shooting and the 27th school shooting in the nation.
This year. So far.
The grown folks in charge are obsessed with “protecting” children from fluoride and potentially life-saving vaccines.
No letting them near books like “And Tango Makes Three,” lest they want to become gay.
No letting them discover trans people and queer people are real and deserving of dignity.
They can’t stand the thought of high schoolers reading Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” or “The 1619 Project,” lest they learn about the horrors of slavery.
They are terrified college students might study sociology, delve into political theories suggesting organizational models for the state that don’t insist our version of rapacious capitalism is the best, or encounter books that challenge religious or cultural orthodoxies.
As for sex, they don’t even want to think about it — unless, of course, the teenaged daughter gets pregnant or the teenaged son gets an STD.
They insist on shielding kids from a slew of normal human realities, but not gun violence.
It’s OK for young people to grow up knowing how to barricade themselves inside a classroom or learn strategies for evading a mass shooter but not appreciate poetry or play a musical instrument or master a foreign language.
It’s OK for them to live scared of that loner kid or that angry-looking guy or some person they can’t see, someone who wants to spill as much blood as possible.
The freedom to get a gun any time for any reason is more important.
So, we have Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine, Uvalde, Nashville, Parkland, and now FSU.
United Against Hate
One of my students reminded me there was supposed to be a “United Against Hate” symposium in honor of Maura Binkley on April 17.
Maura Binkley was the student shot and killed at a yoga studio in 2018 along with another woman.
The symposium was to promote campus safety, but it had to be canceled.
The FSU building where it should have taken place was a crime scene.
Maura Binkley was murdered by a guy who hated women.
The young man who allegedly walked around campus shooting his classmates hates people of color — he’s a Trump supporter and a white supremacist.
He told a fellow student Black people were ruining his neighborhood.
The United States government manufactures hatred against anyone who’s not a white Christian, embracing violence against its citizens.
Nowhere is safe.

These facilities are dangerous for the people […],"Photo by Alex Potemkin/Getty Images.Minnesota taxpayers entrust our government with billions of dollars each year to make Minnesota a safe and dignified place to live — including for people in prison. It’s hard to believe we might throw away hundreds of millions of dollars trying to salvage 100-year-old prisons in deep disrepair. These facilities are dangerous for the people living and working inside. The only safe and affordable option is to close them once and for all.
In February 2025, the Minnesota Office of the Ombuds for Corrections released an urgent update to its 2024 report on the state of Minnesota correctional facilities. Both reports paint a dire picture for two of the state’s prisons in Stillwater and St. Cloud, which together house around 2,300 individuals: these prisons are crumbling.
Moreover, as these prisons continue to deteriorate, our state’s prison population is growing. According to a recent report by the Crime and Justice Institute — a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that partners with jurisdictions nationwide to improve justice systems — Minnesota’s prison population has been rising faster than in other states since the pandemic. From 2021 to 2022, our incarceration rate grew by 8% compared to just 2% nationally, for instance. 
The human cost of the increasingly crowded prisons and their disrepair is devastating. In an op-ed last year, Maurice L. Ward—CEO of Justice Impacted Individuals Voting Effectively — described his experience in the Stillwater prison as “living in a coffin but not buried underground,” where the temperature inside felt like “120 degrees.” Folks inside have been moved to create powerful art, tell important stories and stage peaceful demonstrations to illustrate the inhumanity of such conditions. This alone should be enough to reconsider the future of these facilities.
But it gets worse. The old-fashioned layout of these facilities — with stacked cells — reduces corrections officers’ line of sight, creating additional safety risks in an already dangerous environment where lockdowns can, and do, emerge at a moment’s notice. 
Additionally, the financial cost of facility maintenance is massive: The Department of Corrections estimates operating the correctional facilities in both Stillwater and St. Cloud costs almost $100 million, while the cost of urgent repairs at just St. Cloud is an estimated $71 million. We’re talking about nearly $200 million just for business as usual, which still leaves the people living and working in these facilities in danger. 
Once you factor in the amount of work required to address the long-term infrastructure issues, this price tag skyrockets. Standing water, falling bricks, leaky roofs, plumbing problems, and excessive heat during the warmer months make living and working at these prisons inhumane. A 2014 study to replace the St. Cloud facility projected a cost that amounts to an estimated $730 million in today’s dollars. Should we spend this much to replace just one of these crumbling prisons? The DOC itself calls this “the epitome of throwing good money after bad.”
Minnesota lawmakers know the importance of an individual’s successful reentry after incarceration, as evidenced by the passage of recent laws that incentivize participation in prison programming for those in custody, like substance abuse disorder treatment, medical and mental health services, and vocational, career and education training. This programming is impossible in crumbling facilities lacking usable spaces.
We understand that breaking the law and causing significant harm to people, property and society requires accountability. We ask Minnesotans to imagine what accountability mechanisms will be possible if we invest in the human potential of those who live and work inside these facilities. 
As statewide decision-makers consider long-term solutions, the economic and human costs of addressing the issues in Stillwater and St. Cloud mount daily. We can spend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to fix or replace these unfixable prisons, or we can take that money and build a plan that keeps communities safe and uplifts the humanity of every resident. The Minnesota Justice Research Center joins the chorus of people urging the immediate decommissioning of these prisons. 
Do you have thoughts about the future of Minnesota’s crumbling prisons? Join us for a community conversation hosted by the MNJRC and We Are All Criminals at the Weisman Art Museum on May 8, 2025. 
We’ll view powerful pieces in the SEEN exhibit, hear from the Office of Ombuds for Corrections and CJI about their reports, discuss what we know, and work together to reimagine the future of these facilities — because we don’t have another option.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/barbed-wire.jpg,,,2025-04-28 07:05:32.612611

Ed Charbonneau talks to colleagues late Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Controversial language targeting homeless Hoosiers, regulating marijuana-like products and cracking down on illicit massage parlors perished late Thursday — even as Indiana lawmakers crammed changes to a new property tax reform package into an unrelated agency bill to end the session.
And despite big health care reform talk, few fixes survived a breakneck session marked by a dismal revenue forecast.
 Three things on our list that didn’t make the cut, and one that did

The time of death was 10:12 p.m.
That’s when House Speaker Todd Huston announced a package of technical corrections would be the last to make it through a critical procedural step.
Community advocates celebrated the defeat of shuffled-around language they maintained would have criminalized homelessness. Sleeping or sheltering on government property would’ve been a Class C misdemeanor.

One version would have required local law enforcement to consider emergency detention, offer transportation to temporary shelter and contact crisis intervention specialists before making an arrest — an attempt to connect homeless Hoosiers to help, supporters maintained.
But the original, long-dead bill only provided a legal defense: no nearby shelter. It was the work of the Cicero Institute, a Texas think tank pushing such policies around the country.
“In these times of economic volatility, the most vulnerable Hoosiers and the community organizations who serve them can sleep a little better knowing their elected officials chose not to force local law enforcement to fine and jail people just for not being able to afford a place to lay their heads,” Prosperity Indiana policy head Andrew Bradley wrote in an early Friday news release. His organization was among the proposal’s fiercest opponents. 
Some lawmakers joined in, too. 
“I worked hard to ensure this legislation never became law,” Sen. Ron Alting, R-Lafayette, said in an early Friday statement. “The solution to homelessness is not incarceration.”
The General Assembly also snuffed out a contentious set of regulations for marijuana-like products, after seven rounds of substantial edits failed to ease concerns.
Products with legally low concentrations of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol have proliferated in Indiana, alongside those containing delta-8 THC and other isomers. Although lawmakers have repeatedly failed to regulate the nascent industry, they seemed poised to do so this session through Senate Bill 478.

But it never emerged from closed-door negotiations over a final version. Critics, including Indiana’s attorney general and anti-marijuana groups, maintained the language would expand existing loopholes instead of closing them.
“I just think we couldn’t get to a place of agreement, you know?” Huston told reporters early Friday. “… I just don’t think we were ready yet.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said it was “tricky” to “get it absolutely right,” adding, “We just wanted to be certain that we didn’t move forward in a way that wasn’t in the state’s best interest.”
Lawmakers had hoped to “get some small piece of that across the line,” like a 21-plus age restriction, he told reporters, but “ran out of time.” He cited young children who may rely on cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive anticonvulsant, to treat seizures.
“We’ll come back, I can promise you, next year, and get something passed,” Bray said.
And one legislator’s attempt to fight human trafficking in massage parlors — following arrests in his district — was stripped out of an awareness measure.
Rep. Wendy McNamara, repeatedly dubbed the detailed regulations appended to House Enrolled Act 1416 overly “prescriptive” before cutting them. McNamara, R-Evansville, is an influential force in criminal matters and was among the co-authors.
  Sen. Mike Bohacek speaks with a colleague while the Senate is in session on Wednesday, April 23, 2025. He spent several days attempting to re-home language about massage parlors.(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, vowed to find another place for it in comments to the Indiana Capital Chronicle. But he admitted defeat — for now.
“This is something I’m going to continue to work on through the summer and into the next session, so we get some good language around this,” Bohacek said on the Senate floor. “The practices that are happening there (in massage parlors) is something we need to address for human trafficking in the future.”
One concept that did cross the finish line? A ban of mysterious origin on government-supported “obscene performances.” And “any person” could seek injunctive relief.
Indiana already has detailed obscenity laws on the books, and no one gave any examples of problematic performances being paid for by government. 
It was first spliced into legislation cracking down on child sex abuse materials, with the lawsuit provision inserted on the House floor. Then, as the end of session loomed, it was wedged into House Enrolled Act 1014, which previously focused on misdemeanors.
“Your shoulders have to be really aching from all the water that you’re carrying on this bill,” Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, told sponsor Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange.
He and other opponents feared the language would have little practical effect, instead “chilling” activities some simply may “disagree with” and putting local governments at legal risk.
 Trailer language walks back pieces of property tax legislation

Republicans also made eleventh-hour changes to a Department of Local Government and Finance (DLGF) measure, baking in trailer language to a contentious property tax bill that passed — and was signed into law — a week prior.
The final version of House Enrolled Act 1427 approved by the House and Senate in the last hours of the session deletes an increase in the business personal property tax exemption for 2025 that was previously approved in Senate Enrolled Act 1. Instead of jumping to $1 million in 2025, the exemption will remain at the $80,000 in current law and rise to $2,000,000 starting with the 2026 assessment date and beyond.
“One of my biggest concerns with our initiatives this year was the movement with business personal property tax, and I know that the $2 million exemption is for the 2026 assessment,” said Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, hours before the end of session. He discussed the trailer language, briefly, in the House Rules Committee.
“What I’m hoping for, as we get closer to that point in time, is we’re going to take a real hard look and get some local runs to see what that looks like for our local communities,” he continued. “My district is very heavily reliant on business personal property. This is kicked down the road a little bit, so we can’t really see a lot of trouble in the runs now. But going forward, as we get closer … I would hope that we would be able to talk about what those runs look like as we narrow in on that time.”
Indiana Senate sends finalized local property, income tax plan to governor

The property tax legislation already sign by the governor also created an exception to allow certain new depreciable personal property placed in service after Jan. 1 to avoid the 30% minimum depreciation floor. The trailer bill walked that language back “if property tax revenue that is attributable to the depreciable personal property is pledged as payment for bonds ,leases, or other obligations.”
Under House Enrolled Act 1427, the agricultural base rate in Senate Enrolled Act 1 additionally will not apply for the January 2025 assessment date for land that is considered “inventory.”
Another part of the legislation deals with disabled veterans. Although Senate Enrolled Act 1 repealed traditional property tax deductions for veterans and replaced them with local credits, trailer language repeals those new local credits and reinstates the traditional veteran deductions that existed previously.
Huston maintained early Friday that post-passage changes to Senate Enrolled Act 1 weren’t the result of a rushed legislative process on property tax reforms.
“One of the reasons we wanted to move (Senate Enrolled Act 1) was to continue to get that feedback — and we’re glad we got the feedback around the business personal property tax. We still have the long-term vision of it. We just want to make sure in those areas where it’s being bonded against, those bonds are protected,” he said. “And then on the veterans credit, I think there’s a little miscommunication with what the policy is, and with the veterans organizations. We want to make sure we’re listening to their concerns and adjust to it, and we’ll have that conversation again next year. I imagine it was probably not the last time we’ll talk about that topic.”
But Senate Democrat leader Sen. Shelli Yoder, of Bloomington, said additions in House Enrolled Act 1427 were needed, in part, because lawmakers moved too quickly before the state’s April budget forecast was released.
“The Senate Democrat caucus has been saying to slow down. Let’s make sure we get this right. Let’s not get to a place, especially when we’ve had real concerns. But when we got that budget forecast — and all of a sudden, we’re having to do some serious back-stepping — no, this was no surprise,” she said.
“What we did quickly see is sort of wide-eyed like, ‘Oh gosh, what did we do? How are we going to fix this, and maybe slow down the rollout?'” Yoder added, referring to Senate Enrolled Act 1. “But again, no matter you know how you spin it, it was kind of a bait and switch. It was a shell game for Hoosiers. You know, here’s property tax relief that never really came as relief.”
 What about health care?

After years of targeting Indiana’s health care prices, Indiana lawmakers started the session by introducing several comprehensive reforms — but where did they end?
Many new laws will follow in the footsteps of their predecessors by requiring more reporting and transparency. Whether it’s the 340B drug program, the average cost of hospital services or disclosing ownership ties, health care providers across the spectrum will have more paperwork in their future. 
One of the biggest packages was reversed after the initial effort was criticized for setting “price caps” on five nonprofit hospital systems. Violators would lose their tax-exempt status with the state. 
Now, such a move wouldn’t occur until 2029 at the earliest, following a state-sponsored study to determine average prices. Numerous studies have already done such analysis only to be dismissed for being slanted to one side of the debate or another. Authors hope that having a state agency perform the calculations will bring clarity. 
 
A long-sought tax: 
For years, health care advocates have sought an increase to the state’s cigarette tax, notching a win this session after a grim financial forecast. Cigarettes will now be $2 more expensive, with proportional increases for other forms of tobacco. 
“We have to have a healthier Indiana. We have to have people that are healthier,” said House Speaker Todd Huston about the tax increase. “This is something that I think will have long, long-term impacts for helping people make positive choices.”


One particular disappointment for health advocates was the decision to slash funding for local public health departments from $100 million annually to $40 million. 
“Indiana has had abysmal health care rankings over the years … that was the whole idea of finally putting some money behind doing something,” said House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta. “ Now just to basically take the rug out is, I think, just not the way to go.”
But Bray rejected the notion that such a cut undid that previous work. 
“Absolutely, unequivocally, no,” he said. “If you look across the counties of the state, there was about 45% of those funds that went unspent. Not because they weren’t using it correctly or anything, but because they were … rolling out program and trying to develop them.
“Everybody’s left this budget wanting a little bit more,” he continued. “But this still continues to fund public health projects. And it is our hope that in a couple years, we’ll be able to fund that at a stronger level.”
Another big strike to the state’s overall health: curbing enrollment on Indiana’s Medicaid expansion program. The Healthy Indiana Plan serves low- to moderate-income Hoosiers and, like similar programs across the country, has increased access to preventative care services and decreased emergency department visits — though such progress could be derailed if a significant number of Hoosiers lose their health care coverage. 
Gov. Mike Braun indicated his support for many of the measures above, naming health care as one of his core targets ahead of the 2025 session.  But he said that there was more work to be done.
“I think we got a good start on it,” Braun told reporters on Thursday. “I think health care will be a big agenda item for next year.”

(Getty Images)April is National Reentry Month — a time to reflect on what it truly takes for someone to come home, rebuild their life, and thrive. Much attention has been given to immediate needs like employment and housing. But even beyond these basic services, the road to reintegration demands something deeper: attention to mental health and the space for personal healing.
I grew up in Louisiana, where digging in the dumpster for food wasn’t just a phrase — it was my reality. Watching my mother work miracles with what little we had shaped my worldview. From those beginnings through military service, a PhD at NYU, and medical school at Tulane, I’ve learned a powerful truth: transformation begins when opportunity meets mental resilience.
Now, as a Triple Board Resident specializing in Pediatrics, General Psychiatry, and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry — and as the leader of the Inner Words: Empowering Justice-Involved Individuals Through Identity-Based Mental Health Therapeutic Conversations program — I see daily how mental health support can rewrite futures. From juvenile detention centers to adult facilities across Indiana, we’re witnessing something powerful: when people are given the tools to understand their emotions and build resilience, they begin to reclaim control over their lives.
The evidence of transformation is clear. During our five-week program, we’ve seen individuals — some facing serious charges — develop emotional regulation skills and new perspectives on conflict resolution.
FSSA launches pilot mental health program in jails

One young girl, once quick to fight when tensions rose, had a moment of clarity. She said, “I used to fight other people because I had an issue with someone, but now I’m thinking, why do I do that? There’s no need for me to fight anyone anymore.” Her words are a testament to a simple truth: when young people are taught to pause and reflect, they discover new paths forward.
This transformation isn’t accidental. It results from creating psychological safety, encouraging deeper reflection, and establishing community guidelines—ones that include the grace to mess up, the introspection to apologize, and the respect to hear each other out. We teach that emotions like anger are normal. What matters is how we choose to respond.
Justice-involved individuals are no different from others in their potential, but the difference in their lived experiences is often stark. Many come from environments lacking access to healthy food, quality education, and safe spaces. The path to reducing recidivism must address these root causes while also building mental resilience.
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s Road to Reentry program has stepped forward to support this vital work. Their investment allows us to expand Inner Words Empower to three adult correctional facilities in Indiana — Heritage Trail, Pendleton, and Plainfield — while continuing year-round sessions at the Public Advocates in Community re-Entry (PACE) Center.
Anthem also partners with organizations like Thomas Ridley’s 1 Like Me, which helps remove practical barriers to reentry, such as driver’s license reinstatement. Their Hope Hustler Outreach Program has helped more than 2,000 individuals regain their licenses removing this significant barrier to employment and independence.
These partnerships and investments recognize that successful reentry requires a comprehensive approach—meeting practical needs while nurturing mental health and personal development. This hope isn’t naive optimism—it’s grounded in evidence that trauma-informed, cognitively focused interventions work. By combining support services with emotional resilience building, we’re creating a framework for lasting change.

A few weeks after the birth, the two were temporarily separated. Hailey poses for a portrait after being temporarily reunited with her daughter on April 1 in Cuba. Asked what she misses most, Hailey replied: “Her smiling” (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).CUBA, Mo. — Hailey cradled her cat like a baby and nuzzled his fur. It wasn’t long before he rejected the attention and leapt from her arms in the callous way cats do. She cursed him in the way hormonal teenagers do.
Ash, a gray stray Hailey took in against her great-aunt’s protesting, became the teen’s comfort through a pregnancy and postpartum that spanned 10 foster homes, hospitals and group homes across Missouri. 
Hailey entered the state foster system at 2 years old. She’s lost count of how many roofs she’s slept under. 
Last spring at 15 years old, Hailey learned she was pregnant.
When she asked the state for an abortion, Hailey was told the possibility wasn’t up for discussion. By the time her stomach started to bulge, Missourians voted to codify the right to abortion in the state Constitution, and Hailey decided she wanted to parent. 
But it wasn’t so simple. 
By then, Hailey was staying with her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, but the state remained her legal guardian. Though Hailey took initiative to prepare for motherhood, caseworkers on several occasions during her pregnancy threatened to take the baby after she was born, rolling out examples from Hailey’s long history in the state’s care.
In late February, just a few weeks after Hailey turned 16, her daughter was born. The resemblance is unmistakable: vibrant red locks, pale skin and blue eyes. 
From the moment her baby girl entered the world, Hailey feared the state would take her. While that hasn’t happened permanently, the state did temporarily separate the young mother and child, moving them to different cities in different corners of the state. 
By eight weeks postpartum, Hailey had slept in two hospitals and four homes. 
Desperate to reunite her child with family as she was shuffled around the foster system, Hailey signed power of attorney of her daughter over to Spradley, to whom she also wanted to return.
In early April, after months of protesting the state’s push to move her into a faith-based maternity home, Hailey acquiesced. It allowed her to reunite with her daughter. 
A few weeks later, on the eve of a court hearing to discuss her permanent placement, Hailey ran away from the maternity home with her 6-week-old in her arms. Both were quickly found and returned to state custody. 
Hailey said she fled, in part, out of fear the state would officially declare she couldn’t live with Spradley. And she was terrified about where they might send her next. 
The family’s fate remains uncertain.










As a teen in such a vulnerable situation, she deserved to be held and surrounded by care, and instead, she was placed in this really precarious, uncertain situation.


– Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You


Missouri has long been one of the most anti-abortion states in the country, with elected officials and advocates preaching the virtue of supporting young mothers to ensure abortion isn’t their only option. 
But Hailey said this sentiment is a far cry from her experience. To her, it felt like the state first made the decision to continue the pregnancy for her, then actively worked to keep her from parenting her child. 
The Independent spent months following Hailey and reviewing communications between her, Spradley, their advocates and the state that spanned Hailey’s pregnancy and postpartum. 
The record of her struggles in the system illustrate what youth advocates and foster care experts say are repeated failures by the state to support Hailey, and later her daughter. 
“Hailey was saying she wanted to parent, so she should have been supported,” said Laura Sullivan, a licensed independent social worker in Ohio who has spent several months advocating for Hailey. “In these states where they’re forcing pregnancies, especially teen pregnancies, they have to be ready to help these moms to parent.”
A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services, which oversees the state foster care system, said she could not discuss the specifics of Hailey’s case, instead pointing to Missouri’s Child Welfare Manual.
 ‘Don’t get pregnant’

The Facebook message came from a stranger. 
“I have a child on my caseload who I believe is a relative to you,” an employee with a Missouri foster care agency wrote the morning of May 21, 2024. 
Within hours, the state cleared and authorized Spradley to take her niece in under a temporary arrangement. Hailey was on her doorstep by that evening.
A letter dated that same day stated that while Hailey remained in the custody of Children’s Division, she was being placed with Spradley for an “indeterminate period.” 
Though filled with gaps, the aunt and niece have a long history. Spradley used to take Hailey to the St. Louis Zoo, propping her up against the wooden railings to catch a glimpse of the animals. As Hailey got older, Spradley would take her driving around different corners of southeast Missouri to get ice cream or go to a park. 
At times they went years without seeing one another. Though another great-aunt of Hailey’s — Spradley’s sister — adopted Hailey when she was 4, Hailey spent much of her childhood shuffled between different foster homes and mental hospitals. 
 Hailey doesn’t remember her mother well, but she holds on to photos of them together in the first few years of Hailey’s life, before her mother died when she was 4 years old (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
She was a flight risk almost everywhere she went until she landed at Spradley’s.
“Don’t get pregnant,” Hailey recalled Spradley telling her when she moved in. 
A few weeks later, Hailey went to the doctor to confirm what she feared. Hailey, who only a few months earlier had turned 15, was pregnant. 
She wanted an abortion in the beginning. When Hailey asked her case worker if it was possible, she was told the state wasn’t allowed to discuss it with her. Abortion at the time remained illegal in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies.
Hailey couldn’t get up the nerve to tell Spradley she was pregnant, so she made a friend break the news instead. But Spradley didn’t kick her out. She doubled down on her desire to help.
Spradley searched the internet for answers. She sent a note to JustChoice — an agency based out of Ohio that helps people create abortion, adoption or parenting plans — saying her niece had been denied an abortion and now wanted to raise her child.
There was just one problem, Spradley said: Though months from her due date, the state was already threatening to take away Hailey’s baby. 
 ‘We’re going to remove that baby’

Sullivan, the licensed independent social worker at JustChoice, reached out to Spradley after her organization received her message in late 2024. With Spradley’s permission, she started communicating with Hailey’s case worker to talk about a parenting plan.
Sullivan recalls the case worker in their initial calls telling her: “I don’t think Hailey’s going to be able to parent. We’re going to remove that baby. Her and her aunt, this is not a stable situation; they have a long history with the agency.’” 
Most urgent, the case worker told Sullivan, was Spradley’s lack of adequate housing. If she wanted to maintain custody of Hailey through her pregnancy, she needed somewhere else to live. 
After staying with a friend in St. Louis, Spradley and Hailey moved into the home and church of a former pastor in Wright City. Some of Spradley’s friends had pointed them to the old building off a rural highway as emergency accommodations.
The house, which abutted woods and farmland, sat untouched after the pastor died months earlier.
In the main room, religious relics crowded the wall. Behind one closed door was what Hailey dubbed the “porn room,” after they found explicit images on an abandoned computer. Hailey slept upstairs beneath old posters of semi trucks plastered to the walls. 
The lack of heat became a growing concern as winter approached.

The state began talking of removing Hailey from Spradley’s care; a faith-based maternity home in the St. Louis suburbs that contracts with the state was suggested. Hailey remained adamant she didn’t want to go. When her case worker recommended she have bags packed and by the door the week of Christmas, she listened. 
But she also shut down, growing moodier as the looming threat of removal hung over the holidays.
The new year came and went. Hailey’s bags remained by the door. The state never stopped by.
Sullivan, searching for a solution, teamed up with Right By You, an “all options” nonprofit focused on helping pregnant youth, to raise money for Spradley to rent an upgraded apartment.
Within weeks, Right By You raised $5,000 — primarily through Missouri donors and abortion funds — to cover Spradley’s rent through May. Meanwhile, Sullivan worked the phones with Spradley, calling landlords in an attempt to find someone who would accept a pregnant teen, a 52-year-old on disability, two dogs and one cat.
She found a solution in Cuba, a town about 80 miles southwest of St. Louis. 
By mid-January, Hailey and Spradley were moved into a small, unadorned two-bedroom apartment.
Spradley reached out to her network of friends, asking if they could help furnish the apartment with baby essentials as a birthday surprise for Hailey, who turned 16 in late January. 
They came by the truck-load, dropping off strollers, onesies and a swing. Spradley used some of the disability back-pay she received to splurge on a crib and a bottle sanitizer.
In the end, it still wasn’t enough. 
 ‘Where are you going to live?’

Spradley didn’t take Hailey in sooner for many reasons. Poverty and poor health were the most prevailing. 
“So what’s your plan for where you are going to live?” Hailey’s case worker asked in a text to Spradley months earlier, shortly after Hailey learned she was pregnant. “Do you have any money saved?”
“I had absolutely no income when Hailey was brought to me,” Spradley replied. “Not a dime. I get SSI disability which is very little.” 
But once together, Hailey didn’t want to leave. Finally, someone understood her — a sarcastic and brash teen with a tendency to raise her voice.
“Some people would see what she’s doing and would freak out, but they don’t understand what she’s grown up and what she’s went through,” Spradley said. “That’s why I don’t judge her on that. That’s the big difference between me and other people.”
Unlike a foster parent, Spradley didn’t receive consistent financial benefits from the state for taking Hailey in. Though she attempted on several occasions to get certified as a foster parent through the state, she never received the final approval. 
Spradley suspects it’s because she’s poor and sick. 
She’s often seized by anxiety, which she said has only worsened since beginning to navigate the state’s hurdles in her attempts to help Hailey. She suffers from agoraphobia, Crohn’s disease, heart conditions and often uses a walker. 
Spradley attributed some of her ailments to growing up in Times Beach, Missouri. It’s now a ghost town, beset by a chemical contamination that came to light in the 1980s. The Environmental Protection Agency deemed it “one of the worst environmental disasters in our nation’s history.”
 Hailey holds up infant clothes to show her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, on Jan. 28, 2025, at their apartment in Cuba (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Hailey is as determined as her aunt. 
She enrolled in teen parenting classes through Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis as she started her second trimester. Between that and her prenatal appointments, she made weekly trips to St. Louis through her third trimester. 
Most weeks, she made the trip without Spradley, booking and boarding a van through MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid program. The vehicle usually picked up other patients along the way, stretching what was normally a 90-minute drive into multiple hours. 
The state on several occasions expressed concern with this arrangement, telling both Spradley and Sullivan that Hailey needed constant supervision. 
Instead, Spradley kept an eye on Hailey’s location from an app on her cell phone.
Every year, Missouri social services agencies seize millions of dollars in Social Security benefits from foster children. Hailey is among them. 
When Sullivan questioned how the state was using Hailey’s payments, which typically go toward funding foster care, she was told it was being used to pay for Medicaid expenses and the van rides.
She remains skeptical. That $400 a month could have gone a long way to help Spradley purchase furniture and buy groceries, both of which she said were held against her toward the end of Hailey’s pregnancy.
 Birth, ‘then I was out’

Days before Hailey went into labor, the state followed through on its threat. 
Hailey was removed from Spradley’s apartment in Cuba and sent to a private foster home near St. Louis. 
The foster mother, a stranger, drove her to the hospital. Once settled into a room, Hailey said the foster parent told her she was running down to the cafeteria.
Instead, she left Hailey at the hospital and never returned.
Hailey’s daughter was born two days later, on Feb. 26. The moment of joy was brief; within minutes, Hailey lost consciousness. 
“I had a whole asthma attack, then I ended up throwing up everything in my stomach, and then shaking so bad that my jaw was hurting,” she said. “Then I was out.” 
It took two blood transfusions to stem her postpartum hemorrhage.
Hailey ultimately stayed in the hospital for 12 days. Not because of her health, she said, but because the state didn’t know where else to send her.
This isn’t uncommon. In 2024, there were 314 Missouri foster children residing in hospitals. Others were held in hotels, offices and out-of-state residential treatment facilities. 
 Hailey carries her daughter into her great-aunt Jodi Spradley’s apartment on April 1 in Cuba during a day-long visit while Hailey was staying at a group home in southeast Missouri (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
While at the hospital, Hailey learned how to breastfeed. She believes her daughter shares her own lactose intolerance since she doesn’t take well to most formulas.
In many ways the two girls resemble Hailey’s mother, who was found dead in 2011, two years after Hailey had been removed from her custody. She was in the third trimester of pregnancy with a second daughter, who didn’t survive. The autopsy concluded a drug overdose. Spradley still believes it was something more nefarious.
A few months before Hailey gave birth, she asked Spradley if she could see the place where her mom died. They drove 60 miles to the apartment and asked the current tenant if they could look around. Hailey asked lots of questions. Spradley hoped it was healing.
She tries to tell Hailey stories of her mother often. Like the time Hailey’s mother, while pregnant with her, found a free mini fridge at a scrap sale and walked miles home with it. She later did the same with a kiddie pool.
Hailey doesn’t know her father. She hopes her daughter won’t, either.
The line for “father” on the birth certificate is blank, as Hailey intended. 
She says little about the 20-year-old other than that they first met at a foster home years earlier, that he beat her and that he was, for a time, homeless. 
Multiple warrants are out for his arrest, including for failure to appear in court on trespassing and theft charges.
Throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, one of Spradley’s closest friends, Brandie Coleman, was among her fiercest defenders. When Hailey gave birth, Coleman was by her side, Facetiming with Spradley, who feared the state might punish her for being there. 
As Hailey recovered from her hemorrhage, Coleman says a hospital social worker confided in her that a state case worker had been trying to convince her to report Hailey to child protective services so they could remove her baby. But Coleman says the hospital employee refused, not seeing any evidence of abuse or neglect. 
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, the Missouri-based reproductive rights group that helped fundraise for Hailey and Spradley, said the family’s self-advocacy was admirable. 
And in a way, she believes, they were punished for it.
She called Hailey’s case “such a blatant example of a pregnancy literally forced by the state, and then a very clear bias against this person and this notion that her child would be better off with a different family, and she was told that explicitly. And I just honestly was a little bit surprised how unveiled that was. There wasn’t really any pretense about it.” 
 Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, called Hailey a “forceful self advocate,” adding: “It’s really admirable for someone so young, who’s in such a disempowered situation” (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Kraft Sheley, who is also an attorney, said the fact that Hailey had a family member who wanted to take her in — who understood her — was huge. That Hailey was deprived of that support in the days leading up to and after her labor was “such inhumanity.”
“For any person to lose their home and be ripped away from their loved one within three days, four days of giving birth, one of the most formative, transformational experiences of a person’s life, she was treated with such a lack of care,” Kraft Sheley said. “… As a teen in such a vulnerable situation, she deserved to be held and surrounded by care, and instead, she was placed in this really precarious, uncertain situation.”
 Postpartum ‘disrupted’

When Hailey was finally discharged from the hospital, she and her baby were driven 200 miles southwest to Springfield. 
There, they were placed in a private foster home with other teen moms.
Less than a week later, Hailey called Spradley. She was being taken to a mental health hospital to be screened for postpartum depression. Hailey said she was told it was because the foster parent heard her yelling; Hailey said she was yelling at a friend on the phone, not at her baby.
“I never heard this kid cry like she did,” Spradley said of Hailey during the phone call. 
Her daughter was napping when they took Hailey away.
At the hospital, Hailey said she didn’t screen positive for postpartum depression but was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, meaning she has stronger emotional or behavioral responses to stress and trauma. 
Hailey said when she learned she was being admitted to the hospital without her daughter, she had to be sedated after she started “throwing hands” at staff. She remained there for six days. 
Spradley had little contact with Hailey in the hospital once her phone was taken away. When Hailey was released, she signed power of attorney for her daughter over to Spradley. 
As Spradley drove to pick up Hailey’s child, Hailey was taken to yet another location — this time a group home in southeast Missouri.
Hailey believes the separation from her daughter was intentional. Within the first month of her child’s life, the two had been apart nearly as much as they’d been together. 
She tried to continue pumping breast milk. At the start of her third trimester, Hailey had already started collecting small bottles of colostrum. But it didn’t take long after being separated from her daughter for her milk supply to diminish. 
 Hailey feeds her daughter while visiting her great-aunt Jodi Spradley on April 1 in Cuba (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
“For a teen mom, especially one with attachment issues like Hailey has, to be able to breastfeed successfully, that is beautiful and amazing, and could have been really healing,” Sullivan said. “But it was disrupted. So that caused both Hailey harm and (her daughter) harm.” 
Sullivan, who has also worked as a social worker in two states, said it’s easy to use a teen’s years-long history in the system against them unfairly. She doesn’t believe Missouri ever gave Hailey a fair chance. 
“Instead of being like, ‘This is a kid who we know has a lot of trauma and a lot of stuff, we should probably try to figure out how we’re going to help her parent and heal so she can be a good parent,’” Sullivan said. “‘It was just, ‘We’re on a mission to make her not be able to parent.’”
 ‘I’m not giving up on you’

On a sunny day in early April, Hailey returned to her aunt’s home in Cuba.
For the second time in a week, she held her daughter, who was one day shy of 5 weeks old.  
Hailey’s milk supply had mostly dried up. She considered attempting to breastfeed, but then opted to make a bottle instead. 
“Has she given you all the stink face yet?” Hailey asked as Spradley confirmed with a chuckle. 
“Good. That’s my child,” Hailey replied, smiling down at her daughter as she fed her.
She sat in her old room again, across from stickers adhered to the wall welcoming her baby home. She urged the dogs to be careful as they investigated her baby’s scent. She cuddled her cat.
It was all temporary.

Hailey was back for just part of the day on an authorized off-site visit. A few hours later, Spradley would drive her 90 minutes back to the group home where Hailey would again kiss her baby goodbye.
Until then, she changed diapers, went through paperwork and sorted baby clothes, a sense of normalcy in a life that had been anything but.
As Hailey lounged on the couch with her daughter and Spradley rocked her small dog, named Baby, in the corner, Spradley’s cell phone rang. At the sight of the caller ID, an old friend of Spradley’s, Hailey perked up and grabbed for the phone to say hello.  
“You know what? I love the sound of your voice right now. You sound so happy,” Spradley’s friend said to Hailey before pausing. “Honestly, are you doing OK?” 
“Not for good, sadly,” Hailey said. “Jodi kidnapped me for the day though.” 
She outlined her plan to return permanently to her daughter. The first step was the maternity home she initially resisted. It was her only option she saw to parent.
Less than a week later she checked into the St. Louis area facility. Spradley met her in the lobby with the baby. 
The past several months have been hard on Spradley. Anxiety attacks bare themselves in the middle of the night. She worries over Hailey and her daughter. She worries over herself. When she first took in Hailey, there were days she wondered if the stress was too much and if she should send Hailey away. But now, the house feels devastatingly empty without her. 
When Hailey was 11 weeks pregnant, she snuck Ash, the cat, into the house against Spradley’s wishes. At the time it infuriated Spradley, who was already having a difficult time feeding two humans and two dogs, making frequent trips to the food pantry. Then she saw how much comfort the cat brought Hailey as she faced an unknown future.
When Hailey was taken away, Spradley started letting the cat sleep beside her at night. 
Over the years, Hailey ran from multiple family members and foster homes.
But she never ran from Spradley. It’s something Hailey’s social worker pointed out to Spradley in messages throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, and something Spradley continues to emphasize in her fight to bring Hailey and her daughter back under her roof. 
 Jodi Spradley holds Hailey’s cat, Ash, on April 1 at her apartment in Cuba (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
It’s why Spradley wasn’t shocked when she learned at Hailey’s most recent placement hearing in mid-April that she had run away from the maternity home just hours earlier. 
“I don’t believe what the system is doing to her… She is a child that’s been in that system for so long that they broke her,” Spradley said the next day, after police located Hailey and her daughter about 130 miles east, in south-central Illinois.
“Sometimes she makes me so mad,” Spradley continued, “but I just can’t blame her for what they did to her. I blame them. I blame the system.”
After Hailey and her daughter were located by the state, they were moved to another foster home, just outside St. Louis. 
A few days later, Hailey said her case worker showed up with police, insisting her daughter was underweight and needed to be evaluated at the hospital. Spradley rushed to St. Louis Children’s Hospital to meet them. There, she said doctors gave the baby a clean bill of health and noted she gained weight since the week prior.
Then on Friday, hours after the Missouri Department of Social Services responded to a request for comment on Hailey’s case from The Independent, her case worker called Spradley. The state would soon allow Hailey and her daughter to return to Spradley’s care, at least until a court made a more permanent placement decision, Spradley said.
Despite the sudden good news, nothing about the family’s situation is set in stone.
“I’m scared about what tomorrow’s going to bring,” Spradley said Sunday.
She often reflects on words she spoke to Hailey’s mother not long before she died. Hailey was in a private foster home at the time. 
“I promise you I’m going to bring Hailey home,” she said more than a decade ago.
It’s why Spradley didn’t hesitate when Hailey reached out for help. Though when asked about that decision, Hailey, who doesn’t tend toward sentimentality, said, “I knew she’d take my dumb ass.”
She flipped Spradley the bird. Spradley mirrored the motion. 
“Me and Hailey, our relationship, even when she has hardships, I’m like, ‘I’m not letting you go,’” Spradley said. “I’m not giving up on you.”
It’s why Hailey chose Spradley to help raise her daughter. 
She’s adamant her daughter won’t end up in the state’s care the way she did. 
“What they’re doing is f**ked,” Hailey said of her lifetime spent in the foster system. 
Spradley is ready to fight right there alongside her niece. 
“We want her to experience an actual caring family and have support rather than toss you aside whenever they can’t handle you,” Spradley said. “If they can’t handle you at your worst, then they don’t deserve you at your best, right?”

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)A federal appeals court this week will finally hear the state’s appeal of a 2023 ruling that struck down a New Jersey law barring private companies from detaining immigrants.
Thursday’s hearing in front of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia comes as the Trump administration carries out its mass deportation plan and prepares to open what will be the east coast’s largest immigration detention center in Newark.
Since Trump took office for his second term in January, roughly 23,000 people have been deported, according to NBC News.
In 2021, Gov. Phil Murphy signed a law that barred public and private entities from entering contracts to house immigrant detainees. The move came after years of protests by immigrant advocates who called on Democratic leaders in Bergen, Essex, and Hudson counties to sever their contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which housed immigrant detainees in those counties’ jails.
CoreCivic filed a lawsuit challenging New Jersey’s law in February 2023. The company, which runs the Elizabeth Detention Center, which holds about 300 immigrant detainees, claimed the law unconstitutionally encroached on the federal government’s power. The Biden administration sided with CoreCivic, saying the law would be “catastrophic” to federal immigration efforts.
U.S. District Judge Robert Kirsch ruled partially against New Jersey, saying it can bar public entities from detaining immigrants but has no power to stop the federal government from entering contracts with private firms to house immigrant detainees. Attorneys for New Jersey appealed to the 3rd Circuit.
As the state waited for the federal panel to hear its appeal, President Donald Trump won reelection to the White House and began carrying out his mass deportation plan.
In February, private company Geo Group formally announced its plan to open a 1,000-bed immigrant detention jail in a Newark facility called Delaney Hall. The plans have faced opposition from immigrant advocates and some public officials (the city of Newark has gone to court in an attempt to halt or postpone its opening).
In March, the state Attorney General’s Office asked the 3rd Circuit to finally hear the state’s appeal, stressing that while the appeal is active, the state cannot enforce the 2021 law as it pertains to private companies. The hearing is scheduled for May 1 at 9:30 a.m.
Spokespeople for the Attorney General’s Office and for Geo Group and CoreCivic did not respond to requests for comment.

The legislature fought for years over proposals to expand eligibility for Medicaid, the public health program financed by states and the federal government. Expansion was the subject of some of the legislature’s loudest shouting matches in the years following the 2010 passage of the federal Affordable Care Act.
Missourians finally got tired of watching other states extend health insurance to low-income residents and boast of economic benefits and better health outcomes. They went to the ballot in 2020 and got the job done with a constitutional amendment.
Cue the recriminations. All over again. 
After years of gaining public acceptance, Medicaid funding is now endangered in the U.S. Congress, where Republicans are under pressure to find big pots of money to raid in order to pay for President Donald Trump’s tax cut package.
Federal Medicaid cuts could leave Missouri with huge budget shortfall

Medicaid is a huge pot of money. And Republicans are eyeing the portion that is used to compensate the 40 states that took advantage of an Obamacare provision to expand eligibility guidelines for low-income adults. 
The federal government currently pays 90% of the expansion costs. 
Should Congress claw back that money, states in total stand to lose about $600 billion over a decade’s time, according to a recent analysis. 
Cuts like that would force all states into difficult corners. But Missouri’s situation would be genuinely strange.
Because, after all of those years spent resisting Medicaid expansion, Missouri now is unable to get rid of it.
At least not easily.
With their bickering and inaction, legislators in Missouri forfeited the chance to enact Medicaid expansion by statute, which could be amended or even repealed if the occasion demanded. 
Instead, advocates expanded Medicaid eligibility by amending the state Constitution. Their work can only be undone by passing another amendment, which would be a long, acrimonious process.
And so, for the time being, Missouri would be forced to provide coverage to working-age, low-income adults, even if the federal match shrinks or disappears.
“So you will see cuts in other places,” said Bridgett McCandless, a retired physician who ran a health clinic for uninsured patients and served as CEO of the Health Forward Foundation, which focuses on expanding healthcare access.
“The three groups that are at the greatest risk are pregnant women, children and seniors with disabilities, primarily in nursing homes,” she said. “All that will have profound generational effects.”
Other cuts that wouldn’t violate the constitutional amendment could be reimbursement costs for providers, dental care, mental health and substance use treatment and home health care. Missouri may also be forced to look at cuts outside of its Medicaid program.
Somewhere out there, a class of term-limited Republican Missouri lawmakers nods sagely and says, “told you so.”
Indeed, certain legislators did warn that the state would be on the hook if a capricious future Congress reneged on its commitment to the Medicaid expansion match. It was the most solid argument against broadening the program — much less tedious than the insinuations that the low-income Missourians who stood to gain health insurance were freeloaders and grifters.
Then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat who wanted to expand Medicaid, proposed including a safety valve in state law: If federal funding was ever cut, Missouri would roll back the expansion. 
But no law was passed, and so no safety valve. We are left to argue about whether that is good or bad.
For now, the prevailing strategy seems to be to hope we don’t have to find out.  
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has turned heads by declaring that he won’t support outright cuts to Medicaid, though he does favor work requirements, which would force some people out of the program.
Hawley, a former Republican Missouri attorney general, has spent all of his political career opposing Obamacare, which includes Medicaid expansion.
What swayed him, he said, was the vote on the constitutional amendment, which was 53% in favor and 46% opposed. Many supporters found that a bit close for comfort, but in an interview with RollCall, a Washington outlet, Hawley called it “a big margin.” He also said he expected Trump to oppose cuts to Medicaid.
Whether that will happen, or whether Hawley will stick to his opposition, is anyone’s guess.
What’s certain is that about 1.3 million Missourians use Medicaid or the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program. That’s about one-fifth of the state’s population. 
Of that number, about 300,000 adults have gained access to health insurance since voter-mandated expansion took effect in 2021. Medicaid has enabled them to get annual checkups, be treated for chronic conditions and undergo long-delayed surgical procedures like joint replacements.
“Once you’re on it, it works beautifully,” McCandless said.
This is the outcome that opponents most feared in the long, bitter expansion debate — that once passed, Medicaid expansion would be impossible to get rid of. 
Turns out, they may be right. Even an act of Congress may not be enough to shut it down.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_mocapitol1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-28 07:05:32.612611

(Ron Cogswell | used by permission of the photographer)With the 100th day of President Donald Trump’s second term in office approaching, University of Wisconsin-Madison professors and staff met Thursday to take stock of the growing threats to higher education and U.S. democracy and to discuss collective action to push back. 
UW-Madison professor Mark Copelevitch said the threats to higher education are “unprecedented because it’s happening in America” yet compared the current moment to a movie that historians and experts have seen “over and over again.” 
  Mark Copelovitch
Copelovitch described the current U.S. system of government as competitive authoritarianism. He said comparisons for what is happening today don’t have to go back to 1930s Germany — recent examples are  Viktor Orban in Hungary and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey. 
“Universities are centers of independent ideas and dissent. Professors are attacked by populist and nationalist leaders as being the radical elite,” Copelovitch said.
University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty, including Copelovitch and other professors were gathered for panels organized by the Public Representation Organization of the Faculty Senate (PROFS) and the Academic Staff Professionals Representation Organization (ASPRO) to discuss shared challenges and the prospects for collective action to defend higher education.
UW-Madison is facing an array of challenges to its operations due to the federal government as over $12 million in research grants to UW-Madison have been cut and caps on indirect cost reimbursements for research grants at 15% represent another significant cut to research funds, and dozens of students across UW campuses and other schools had their visas cancelled. Copelovitch said it is part of a greater attempt to exert influence over the shape of universities across the country.
“What’s happening at Madison [is] terrible and horrible and has real world consequences specifically here,” Copelovitch said. “But again, it is part of a broader pattern that is affecting all the universities across the country. So far, most universities have treated the problems as institution-specific symptoms… That is the big challenge right now. How do you get dozens, if not hundreds of institutions, to start acting collectively to push back against this?”
The panelists said one of the big challenges that universities face is explaining to the public how their budgets work and the impacts of potential cuts.
UW-Madison Veterinary Medicine Research Administration Director Jenny Dahlberg said one lost grant will be “much more broad reaching” than some imagine. “This is an entire generation of scientists that no longer will have opportunities to conduct research. That is alarming,” she said. 
Dahlberg said faculty and staff need to find a way to protect their ability to speak freely about research and to train the next generation. 
Copelovitch said universities will have to communicate to the public about their budgets and recent attacks on academic freedom, and explain that if those things continue it “ultimately means that the universities that people think they’re going to send their kids to eventually are just not going to exist in that format.”
Don Moynihan, a University of Michigan professor and previously a UW-Madison faculty member, said conversations about whether universities are too reliant on federal funding miss the point. He said that investments into research at universities were part of a deal between universities and the government created at the end of World War II. 
“If you will help us with our goals of building out research infrastructure, we will ensure a steady flow of resources into that research infrastructure,” Moynihan said. “Now, we have one of those partners basically withdrawing from the partnership and not just withdrawing from the partnership, but also trying to dictate what the other party does, even though they’re bringing less resources to the table and that activity violated that contract.” 
Moynihan said there’s no way to manage the budget holes that could be created by cuts and that it’s not really feasible that the private sector could fill to gap.
“You’re going to accept or live with a much smaller campus that does much less research…  and that story will be true across lots of other research areas,” Moynihan said. 
Moynihan said the Trump’s administration’s letter to Harvard University, which demanded changes to its administration, student admissions process and called for audits into “DEI” across the campus, lays out a “full menu” of administration priorities. The administration said it would also be cutting over $2 billion in federal grants to the school. 
Moynihan said that it’s clear that individual universities making side deals won’t be a viable strategy. 
“Without collective action, there is not going to be any effective pushback against this administration,” Moynihan said.
Copelovitch said that he has been “heartened” to see the pushback in the last few weeks. UW-Madison Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin signed a letter together with hundreds of other higher education leaders to speak against the “unprecedented government overreach” and the “political interference now endangering American higher education.”  
Copelovitch said discussions about universities banding together, including a recent proposal that  Big Ten schools form a NATO-like agreement, will also be key. 
“No chancellor or provost is going to stick their neck out and lead the fray. Harvard is doing it a little bit, and Harvard can afford to do it, but leaders of any individual public institution are not going to do that, so there’s a need to speak collectively,” Copelovitch said. 
“Fragility” of U.S. democracy
The upheaval in U.S. institutions has gone beyond higher education, and at a separate event, titled “The Fragility and Performance of Democracy in the U.S.” hosted by the Elections Research Center on Thursday afternoon, focused on analyzing Trump’s attacks on the U.S. administrative state and the consolidation of executive power .
UW-Madison professor and director of the Elections Research Center Barry Burden said he didn’t think “any of us imagined we would see the kind of chaos that we’ve experienced these first 100 days,” but said the second Trump administration “has been so massively disruptive” and is “pushing the limits of what a democratic system can handle.” 
“It is doing things that previously seemed illegal, impossible, unimaginable or unconstitutional, and they’re happening daily and often with people who are not really part of the government or part of his party — people like Elon Musk and others — being brought in to do the hatchet work on federal agencies,” Burden said. 
Burden said that Trump is showing warning signs of a “personalized” president, which is often a warning sign for democracies.

“We’ve seen in other countries where a fairly elected leader, and [Trump] is a fairly elected leader, can nonetheless abuse the government against their enemies and make it a kind of weapon — whether it’s using the IRS for political purposes, or threatening judges or intimidating universities or journalists,” Burden said. “All of those things are using his power as president to get parts of society to bow to him and serve his interests.” 
Burden said the protests being held across the country at state Capitols, in small cities and towns — including in Wisconsin — in recent weeks are a sign that civil society is starting to rise up in opposition. 
“We’ve seen the public come back out of its hiding,” Burden said. He added that unpopularity amongst the public and public resistance — along with accountability by the courts and the media — are what has been essential in resisting autocrats in eastern Europe and Latin America as well. “It’s all hands on deck, really, to stop a Democratic government from sliding away.”
Burden said that people need to understand their place in upholding democracy.
“Democracy needs people to keep it flourishing,” Burden said. “It doesn’t operate on its own. We often think of it as a kind of system. You write a constitution, and it exists, and it’s in place, and it will just continue. That’s not how it works. It has to be sustained and tended to and protected. It takes a whole bunch of different actors. It takes the public being vigilant. It takes journalists, media outlets holding government accountable, and transmitting what’s happening. … and it takes political parties to govern themselves and keep bad elements out of government.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma lawsuit coming before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday could produce a landmark ruling on the role of religion in state-funded education.
At the center of the debate is St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, a church-backed online charter school that was approved to open in Oklahoma until the state Supreme Court struck it down in June. It would be the first publicly funded charter school in the nation to adopt a religion.
The case questions whether charter schools, long considered public, are truly an arm of the government and whether states should be able to deny a school access to taxpayer funding because it is religious.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa sought to open the online school to students of all backgrounds and faiths in Oklahoma, especially in rural areas that have no brick-and-mortar Catholic schools. State dollars would be the school’s primary source of funding.
However, St. Isidore would be unapologetically religious, teaching Catholic beliefs, requiring students to attend Mass and operating according to church doctrine. The archbishop of Oklahoma City and the bishop of Tulsa would choose the members of the school’s governing board.
The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, which has since dropped the word “virtual” from its name, approved St. Isidore in June 2023 to open as a state-funded entity. 
Attorney General Gentner Drummond asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to block the school from opening. The state’s highest court ruled in Drummond’s favor, finding the concept of a religious charter school unconstitutional. 
The matter is now in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, which announced in January it would consider the case. The Court, whose justices have a conservative majority, will hear oral arguments on Wednesday. A decision is expected by the end of June.

Oklahoma’s educational outcomes are too poor to turn down an institution like the Catholic church that has a history of academic success, said Brian Shellem, who leads the Statewide Charter School Board.
National testing showed Oklahoma was among the lowest-performing states in the country in 2024.
In an interview with Oklahoma Voice, Shellem said the state should take an “all-hands-on-deck approach” to give students better options. The statewide board’s objective, he said, is to encourage innovative school models.
“When we have a tornado come through, we don’t ask for someone’s religious beliefs,” Shellem said. “You just hear the chain saws firing up, the wood starts cutting. People come give food and water and shelter. With this crisis of our education, we need everyone to be chipping in. And when someone raises their hand and says, ‘We are willing, and we are able,’ should we say, ‘There’s the door’? Or (do) we say, ‘You obviously have a (strong) track record. Thank you for helping.’”
Introducing religion into public education doesn’t solve Oklahoma’s poor outcomes, said Drummond, the attorney general.
Drummond, who is running for Oklahoma governor, said the Catholic charter school would be “a new, shiny thing” but a distraction from making genuine improvements to reading and math levels. He said it could draw public funds away from existing school districts and hurt their performance.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and the head of Oklahoma’s public schools system, Superintendent Ryan Walters, have advocated for opening St. Isidore to expand educational options in the state. Both filed friend-of-the-court briefs for the U.S. Supreme Court to consider as it weighs its decision.

Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent. Allowing a state-funded charter school to adopt a faith “eviscerates” the state and federal Constitution’s prohibition of government-established religion, he told the state Supreme Court during oral arguments last year.
A ruling in favor of the Catholic school could upend charter programs across the country and open the door to schools adopting faith systems that Oklahomans might find objectionable, Drummond said.
“It’s a recipe for chaos and confusion for millions of charter school students, and that is a tragedy,” he told Oklahoma Voice. “I think it would create a patchwork, truly. You would probably have large states like New York, Colorado, California, discontinuing its charter school program because those states probably won’t tolerate the funding of sectarian education. A ruling against me, the state, would subject religious institutions to state regulations of which they’re typically immune.”
The crux of the case, both sides say, is who creates and controls a charter school. 
A charter school is only established in partnership with the state and is subject to regulations that apply to all public schools, therefore making it inextricably tied to the government and subject to church-state separation, the attorney general said.
Attorneys representing St. Isidore and the statewide board say creation and control of a charter school lie with its independent governing board, not the state. They equated charter schools to private institutions that are paid taxpayer funds to provide public services, like a church-affiliated hospital or construction companies hired to build city roads.

Similarly, charter schools are privately run entities contracted with the state, said Phil Sechler, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, a national conservative Christian legal group representing the statewide board.
Those private entities have a right to religious liberty, he said, so excluding them from public funding is religious discrimination. 
Previous Supreme Court rulings found religious groups cannot be excluded from government grants and school voucher programs. Permitting a religious charter school, though, would set a new precedent.
“The Statewide Charter School Board is treating St. Isidore exactly as the Constitution demands — neutrally,” Sechler said. “It’s not promoting religion. It’s not disfavoring it or being hostile to it.
“St. Isidore is simply trying not to be discriminated against because of its faith.”
Alliance Defending Freedom has been involved in other landmark cases, including the Mississippi lawsuit that resulted in the nation’s highest court overturning Roe v. Wade.
The nonprofit group is representing the Statewide Charter School Board for free, Sechler and Shellem said. Its chief legal counsel, Jim Campbell, will present oral arguments to the Supreme Court.
Michael H. McGinley of Dechert LLP will represent St. Isidore.
The Attorney General’s Office hired Washington, D.C., attorney Gregory Garre to represent Drummond at a cost of $250,000, according to the AG’s contract with Garre’s law firm, Latham & Watkins LLP.
If approved, St. Isidore would be open to students of all backgrounds and faiths, Catholic officials have said. Its contract with the Statewide Charter School Board pledged it would not deny students admission based on their religion, lack of faith, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.
Guiding principles for Oklahoma Catholic schools disagree with the concept of a gender identity that doesn’t match a person’s biological sex, according to guidance the Oklahoma City archdiocese and the Tulsa diocese released in 2021.
However, Catholic schools must ensure “the immeasurable dignity of every child is protected and respected,” the principles state.
All Catholic school students, including those who are LGBTQ+, are treated with human dignity and respect, said Michael Scaperlanda, chancellor of the Oklahoma City archdiocese.

“I think because the Catholic Church believes in the dignity of every human person, we respect the dignity of whoever comes to our school, whoever chooses to come to our school, and respect their freedom to either accept or reject or be curious about the Catholic faith,” Scaperlanda said. “That’s up to them.”
St. Isidore received more than 225 expressions of interest from students wishing to enroll, even with multiple lawsuits hanging over the school, Scaperlanda said. The archdiocese has stated its goal is to enroll up to 500 students in St. Isidore’s first year of operation.
Most of the families expressing interest came from rural areas, and only two attend a Catholic school currently, Scaperlanda said.
The idea for a virtual school had its genesis during the COVID-19 pandemic, Scaperlanda said, when Oklahoma Catholic schools pivoted to online instruction in March 2020. Catholic officials discovered “we could do this sort of education and do it very quickly and very well.”
An online school could make Catholic education available across the state, he said, and as a charter school, it could do so at no cost to families. 
Scaperlanda said Catholic leaders saw other private groups accessing charter school funding and wondered, “Why should we be left out of that?”
“If the state wants to provide these opportunities, it’s discriminatory to say, ‘Chickasaws, you can do this. STEM-minded folks, you can do this. All kinds of other folks can participate in this educational space, but religious groups can’t,’” he said.
It’s no surprise a publicly funded religious school emerged from Oklahoma, considered one of the most predominantly Republican states in the country, said House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City.

In her 15 years in the state Legislature, Munson has seen the GOP supermajority enact a variety of policies inspired by lawmakers’ religious faith — from a near-total abortion ban to a recent House resolution proclaiming “Christ is King.” 
Walters, who leads the Oklahoma State Department of Education, has ordered schools to teach from the Bible and keep a copy of it in every classroom.
Republican lawmakers, afraid of being challenged in a primary election, are “very nervous about standing up and just having real conversations around the separation of church and state,” said Munson, a Democratic candidate for governor.
She said that mindset, along with gerrymandering and straight-party voting, has distanced conservative elected officials from the wishes of Oklahoma voters. Her constituents, despite choosing a private religious education for their children, told her these efforts are “not what we want our government leaders working on.”
“I represent a district that is predominantly Republican and, I would say, religious,” Munson said. “I have Catholics, churches in my district, pretty well-known affluent ones. And they say, ‘This is not what we want in our public schools.’”

(Getty Images)FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — While biodegradable plastics currently account for a half percent of the hundreds of millions of tons of plastic produced annually, a growing demand for the alternative reflects consumer awareness and corporate response.
Researchers from Brazil, Germany and the United States document a multi-faceted global snapshot of the environmental aspects and trends surrounding single-use plastics in a review article titled “Rethinking single-use plastics: Innovations, policies, consumer awareness and market shaping biodegradable plastics in the packaging industry.” The piece was recently published in Trends in Food Science & Technology.
The researchers state that the largest area of application for biodegradable plastic materials is the packaging segment, which accounts for about half of single-use plastic production. The biodegradable packaging market was estimated to reach about $105 billion in 2024 with an expected annual growth rate of about 6 percent between 2024 and 2029, and 44 percent of patents filed worldwide for biodegradable polymers relate to packaging, the study noted.
About 474 million tons of plastics are produced globally each year, and about a third of it is used for packaging, including single-use plastic products for food and beverage containers. Of this, only about 25 percent gets recycled. Plastic production, the article adds, is expected to triple by 2060 following a trend of transitioning from durable plastics to single-use plastics.
Global plastic production increased from 369 million tons in 2016 to 404.5 million tons in 2020, partly due to materials used in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Citing a 2021 study from the same research group in Brazil, the review article noted the pandemic “exacerbated the use of single-use plastic and increased the demand for personal protective equipment and packaging, leading to remarkable growth in the plastics industry and generating more than 8 million tons of waste, mainly affecting Asia, Europe and America.” The same study mentions that the pandemic expanded food packaging due to a shift in eating habits and an increase in online purchases.
Despite the transition to single-use plastics, an increasing number of patents and successful research and development of biodegradable plastic materials has sparked the interest of industries to invest in large-scale production technologies for renewable monomers and polymers, the researchers added.
 Looking to corn


“There is a lot of opportunity with zein, which is a family of proteins in corn that forms a beautiful film to make biodegradable plastics, and it’s a little bit more expensive, but we hope that will be hitting the market soon as well,” said Sun Ferreira, a co-author of the study and an assistant professor in the food science department for University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture and the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences. Ferreira is part of both the research and extension arms of the Division of Agriculture, the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station and the Cooperative Extension Service.

Ferreira is a food scientist and food processing engineer who has worked with biopolymers for microencapsulation to protect flavors, vitamins and other ingredients during processing, storage and digestion. He collaborated with the study’s lead author, Andreza Salles Barone, a nutritionist and Ph.D. candidate with the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro’s Food and Nutrition Graduate Program.

Barone is supervised by Ana Elizabeth Cavalcante Fai, corresponding author for the review article, a food engineer and associate professor in food science at Rio de Janeiro State University, where she coordinates the Laboratory of Multidisciplinary Practices for Sustainability at the Institute of Nutrition.
“Food packaging plays a vital role in ensuring food safety and quality,” Fai said. “However, it is increasingly unjustifiable to produce short-life cycle packaging using synthetic plastics that persist in the environment for up to 400 years. Even more concerning is the growing awareness that plastics don’t degrade completely — they fragment into micro- and nanoplastics, which are now recognized as widespread environmental pollutants and an emerging public health concern.”
Ferreira said that while biodegradable plastics are a promising long-term alternative solution, it is not where he expects to see the biggest short-term impact on the reduction of overall plastic use.
Fai and Barone said that plastic has undeniably transformed modern life since its mass production began in the 1950s. However, despite its versatility and usefulness, “plastic has often been misused and is frequently applied to single-use items which are discarded with little regard for environmental consequences.”
“Most of the plastic ever made still exists in some form today,” Fai said. “When people say, ‘just throw it away,’ we must remember — there is no ‘away.’ Everything remains within the boundaries of our shared environment. The planet simply cannot absorb this volume of waste indefinitely. If current trends continue, some projections estimate that by 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in our oceans. This is not just alarming — it’s a call to urgent action.”
A “circular economy,” Ferreira said, could have a larger long-term impact on single-use plastic reduction. A circular economy broadens the familiar slogan of “reduce, reuse, recycle” to “rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, repair and recycle,” in that order.
Brazil has an extraordinary biodiversity, Fai said, and a significant agro-industrial biomass base, rich in polysaccharides such as starch, pectin, lignin, and others. These valuable raw materials can be transformed into bio-based and biodegradable packaging for the food industry, she added.
“Through international partnerships, where each research group contributes its unique expertise, we can join efforts to develop sustainable and innovative packaging solutions,” Fai said. “This collaborative approach is key to building a more sustainable future for food systems worldwide,” said Fai and Barone.
“We are part of the problem as consumers, but at the end of the day, as consumers we can be part of the solution,” Ferreira said.
Co-authors of the review article on single-use plastics include Carollyne Maragoni-Santos of Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro; Patricia Marques de Farias of the Sustainable Packaging Institute in Germany; Camila Marcolongo Gomes Cortat of the Laboratory of Multidisciplinary Practices of Sustainability, Institute of Nutrition at the State University of Rio de Janeiro; Bianca Chieregato Maniglia of the University of São Paulo; and Ricardo Schmitz Ongaratto in the chemistry school at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
 Plastics on the farm

Heather Friedrich, director of the Center for Arkansas Farms and Food, said while there are a lot of plastics used in agriculture, her team avoids single-use plastics as much as possible out of concern for the environment and to reduce consumption.

“In our transplant production, rather than using the single-use plastics that you see in a store when you get plants, we use extra sturdy plastic transplant trays,” Friedrich said. “We know farmers who have used these for 20-plus years and are still strong.”
Friedrich said the CAFF farm also uses a paper pot system adapted from Japan that uses a chain of paper strips to form cells in which they grow the transplants. The training farm also uses a landscape fabric instead of plastic mulch for weed control, which can be reused over many years.
However, use of single-use plastic is unavoidable at times. For its “tractor-scale” production, CAFF uses the black plastic seen on strawberry beds at u-pick operations.
“Plants respond well to plasticulture because it warms the soil early, creates a weed free zone and delivers water directly to the plant roots,” Friedrich said. “The current biodegradable options for this function can’t hold up over the long, hot season.”
A thick, clear plastic is used to cover high tunnels at the farm, but that material has a longer lifespan of four to six years. High tunnels differ from greenhouses by generally having less climate control but still allow protection of plants from the elements and extend the growing season from early spring to late fall.
Irrigation drip tape — a flat tubing that provides water directly to plant roots — can also be a source of plastic on the farm, Friedrich said, and they try to use theirs for multiple years to minimize landfill deposits.
“In other areas of the state, there are recycling options that farmers can off-load their irrigation plastic,” Friedrich said.
Polypipe is commonly used for irrigation in row crop operations. When the season has ended, farmers roll up the pipe and drop it off for recycling.
The Center for Arkansas Farms and Food was developed to strengthen and expand our food and farming system by providing new opportunities to shape our current and future farmers, food entrepreneurs and food system leaders. CAFF is a program of the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station through the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.
Through experiential learning, the center’s programs train farmers and food entrepreneurs with the production and business skills and resources necessary to develop resilient businesses that sustain our ecosystem, our land and our communities.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)At a time when my classmates were learning the building blocks of reading, my first grade teacher was informing my mother that I’d be illiterate.
Let’s just say that learning my teacher had washed her hands of me solely because I wasn’t hooked on phonics went over like a lead balloon with my mother, a former classroom teacher whose education degree featured a speciality in reading.
Every day after school that year, my mother worked with me at home, teaching me how to read. Thanks to her tutelage, by the time I reached second grade I was reading at grade level. And by third grade, I was reading well above it. 
That lived experience of having a first-grade teacher who didn’t have the slightest idea how to teach a core foundational subject to a struggling student is one of the reasons I’m positively petrified by Oklahoma lawmakers’ absurd plan to put people without teaching experience — or even any college education — at the helm of our pre-K through third grade classrooms.
Supporters say hiring these so-called “adjuncts,” who must only have “distinguished qualifications in their field,” will help address our state’s ongoing teacher shortage. Opponents suspect hiring untrained teachers could cause long-term negative consequences for our youngest students.
Oklahoma lawmakers were the first in the nation to try this failed experiment with our older grades, and it’s worked so well that we still have some of the worst academic outcomes in the nation as trained teachers continue to leave the profession in droves. 
So, it is mindboggling that we’d now want to expand this concept to our youngest students who desperately need qualified teachers who know how to manage classrooms and teach foundational skills.
Because one thing I’ve learned from virtual school days is that it is not easy to teach my children, who are in their foundational grades, despite me theoretically having “distinguished qualifications” in reading and writing by way of winning journalism awards and leading a newsroom.
It terrifies me that our crippling teacher shortage has led us to a point where we think it’s prudent to use people with no formal education training to teach our youngest children the building blocks that they’ll need to be successful throughout life.
I could see allowing districts to temporarily hire people who are enrolled in college and maybe a few hours away from the completion of their education degree, but we’d have to be crazy — or desperate — to entrust someone untrained to teach reading just because they can read well.
In response to criticism, some Republicans now propose requiring adjuncts to complete training on how to teach children to read — by the end of their second year in the classroom.
What about the poor kids who are placed in that adjunct’s classroom that first year? Are they disposable? Why is it suddenly OK to allow some children to fall through the cracks and be victims of our adult leaders’ inability to keep qualified educators in their classroom?
I could have been one of the children who fell through the cracks had I not had a determined mother with an education degree at home.
Because while I arrived in second grade able to read, I discovered I lacked the basic math skills required because my first-grade teacher didn’t teach that subject at all. I suspect she didn’t know how, and as a result, I spent several weeks taking remedial courses to get caught up.
Years later, I still remember how miserable — and confusing — it was to be behind my peers. My class didn’t stop to wait for me to get caught up. My second-grade teacher continued to build on what I was supposed to have already learned.
We’re at a crossroads, and my question is do we want our classrooms to produce well-educated students? Or do we want our schools to be little more than a babysitting service?
If lawmakers want our schools to simply be low-paid babysitters, then be brave enough to admit it. But I suspect they don’t want to say the quiet part out loud because their constituents — and businesses — demand that we produce students who are literate in math and reading.
If we can’t get qualified people to teach, then lawmakers need to do some soul searching and figure out what’s fundamentally wrong with how they’re doing things. 
Every child should have someone in their life like my mother, who can fill the gaps, but they don’t. Our lawmakers should be moving mountains to ensure every child has the best teachers in their public school classrooms, not taking dangerous short cuts that put student outcomes at risk.

It's Workers Memorial Day. Yet Wyoming elected officials mostly silent in wake of yet another alarming report of workplace carnage, advocates say.
The post Labor advocates: Most lethal state in the nation for workers ignores blue-collar plight appeared first on WyoFile .","In 2023, a worker died after falling through a skylight on a construction job. Another died after being thrown from a front-end loader. Yet another was buried in a trench collapse and two were crushed by vehicles they were either inspecting or repairing at the time, according to the Wyoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s fatal accident alerts website.
The five “alerts” — limited to two sentences or less — belie the actual extent of occupational fatalities in Wyoming that year. Forty-five workers died on the job in 2023 — a 32.4% increase over the previous year and the deadliest since 2007, according to the state’s most recent annual report on workplace fatalities. 
Unless a local newsroom reports on a workplace fatality, or there’s civil litigation, most victims’ names disappear into the maw of multiple bureaucracies where extracting the type of information that might point to problem areas and potential solutions is frustratingly difficult, advocates and officials say.
“These aren’t just statistics — they’re our neighbors, family members and fellow Wyomingites,” Wyoming AFL-CIO Executive Director Marcie Kindred said in a prepared statement.

Today is Workers Memorial Day. Workers and their advocates will gather at the steps of the Capitol in Cheyenne beginning at 5:30 p.m. to commemorate the dozens of lives lost each year while on the job in Wyoming. The workplace tragedies are not only preventable but so frequent that Wyoming has ranked the worst or among the worst in the nation — on a per-capita basis — for decades, according to federal data.
The state doesn’t appear to be on track to shed its deadly distinction.
Last year was comparably deadly, though there’s no official tally yet, and at least four workers have died on the job so far this year, according to Wyoming OSHA. They include: David Wesley Moore, 58, of Douglas, killed in a natural gas compressor station fire in Converse County; Alexander Harsha, 22, of Rock Springs, hit by a door that was struck by a forklift in Sweetwater County; Liam Cobb, 19, of Casper, died by suicide, falling from a wind tower in Carbon County; and Denice Downing, 47, of Gillette, killed in a tanker-truck explosion in Campbell County.
“Year after year, we gather [on Workers Memorial Day] to honor those we’ve lost, yet we see no meaningful improvement in workplace safety,” Kindred said. “We need concrete action to protect Wyoming’s workers.”
Despite the state’s December report confirming yet another notch to Wyoming’s dishonor as the “deadliest,” it doesn’t appear that the carnage — including the hardships families face — is a priority among elected officials. Past state-level initiatives, along with some industry-led safety efforts, seem to have fallen by the wayside, advocates say. Rather than a call to action to understand how to make Wyoming workplaces safer, Kindred said, worker advocates had to fight this year to defeat a measure to reduce unemployment benefits.

Kindred said she recently told union members: “Your elected officials spent your taxpayer dollars arguing about pronouns and bathrooms. Meanwhile, we’re dying out here.”
Each year, the Wyoming AFL-CIO, along with the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, pleads with lawmakers to take on the worker fatality crisis as an interim topic, and each year, legislative leadership declines. 
“I don’t think we value workers in Wyoming like we should,” said Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association Executive Director Marcia Shanor, who has advocated for workplace safety for decades. “If we did, we would never tolerate 45 people being killed without asking about it.”
What’s driving the crisis?
The 45 occupational fatalities in 2023 made Wyoming the most lethal state in the nation for workers on a per-capita basis — by a long shot. 
Wyoming recorded 16 fatalities per 100,000 workers, according to the most recent federal data available. North Dakota was second at 9.8 deaths per 100,000 workers, and Mississippi followed at 6.9 deaths per 100,000 workers.

Agriculture, ranching and forestry were among the most deadly work sectors, according to the state’s annual report, followed by mining and oil and natural gas extraction. Across all industries, highway crashes and vehicular accidents accounted for 67% of all occupational fatalities in 2023.
At face value, workplace fatalities can appear to be “random” from year to year, according to Wyoming OSHA Program Manager Christian Graham. It’s tempting, he said, to point to Wyoming’s often-hazardous driving conditions, or unregulated ranch work, or employees shirking safety protocols. 
“There’s so many instances where sometimes these can be prevented if we just slow down and pay attention,” Graham said.
Yet, it’s difficult to derive from data what exactly is behind Wyoming’s worker fatality problem, Graham cautioned. The labor, safety and workforce regulatory world is full of reductive reports and databases that, individually, don’t reveal root causes or how to address them. To understand and effectively address what plagues workplace safety, Graham said, requires deep, ongoing analysis and interaction with employers and employees. Wyoming OSHA and the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services do have those conversations with both employers and employees, he said. The agencies also oversee multiple programs that go beyond inspections and enforcement to provide services such as safety training and voluntary consultations.

“One death is too many,” Graham said, adding that more resources are always welcome. “We do our best while we’re out there to present our programs, and we’re completing our inspections throughout the state.”
Though workplace inspections and training programs are vital, the state does not do enough to hold employers accountable, Kindred said. She bristles when people chalk up the state’s track record to vehicle accidents and on-the-job suicides and homicides — which are included in the state’s tally.
“We also have the highest rates of suicide in the nation, and that’s a workers’ issue,” Kindred said. “If they’re doing it on the job, these are deaths of despair because they’re at this job they hate that doesn’t pay enough and they can’t support their families.
“And if a lot of these [vehicle fatalities] are out-of-state truckers,” Kindred added, “we need to make sure they’re prepared. We need to be better neighbors. If people are sending their workers to Wyoming and they’re dying, that’s not the reputation we want.”
There’s always a desire to pin the blame on workers for taking short cuts or not following procedures without acknowledging the pressures they’re under and things they don’t have control over, like improperly maintained equipment or the right tools for the job, said Tyson Logan, a partner at the Spence Law Firm, which specializes in workers’ rights.

“We see it all the time,” Logan said. “Wyoming workers are going out to do their job and being killed because of corporate negligence or recklessness. And what we see again and again is that companies just aren’t making their workers’ safety a priority.”
Most employers provide proper training and equipment and encourage a culture of safety, Logan said, noting a slow cultural shift over decades.
“It’s daunting, though. The problem is it’s not every company or every job,” he said. “When the economy is not as strong, companies tend to take more risks. When there’s fewer people, there’s more expectations and trying to do more with less. That’s when people get hurt.”
There are myriad inherent on-the-job risks in Wyoming, including long commutes to remote locations and working around heavy equipment, said Rep. Lee Filer, a Republican from Cheyenne who owns a company that builds and operates data centers.
“Every bit of the equipment they’re running, none of it is forgiving,” Filer said. “If it’s a forklift or front-end loader, that’s thousands of pounds hitting you. So it doesn’t take much.”
Despite embracing safe workplace practices while serving in the military and as a union representative with the railroad, Filer admits he lost a fingertip to a saw blade due to his own recklessness.

“I did it myself,” he said. “But I do the best I can to make sure that my crew is safe. I always tell them, ‘Come let me know if you have a concern,’ because I don’t want anybody getting hurt. And I’ve been pretty successful with that.”
Too many workers, however, feel they’re under pressure and don’t speak up, he said. His biggest worry is worker fatigue and commuting to and from work.
“It could be mandatory overtime issues where people maybe work 12 hours, 16 hours, then have to drive home,” Filer said. “Wyoming is always going to have a bad rap on this because of our shift work. A lot of our industries — the coal mines and railroads — those places are 24/7 operations.”
What’s being done about it?
Beginning in the 2000s, a spike in fatalities and injuries that coincided with a coalbed methane and natural gas drilling boom spurred advocates like the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, Wyoming AFL-CIO and the Equality State Policy Center to increase pressure on leaders in Cheyenne.
The response wasn’t immediate. But eventually, the state organized special hearings and there was a genuine statewide discussion about how to make workplaces safer, according to Shanor, who played a key advocacy role. Industries responded, too, forming the Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance, the Wyoming Transportation Safety Coalition and a new safety training center in Casper.

There were even modest reforms — which were hard-fought, Shanor said — such as an annual cost-of-living adjustment and an increase in death benefits under the Wyoming Workers’ Compensation program. The Legislature in 2014 considered increasing fines and penalties for egregious safety violations to dissuade what some referred to as a “disposable worker” attitude among some employers in the region. The state even created an occupational epidemiologist position at Wyoming Workforce Services to not only analyze workplace fatality and injury data, but to coordinate information among multiple, siloed agencies that investigate worker fatalities to help identify strategies to do something about it.
The drive to finally address Wyoming’s workplace fatality epidemic, however, petered out, Shanor said. 
The Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance is no longer active, according to Wyoming OSHA, and the Wyoming Transportation Safety Coalition is trying to regain footing. The state recently reclassified the occupational epidemiologist post to an “OSHA compliance assistance position,” which means the state is no longer performing the deep analysis of root causes like it had in the past.
OSHA defended the changes as enhancing “our ability to support health and safety throughout the state by guiding rule and standard development, conducting outreach, and being an accessible resource.”
But Shanor, the workforce safety advocate, doesn’t see it that way. 
“That’s a huge loss,” she said. 
“I just think we lack leadership,” she added. “I worry that maybe we let them off the hook after COVID.”

Kindred, of the AFL-CIO, was more blunt.
“[Wyoming leaders] like to talk about our work ethic and how we love our workers; We get the job done and we don’t complain,” Kindred said. “But when it comes time to put our policies and our efforts where our mouth is, we just want workers to be our mascot. We don’t really want to support them in any way.”
It’s disheartening, Kindred added, because Wyoming really is the place where people will pull over to help a stranger broken down on the side of the road. “That’s why our continued inaction on workplace safety is so jarring. It contradicts our fundamental values.”
Filer, who served on the Labor, Health and Social Services Committee during his first stint in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2014, said he’s seen a shift in the Legislature from solving Wyoming problems to adhering to ideology.
“Worker safety, to me, is not an ideology or political position,” Filer said. “It’s something that everybody can probably agree on — that everybody wants to come home to their family when they get off work.”

Filer said he’s in favor of asking for more detailed reports, analysis and ideas from Wyoming Workforce Services and Wyoming OSHA, and generally prioritizing the workplace fatality epidemic at the Legislature. While he’s adamantly opposed to regulations, some are necessary, like “OSHA laws,” Filer said. “There’s a reason those [laws] are on the books. It’s because they were written in blood.”
Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee Co-Chair Rep. Landon Brown, a Republican from Cheyenne, said he wants the panel to take up the worker transportation safety issue this year. 
Labor Committee co-chairs Sen. Eric Barlow of Gillette and Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams of Cody, both Republicans, did not respond to WyoFile’s inquiry about whether the committee will take on the issue. 
Among the committee’s proposed topics this year, however, is to consider lowering — again — what employers pay into the workers’ compensation program to “promote a more business-friendly environment” and “random” drug and alcohol testing of employees at state-funded institutions.
“It is time to reenergize this conversation and return worker safety to the forefront where it belongs,” Shanor said. “This silence is not just troubling; it is unacceptable.”

The Biden administration proposed a rule that would have required state Medicaid programs to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, but the Trump administration said it will leave the option up to the states. (Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University


GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

It took nearly two years and some international maneuvering, but now those protective jackets, pants, boots, helmets and air tanks are headed to the city of about 75,000 in the mountainous state of Michoacan, Mexico — to be used by a volunteer team Perez said relied on donations to build their station and a hodgepodge of items for body protection.
“This is about a good humanitarian act where we have equipment we have to dispose of that still has a lot of life in it and can be of use to people who need it,” said Perez, who has lived in Nebraska since age 8 when his family emigrated from Zacapu.
 Cultural pride

Perez joined Columbus Fire Chief Ryan Gray, the Omaha-based Mexican Consul and a few dozen others last week at a reception at Bellevue University that marked the donation — and a celebratory visit by the mayor of Zacapu, Mónica Valdez Pulido. 
While in Nebraska for four days, Valdez, who in Mexico is known as la presidente municipal de Zacapu, finalized details for the delivery, met with officials involved and visited local communities where many natives of Michoacan have settled.
At a time when many immigrants feel threatened and unwelcome by policies of the Trump administration, Nebraska Latino leaders embraced the cross-border collaboration and act of international goodwill as an occasion to spotlight cultural ties and pride.

“May this moment inspire us all to keep building bridges of collaboration, friendship, and brotherhood,” Yesenia Peck, of the Nebraska Hispanic Chamber Foundation, said at last week’s reception.
Peck called the occasion more than just a transfer of equipment. 
“It is a powerful reminder that when communities come together, even across borders, we can create lasting impact,” she said, and in this case, support those who risk their own well-being to help protect others.
Valdez — the first woman mayor of her city, in a nation led by its first female president — told the group that she looked forward to a continued alliance with Nebraska and Columbus, whose population of about 25,000 is now more than 26% Latino. 
 Saving lives, protecting their own  

Statewide, about 12% of Nebraska identifies as being Hispanic or Latino, according to the U.S. Census, with the bulk of those being of Mexican descent.

Valdez pointed out new partnerships built in the process with Omaha-based Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes, whose office represents the Mexican government in Nebraska and Iowa, and Karina Perez, executive director of Columbus-based Centro Hispano Comunitario de Nebraska, a nonprofit formed in 2009 to help connect the influx of immigrant families to their new communities. 
Columbus now has two Latinas on the City Council, both of whom were in the audience.
Also attending the Bellevue reception was Omaha’s first female fire chief, Kathy Bossman, and Sergio Robles, the Omaha Fire Department’s public education specialist.
Valdez called the gift and partnership a “historic” occasion and noted that the  Zacapu bomberos are volunteers who fight fires and do so with inferior protective gear.
“With the right equipment, they’ll be able to continue to save lives but also to protect their own lives,” she said. The Zacapu team was arranging to pay to transport the gear from Columbus to Mexico.
 Remembering his roots

Valdez offered a particular shoutout to Aaron Perez, noting that despite having grown up mostly in Nebraska, “he has not forgotten his roots.”
Perez, in an interview, recalled nearly two years ago when his Columbus Fire Department was preparing to get rid of the outdated equipment. Age put the gear outside acceptable U.S. safety standards, but Perez said it was still useful. 
He recalled photos and conversations from his parents’ recent visit to Zacapu. He said the city’s volunteer firefighting gear appeared to be “pieced together” from other places. What Columbus had to offer included an ensemble for about 40 firefighters, including bunker jackets, pants, boots, helmets, hoods, masks and breathing packs.

Gray, the Columbus fire chief, said his current force includes 32 paid firefighters and eight reserves, who get paid an hourly rate when activated. Because of U.S. firefighting standards, options for expired equipment are limited, he said.
“Even though we may not be able to use it here, it doesn’t mean other places can’t use it to help fulfill their duties,” said Gray. “It really came down to the message of humanity and helping other communities.”
He said the City of Columbus views the donation of its taxpayer-funded equipment as an extension of its investment.
The effort was accelerated when Valdez took office about seven months ago, said Perez, who said she was more enthused about the idea than her predecessor. 
“I feel really thankful that our city, our department, and everybody else here was willing and able to do this,” said Perez, 34, who is hoping to return to his hometown soon to see the safety gear in action. 



 Mexican heritage runs deep in Husker state 

Asked to speak about the Mexican settlement in Nebraska, Omahan Cesar Garcia offered full disclosure: He is a native of Colombia.
He smiled, saying many assume he is from Mexico, which has the oldest and still largest share of the state’s Latino population. “And that is a big honor, an amazing thing,” he said, noting that he’s come to know Mexican culture and history better in the 27 years he’s lived in the state.

Garcia, as executive director of nonprofit Canopy South, is based in South Omaha, where Garcia said his team works to build up housing, jobs and other opportunities in a community largely composed of immigrants, refugees and families of Mexican descent.
He spoke at an event last week marking the visit of a Mexican contingent led by the mayor of Zacapu, Mónica Valdez Pulido. That a Colombia-born Latino leader was describing the area’s Mexican immigration patterns provides insight into the expanding population in Nebraska.
The diversity was noticeable among organizers and attendees of the reception at Bellevue University. Speakers included Yesenia Peck, originally of Peru, and Karina Perez, whose parents emigrated from El Salvador originally to California.
Those in the audience included a representative of the local Guatemalan Consulate, along with a team from the Mexican Consulate, both based in Omaha. 
Later generations of Spanish-speaking immigrants were represented in the audience, part of the 12% of Nebraskans who, according to the latest Census data, identified as Hispanic or Latino.
A further breakdown of 2022 Census estimates, by the Office of Latin American Studies at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, showed that Latin Americans make up about half of the 7.5% of the state’s population born in a foreign country.
Among those native born in Latin America: 62% are from Mexico; 14% from Guatemala; 7% from El Salvador; nearly 5% from Cuba; nearly 4% from Honduras and 8% from other countries in Latin America.
Garcia told the group that Nebraska’s Mexican population swelled in the early 1900s, as immigrants were lured largely by jobs picking beets in western Nebraska and in South Omaha’s meatpacking industry.
South Omaha was known as a landing point for European and Latin American newcomers as far back as the late 1800s. Garcia said many European families have moved to western and suburban areas, while many old and new Latino families remain. 
He told the group that Mexican and Latino culture is an economic driver in areas such as South Omaha and has become mainstream in various ways throughout the state. 
“There is no corner in the state of Nebraska where you won’t find a Mexican restaurant,” Garcia said. “It’s part of American culture.”

“As land management agencies governing these wilderness areas have seen — and expect to continue to see — dramatic shifts in capacity so far this year, a stable, consistent base of volunteers to look after our Central Idaho trails is key to keeping these shared spaces maintained,” Idaho Conservation League officials said in a written statement. “If you spend some of your summer recreating in Central Idaho’s beautiful wilderness areas and are concerned about the use, accessibility, and wildness of these spectacular places, this program is for you.”
Applications for the Wilderness Stewards program are available online and are due by May 2. 
New wilderness stewards volunteers are required to complete training June 7 at the Sawtooth National Recreation Area headquarters in Ketchum. After they are accepted into the program, wilderness stewards will be asked to complete four patrols between June and September.

Wilderness stewards patrol the Sawtooth Wilderness, Hemingway-Boulders Wilderness, Cecil D. Andrus-White Clouds Wilderness, Craters of the Moon National Monument, Jim McClure-Jerry Peak Wilderness and recommended wilderness areas in the Sawtooth and Salmon-Challis national forests.
The Wilderness Stewards Program began in 2016. 
Since the program launched, wilderness stewards have packed 200 pounds of trash out of Idaho wilderness areas, cleared or naturalized 761 illegal fire rings and removed 182 human waste issues, according to the Idaho Conservation League.
Wilderness stewards also share Leave No Trace principles with other trail users they meet. Since 2016, wilderness stewards have engaged with 120,775 other trail users, the Idaho Conservation League reported. 
Founded in 1973, the Idaho Conservation League is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization with offices in Boise, Sandpoint, Ketchum and McCall that works to protect air, water, land and wildlife.

(Photo courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an email.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Johnathan Cohen/Getty Images)It was a stunning loss for Idaho’s agricultural community: On April 16 the U.S. Department of Agriculture withdrew a $59 million grant from the University of Idaho’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Communities grant was designed to help state agriculture producers develop more sustainable business practices as part of the Farmers First initiative. Before the termination, 201 Idaho producers representing 34 counties had already signed up for the program.
Federal government terminates University of Idaho climate grant for farmers

A University of Idaho press release said many of the producers had completed all the paperwork and were enrolled, others were in the final stages of enrollment.
In Idaho, agribusiness is 20 percent of the state’s industrial backbone. Agribusiness includes crops, seed, dairy, livestock, wine and beer cultivation and sales. This makes agriculture the state’s number one industry, followed by lumber, chemicals and paper, mining and tourism.
Overall, Idaho is the seventh largest agribusiness state in the country, led by livestock and dairy sales at more than 50 percent of all agribusiness sales. Any assistance to this large industry can only help the state grow.
Historically, this was the largest grant to UI in school history. When the new administration drew up new guidelines, the USDA withdrew the grant because Idaho’s plan fell short of the requirements.
How short? The new guidelines would require the program, titled the UI Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Program, to allocate at least 65 percent of the money to go to producers. Under the withdrawn grant, UI allocated more than 50 percent of the funds to go directly to state producers. The remaining nearly 50 percent was allocated for grant management and providing technical and marketing services to the enrolled producers.
UI can reapply, but there is no guarantee one will be awarded or that the school will receive same amount of money as the original grant. The deadline for the new Advanced Markets for Producers initiative is June 20.
Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Program co-director Sanford Eigenbrode said while disappointed, the UI is in a good position to re-apply for the grant by reconfiguring the numbers to meet the new guidelines.
Why was the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Communities grant eliminated? According to the federal government, it was because it was a Biden-era program. Under the current administration, just about anything that came from the previous administration is being labeled “bad” and being removed.
The grants were designed to help any state’s agribusinesses better compete in the world marketplace. Under the Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Program, information gathered by UI faculty, staff and students provided technical support and guidance to Idaho producers, helping them make better informed decisions about their financial bottom line. Overall, the program was designed to help reduce risks to agribusinesses and help them engage in new practices.
Granted, many people say the administrative costs of such programs can be high when run through a university. Often, depending on the university and the grant, administrative costs can run as high as 50 percent or more.
To better help Idaho’s agribusiness community, UI and other state universities need to adjust their administrative costs so more money can flow to the intended targets, in this case, the farmers and ranchers.
But even more needs to be done. As indicated, there is no guarantee that the grant will be re-issued to Idaho. This should now be priority work for the state’s congressional delegation. In Washington, D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators and House members need to engage with their staff members and the USDA to regain at least part of, if not all, the grant money.
Failing to do so would mean the congressional delegation will be unsuccessfully representing their primary constituents: Idaho’s very large rural and agribusiness communities.
Anyone who has lived here knows Idaho is much more than potatoes. The state’s agribusinesses are vital to the state’s economic well-being.
To help improve especially small agribusinesses, it is time for schools to adjust their overhead expenses and for those elected officials to truly help their constituents by fighting for a reinstatement of the Farmers First philosophy grant.

(Photo: Getty Images)Legislation to guarantee teen victims of sexual assault the right to a forensic rape exam without parental consent failed in the Tennessee Legislature last week, despite drawing strong bipartisan support.
The legislation was brought as a technical fix to the 2024 “Families’ Rights and Responsibilities Act,” which established a parent’s right to “make all physical and mental healthcare decisions for the child and consent to all physical and mental health care on the child’s behalf.”
The legislation was among the most recent brought in reaction to the lingering impacts of COVID-era vaccine and testing mandates. Tennessee lawmakers have already passed legislation requiring parental consent for all vaccines.
But forensic rape exams, which include collecting evidence for law enforcement and providing medical care and support to victims, were not explicitly made an exception to the 2024 parental consent law, which adds hefty penalties for healthcare providers who fail to comply: parents have the right to sue doctors and nurses who fail to get their consent, and healthcare providers may face professional discipline, including the loss of their licenses.
As a result, some sexual assault centers in Tennessee are interpreting the law as tying their hands in serving teens without a parent’s permission and have turned young victims away to avoid legal repercussions, victim advocates in Tennessee said this week.
TBI makes progress in reducing rape kit backlog

“We have ended up with programs across the state interpreting this law differently,” said Jennifer Escue, CEO of the Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic & Sexual Violence. At least one sexual assault center in East Tennessee has told her it has been unable to serve teen victims on the advice of its attorneys, she said. 
“The consequences of this are potentially devastating,” Escue said. “It takes so much courage, so much bravery, to seek out an exam. To be denied that…they could very well decide they don’t want to go through with reporting the crime. It denies an opportunity for collecting evidence, and it might be that someone who is sexually assaulting a minor goes free.”
Most teenagers do inform their parents, Escue said. But others may feel reluctant or afraid. 
Teens are far more likely to have been victimized by someone inside their home or within their family circle, including a parent. A 2024 Tennessee law allowing the death penalty for child rape convictions may add to the reluctance by even nonoffending adults to consent to a teen’s rape exam if the perpetrator is known to them, she noted. 
The Sexual Assault Center in Nashville continues to provide forensic exams to teens 14 and older, a practice it has opted not to change with the passage of the 2024 law, said Rachel Freeman, president of the Sexual Assault Center in Nashville.
Facing criticism for turning away victims, Murfreesboro hospital to ‘rebuild’ sex assault program

“We’ve had legal counsel saying they can interpret this either way,” she said. “We’ve decided it’s worth the risk, and the right thing to do is provide exams to minors who need them.”
“This is time sensitive,” Freeman said. “It cannot be done after 96 hours. That’s a very short period of time to try and convince, let’s say a mother, to try and get a rape kit.” 
The bill by Sen. Heidi Campbell and Rep. Bob Freeman, both Nashville Democrats, would have explicitly ensured that the “consent of a parent or guardian is not required for the victim to receive a forensic medical examination” for minors who are victims of sex crimes. 
The measure easily sailed through legislative committees and received a rare unanimous vote on the House floor. 
Then it stalled on the Senate floor last week after Sen. Adam Lowe, a Republican from Calhoun, raised the spectre of children as young as his elementary school-aged daughter undergoing a rape exam over allegations that did not involve a parent as perpetrator.
“Someone could take my daughter for an examination without notifying me,” Lowe said. “That would be a very potent and traumatizing experience.”
Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican who previously voted in favor of the bill in committee, then moved to send the bill back for further committee debate, citing “serious concerns” raised by Lowe and effectively killing the measure for the year. 
Victim advocates said Lowe’s concerns are based on a misunderstanding of systems in place to address child rape and sexual abuse. 
  “The reality is a five-year-old is not going to get a medical legal rape kit,” said Rep. Bob Freeman, a Nashville Democrat. (Photo: John Partpilo/Tennessee Lookout)
The Sexual Assault Center in Nashville does not provide rape exams to elementary-school-aged children. The agency serves victims starting at age 16, Freeman said. 
Child sex abuse victims 13 and younger are typically referred to Child Advocacy Centers and undergo a separate pediatric forensic process, Law enforcement and the Department of Children’s Services are notified. 
“The reality is a five year old is not going to get a medical legal rape kit,” Freeman said. 
Like all sexual assault centers, Freeman’s agency is a mandatory reporter of child abuse: the assault on any victim under the age of 18 who visits the center is reported to the Department of Children’s Services and law enforcement, which, in turn, contact non-offending parents.
“They certainly pull in parents when that happens,” Freeman said. “The reality is that the people who need to know will end up knowing.
Freeman worries that teens in Tennessee will be discouraged from seeking out help after being sexually assaulted but stressed that sexual assault centers will help them. 
A statewide crisis line can direct teens and other victims to available services and resources. The Tennessee Statewide Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 to provide support and information to sexual assault survivors: 866-811-7473.

Six of its Kentucky chapters have been affected by federal funding cuts, leading them to curtail community events including cleanup days, in which chapter members gather used syringes off the street, pass out the overdose reversal medication naloxone, and talk to people using drugs about the possibility of recovery. (Billy O’Bryan)This story was originally published by KFF Health News. 
When the Trump administration cut more than $11 billion in COVID-era funds to states in late March, addiction recovery programs suffered swift losses.
An Indiana organization that employs people in recovery to help peers with substance use disorders and mental illness was forced to lay off three workers. A Texas digital support service for people with addiction and mental illness prepared to shutter its 24/7 call line within a week. A Minnesota program focused on addiction in the East African community curtailed its outreach to vulnerable people on the street.
Although the federal assistance was awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic and some of the funds supported activities related to infectious disease, a sizable chunk went to programs on mental health and addiction. The latter are both chronic concerns in the U.S. that were exacerbated during the pandemic and continue to affect millions of Americans. Colorado, for example, received more than $30 million for such programs and Minnesota received nearly $28 million, according to health and human services agencies in those states.

In many cases, this money flowed to addiction recovery services, which go beyond traditional treatment to help people with substance use disorders rebuild their lives. These programs do things that insurers often don’t reimburse, such as driving people to medical appointments and court hearings, crafting résumés and training them for new jobs, finding them housing, and helping them build social connections unrelated to drugs.
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s cuts, allowing the programs to continue — for now — receiving federal funding. But many of the affected programs say they can’t easily rehire people they laid off or resurrect services they curtailed. And they’re unsure they can survive long-term amid an environment of uncertainty and fear, not knowing when the judge’s ruling might be lifted or another funding source cut.
The week it slashed the funding, the Trump administration also announced a massive reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services, including the consolidation of the main federal agency focused on addiction recovery services. Without a stand-alone office like the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, many advocates worry, recovery work — and the funding to support it — will no longer be a priority. Although private foundations and state governments may step in, it’s unlikely they could match the tranches of federal funding.
“Recovery support is treated as optional,” said Racquel Garcia, founder of HardBeauty, a Colorado-based addiction recovery organization.
The federal cuts put at risk a roughly $75,000 grant her team had received to care for pregnant women with substance use disorders in two rural counties in Colorado.
“It’s very easy to make sweeping decisions from the top in the name of money, when you don’t have to be the one to tell the mom, ‘We can’t show up today,’” Garcia said. “When you never have to sit in front of the mama who really needed us to be there.”
Mental health conditions, including substance use disorders, are a leading cause of maternal mortality in the U.S. And although national overdose deaths have decreased recently, rates have risen in many Black and Native American communities. Many people in the addiction field worry these funding rollbacks could reverse hard-earned progress.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard told KFF Health News that the department is reorganizing to improve efficiency, foster a more coordinated approach to addiction, and prioritize funding projects that align with the president’s Make America Healthy Again initiative.
“We aim to streamline resources and eliminate redundancies, ensuring that essential mental health and substance use disorder services are delivered more effectively,” she said in a statement.
But to Garcia, it doesn’t feel like streamlining. It feels like abandoning moms in need.
Between the time the cuts were announced and when the federal judge paused them, two women served by Garcia’s program gave birth, she said. Though her grant funding was in limbo, Garcia told her employee to show up at the bedside for both moms. The employee followed up with daily check-ins for the new moms, connected them to treatment or housing services when needed, and helped them navigate the child services system.
“I just can’t leave moms” without services, Garcia said. “I just can’t do it.”
Nor can she abandon that employee, she said. Although the federal funding provided half of that employee’s salary, Garcia has continued to keep her on full time.
Garcia said she primarily employs women in recovery, many of whom spent years trapped in abusive situations, relying on welfare benefits. Now they’re sober and have found meaningful work that allows them to provide for their families, she said. “We created our own workforce of mamas who help other mamas.”
This type of recovery workforce development seems to align with the Republican Party’s goals of getting more people to work and reducing reliance on welfare benefits. The Trump administration’s drug policy priorities, released in early April, identified creating “a skilled, recovery-ready workforce” and strengthening peer recovery support services as crucial efforts to help people “find recovery and lead productive, healthy lives.” Many recovery programs train people for blue-collar jobs, which could support Trump’s goal of reviving the manufacturing industry.
But the administration’s actions appear to conflict with its stated goals, said Rahul Gupta, the nation’s drug czar during the Biden administration.
“You can’t have manufacturing if people can’t pass a urine drug test or continue to suffer from addiction or relapse,” said Gupta, who is now president of GATC Health, a company using artificial intelligence for drug development.
Even if jobs return to rural America, cutting funding for recovery services and the main federal office overseeing such efforts could mean fewer people are employable, Gupta said.
Research on recovery programs, particularly those run by people with personal addiction experience, suggests they can increase engagement in court-ordered treatment, reduce the prevalence of rearrest, bolster attendance at treatment appointments, and improve the likelihood of families reunifying and stabilizing.
Billy O’Bryan sees these benefits daily. As a state director for the national nonprofit Young People in Recovery, O’Bryan oversees about a dozen chapters in Kentucky that teach people in recovery life skills, such as balancing a checkbook and interviewing for jobs, and show them how to have fun in sobriety, through group hikes and glow-in-the-dark Ultimate Frisbee games.
Providing recovery services “is when we really invest in their future,” said O’Bryan, who is in recovery too.
Six of his chapters were affected by the federal funding cuts. That has meant dipping into his organization’s rainy day fund to pay staff and cutting back on community events, including cleanup days in which chapter members gather used syringes off the street, pass out the overdose reversal medication naloxone, and talk to people using drugs about the possibility of recovery.
He’s exploring fundraising efforts now, but not all his chapters have the same ability.
“In a city like Louisville, fundraising is not a problem,” O’Bryan said, “but when you get out into Grayson, Kentucky” — a rural area in the Appalachian Mountains — “there’s not a lot of opportunities.”

In Minnesota, Kaleab Woldegiorgis and his colleagues at Niyyah Recovery Initiative used to spend hours a day at soup kitchens, community events, mosques, and on the streets of East African and Muslim neighborhoods, trying to connect with people using drugs. They spoke Somali, Amharic, and Swahili, among other languages.
Those outreach efforts allowed them to “find individuals in need of recovery services” who “weren’t seeking it out themselves,” said Woldegiorgis, who previously attended Niyyah’s support groups when he was dealing with addiction.
After building relationships with people, Woldegiorgis could help them connect with formal recovery services that bill their insurance, he said. But help couldn’t always wait for a contract.
One afternoon shortly before the federal funding cuts, Woldegiorgis and his colleagues spoke with a man who began weeping, recounting how he had wanted to get treatment a few days earlier but had lost his belongings, returned to using drugs, and ended up on the street. Woldegiorgis said he helped the man reconnect with a sister and begin exploring treatment options.
With the federal funding cuts, Niyyah may no longer be able to support this type of outreach work. Woldegiorgis fears it means people won’t receive the message of hope that can come from interacting with role models in recovery.
“People don’t pick up pamphlets to receive these messages. And people don’t read emails and people don’t look at billboards and find inspiration,” he said. “People need people.”

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at FEMA


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

Kennedy Jr. speaks at the Rx and Illicit Drug Summit at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 24, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s push to “Make America Healthy Again” is making some North Dakota farmers queasy. 
Kennedy’s MAHA movement shuns highly processed foods and dyes. But it also includes an attack on oils made from seeds such as sunflowers and canola, with North Dakota being a leading producer of those specialty crops.
These oils are among what has become known as the “Hateful Eight,” oils from canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, soy, rice bran, sunflower and safflower targeted by the MAHA movement. 
During a roundtable discussion last week in Fargo with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, representatives of crops such as sunflowers, canola, soybeans and lentils said the MAHA movement is troubling for their members.  
Rollins is part of a MAHA Commission, created by President Donald Trump, with Kennedy as the chair.

John Sandbakken is executive director of the National Sunflower Association, headquartered in North Dakota but representing growers around the country. He said he has heard from farmers in multiple states concerned about the Rollins’ role on the MAHA Commission, led by Kennedy. 
“There’s a lot of misinformation out on the internet about seed oils, and we are hoping, as groups, that you will be a strong advocate for seed oils and the healthy benefits that they do bring to our consumers,” Sandbakken said.
Rollins responded that Kennedy is a “unique voice.” 
“My commitment is to be a vigorous and persistent advocate for all agriculture, including the great people that you represent,” Rollins said. 
The American Heart Institute is among the groups siding with seed oils advocates that they are healthy. 
Kennedy is backing beef tallow, a cooking oil that fell out of favor for being high in saturated fat.

An oil that is low in saturated fat is canola oil.  
Tim Mickelson, a Rolla farmer who is president of the U.S. Canola Association, encouraged Rollins to “follow the science” on health and ag research.
Mickelson said he fears the anti-seed oil movement is gaining momentum among consumers, which is just one of the problems facing canola growers. 
Mickelson farms near the U.S. border with Canada, where most canola is grown. 
He said canola prices in the U.S. follow the prices on Winnipeg Commodity Exchange and prices are also affected by the Canadian dollar.

“So if you’re pushing ideas of a tariff on Canada, and it’s hitting canola, you’re going to hit the futures price negatively. You’re also going to hit the Canadian dollar negatively,” Mickelson said. “So canola is getting a double whammy.” 
He said even the rumors of tariffs hurt the canola market. “Anytime somebody would sneeze on the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange about a tariff, canola would just be plummeting down,” Mickelson said. 
He said the market fell about 20% in March as tariffs with Canada were making headlines. 
“Anything that disrupts the flow of canola between the United States and Canada is detrimental to the entire industry,” Mickelson said. 
While the canola market has rebounded, he said the tariff talk and market drop was happening as farmers were making final decisions about what to plant in the 2025 growing season. 
The United States had a record year for canola production in 2024, most of it coming from North Dakota, according to the U.S. Canola Association. There were 2.7 million acres planted to canola in 30 states last year, led by North Dakota with more than 2.1 million acres.
Mickelson said with farmers concerned about changing consumer demand for canola oil and the timing of the tariff talk, canola acres could be down by 20% this year. 
Mickelson said he was grateful that Rollins came to North Dakota. 
“I think she has very good intentions on taking what we talked about today and trying to implement the things that need to be changed,” Mickelson said, but acknowledged that she has less influence on the MAHA movement than the health secretary. 
“That’s a big challenge,” Mickelson said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/John Partipilo)The city of Nashville has sued the federal government over the abrupt halt of federal public health grants to vaccinate children, test for infectious disease, operate community clinics and conduct outreach to unhoused individuals.
The lawsuit, filed Thursday in a Washington, D.C. federal court, alleges the Centers for Disease Control and Infection (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) illegally terminated $11.4 billion in federal public health funding across the nation last month. The lawsuit claims the action usurped the authority of Congress, which appropriated the funding during the COVID era for current and future pandemic preparedness. 
The grants to Nashville and other local governments were terminated “for cause,” a term that applies to wrongdoing on the recipients’ part. The federal government, however, said the “end of the [COVID] pandemic constituted its cause.” Being terminated from a federal grant for cause can impact the ability to get new grants.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” a March HHS statement about the funding cuts quoted in the lawsuit said. “HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Health Again.”










It could delay investigation and follow up to vaccine preventable diseases, such as Hep A (Hepatitis A) and B, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), among many others, unless we find other sources of funding which could lead to increased instances and more acute cases of vaccine preventable diseases.


– Dr. Sammi Areola, Metro Nashville Pubic Health


An HHS spokesperson on Friday declined to comment further on the litigation.
Nashville joined Harris County, Texas, Columbus, Ohio, Kansas City, Missouri and the American Federation of County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO in filing the suit, which also names HHS chief Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and CDC acting director Susan Monarez. The CDC is overseen by HHS.
The lawsuit said the funding to public health departments reflected Congress’ intent to address the “longer term challenges it knew the country would face in Covid-19’s wake, including gaps in the public health system and the need for investment in critical public health infrastructure.”
Metro Nashville Public Health Director Sanmi Areola said Friday he was “concerned about the impacts of the funding losses on the health of our residents.” 
Among the Nashville health services impacted are efforts to ensure children are up-to-date on vaccines, oversight of daycare immunization compliance, providing back-to-school physicals and delays in receiving immunization records, he said. 
Areola said the cuts could lead to more acute cases of vaccine-preventable diseases.
“It could delay investigation and follow up to vaccine preventable diseases, such as Hep A (Hepatitis A) and B, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), among many others, unless we find other sources of funding which could lead to increased instances and more acute cases of vaccine preventable diseases,” Dr. Areola said via email. 
Dr. Areola said health officials are working to minimize impacts on services. 
Nashville received word March 25 that it had lost the funding effective the prior day, March 24. 
The public health department has had to cut 16 full time staff in a division that conducted health and resource barrier screenings. The public health department can also no longer move forward with six already-advertised positions to do outreach to homeless individuals, the lawsuit said.
Plans to purchase a mobile medical unit have been shelved, too.
The lawsuit is seeking the restoration of funding and a declaration that the actions by the Trump administration were unlawful. The federal government has not yet filed a formal legal response to the lawsuit, and no court dates have yet been set.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Get rid of FEMA? Trump-appointed group to look at shifting disaster response to states.

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo by Coady Media) Beyond Kentucky’s borders, horse racing is a sport in steep decline. Within the commonwealth, however, wealth is common.
Though no fewer than 48 American racetracks have closed since 2000, Kentucky operators continue to invest hundreds of millions in their facilities and are reaping an outsized return, and not only on the first Saturday in May. 
For instance:
Churchill Downs Inc. reported record net revenue ($2.7 billion) and net income ($427 million) for 2024. 
Keeneland’s September Yearling Sale netted a record $427.9 million. 
The 2006 races run in Kentucky in 2024 paid an average purse of $112,648, 20% higher than the second most lucrative state (Arkansas). 
September’s seven-day all-grass meet at Kentucky Downs in Franklin paid out $490,789 per race, easily the highest total ever recorded at a North American track. 
“Retreat to Kentucky if you want a future in racing,” California horseplayer Andy Asaro tweeted on April 15. “Things are moving fast.”

Beyond the Bluegrass, things are moving mostly in reverse. Jockey Club data shows the number of Thoroughbred races run in the United States has dropped by more than 50% since 1995, and the size of the national foal crop has been falling even faster, from 34,358 in 2007 to an estimated 16,675 last year. The Sonoma County Fair recently announced it will forego live racing for the first time since 1936 because of a shrinking supply of horses in Northern California. Last month, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled the state’s historical horse racing machines unconstitutional, prompting Churchill Downs Inc. to project a 25% cut in purses at its Fair Grounds racetrack.
Slots-lite a double-edged sword 
Meanwhile, “decoupling” legislation that could free Florida gaming operators of the obligation to stage live racing as a condition of their licenses has been stalled, but may only represent a temporary reprieve from redevelopment of major tracks. The Stronach Group’s 1/ST Racing, which owns Gulfstream and Santa Anita, has threatened to sell both tracks while showing a pronounced inclination to divest rather than invest in its properties. Last year, the company closed Golden Gate Fields near San Francisco and cut a deal that turned over Baltimore’s Pimlico, the home of the Preakness Stakes, to the state of Maryland. 
Against this gloomy backdrop, and in contrast to its own contentious closure of Arlington Park near Chicago, Churchill Downs Inc. continues to spend aggressively on its flagship track. Plans for new capital projects with a projected cost of $920 million were put on pause last Wednesday, ostensibly in response to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and trade disputes,  but recent improvements to the paddock and the addition of Homestretch Club and Turn One Experience cost in excess of $300 million and speak to management’s long-term bullishness. 
While these investments are largely attributable to the singular appeal of the Kentucky Derby, they also reflect the thoroughbred industry’s political influence in Frankfort and, in turn, the gushing revenue stream historical horse racing (HHR) terminals have unleashed. 
Since their 2011 introduction at Kentucky Downs, the slot-like historical horse racing terminals have reinvigorated racing in the state. Programmed to pay out based on the results of races previously run, Kentucky’s HHR machines generated more than $9.6 billion in handle during the 2024 fiscal year, accounting for $99 in bets for every $1 wagered live at the state’s thoroughbred and standardbred tracks. 
They contributed $55.5 million to Kentucky’s Thoroughbred Development Fund during that 12-month period, fueling the growth of purses that have more than doubled since 2017. Consequently, Eric Hamelback, CEO of the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, refers to HHR’s proliferation as racing’s “golden ticket.”

When HHR’s legality was challenged in 2018, Ellis Park General Manager Jeffery Inman said the loss of that revenue would “likely threaten the very survival of one of Kentucky’s iconic racing venues.” Though opposition was vocal, it was handily outvoted. Attorney Ryan Roark, in an article published in the Kentucky Law Journal, wrote that the legislature settled on a definition of pari-mutuel wagering “not shared by anyone outside Kentucky … to allow for the powerful horse industry to exclusively run their slot-like gaming systems.” 
The result, says Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen, has been a “juggernaut.” According to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, gross HHR commissions for Churchill Downs’ two Derby City Gaming locations exceeded $224 million for the 2024 fiscal year, nearly 12 times the total commissions from on-track wagering at all of the state’s racetracks. 
To the extent this disparity underscores the industry’s reliance on revenue sources that require no physical horses, it inevitably raises questions about racing’s sustainability and the best use of its real estate.

“Racing is on life support in Southern California, Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania etc. and exists almost everywhere else only with the support of non-racing revenues from slots, casinos and state supplements,” Kenwood Racing founder H. Robb Levinsky wrote in a January letter to Thoroughbred Daily News. “Instead of embracing innovative ideas to make the sport more attractive to a new generation of racing fans and owners, the focus continues to be on protecting those non-racing revenues. An industry where 80-90% of purse money comes from slots instead of wagering on the core product is simply not viable in the long run.”
Signs of progress in New York, Maryland
In the short run, at least, the growth of Kentucky’s purses has led to a higher quality of horses competing in the state, more interest among bettors and a breeding boom running contrary to national trends. As Ed DeRosa documented for Horse Racing Nation, Kentucky passed both California and Florida in total handle in 2024 after trailing both states annually since 2007. 
“We’re the only jurisdiction (among the top four states) that has grown since 2020,” said Chauncey Morris, executive director of the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association. “The rest have contracted.”
And as cash incentives for Kentucky-breds have increased, so has the state’s share of registered foals. When HHR was introduced at Kentucky Downs in 2011, Kentucky produced 29.2% of the national foal crop. In 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available, it was 42.2%.   
  Damon Thayer (LRC Public Information)
“In states where racing has a good relationship with state legislators, racing is in good shape,” said consultant Damon Thayer, formerly the Kentucky Senate’s majority floor leader. “In states where they have not cultivated a long-term relationship with the legislature, horse racing is either in a declining state, a crisis state or a questionable state.”
In addition to Kentucky, there are pockets of progress. New York and Maryland have committed nearly a billion dollars to renovations at Belmont Park and Pimlico. Multiple industry executives cited developments in Wyoming, the nation’s last populous state, as a basis for bullishness. Yet their optimism is tempered by unsolved problems in larger locales, including the most populous state, California. 
Without supplemental income from other forms of gambling, California’s racing and breeding businesses have been contracting for decades. Efforts to enhance purses through HHR remain at the discussion stage in view of Native American tribes’ virtual monopoly on the state’s casino gaming. Unless some accommodation can be reached, racing columnist Ray Paulick warns, “racing in California is history.”
“You can put 1,000 HHRs in at Santa Anita and it would change California racing overnight,” Thayer said. “They’d be wildly popular. You’d direct the money to purses and breeders reward programs and it would be a huge success. It seems like some sort of attempt should be made to cut a deal with the Indians and convince them that 1,000 HHRs at Santa Anita is not going to damage their land-based casinos. . .
“Like Cyndi Lauper used to say, money changes everything.”

(Ben Wasserstein)In a parking lot across from the governor’s residence filled with construction trucks and contractor vans, a crowd of around 200 gathered and listened to prayers, songs and speeches from members of different faiths — Jewish, Christian, Sufi and Baha’i. They had marched nearly a mile from Temple Beth El, a conservative synagogue on the Susquehanna River, for a vigil organized by the Jewish Federation of Greater Harrisburg.
Only days earlier, Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family were evacuated from the residence just before 2 a.m., hours after their Seder celebrating the first night of Passover. Someone had thrown Molotov cocktails into the room downstairs that was prepared for their next Seder, engulfing it in flames.
“We say in our Seder ‘Let all who are hungry come and eat’ and we open the door,” Rabbi Melody Davis, one of the attendees, told the Capital-Star. She added the attack evoked a history of pogroms against Jewish people on the Passover holiday. 
“For this to happen, [it] affects all of us,” she said.

Details of what happened in the early morning hours of April 13 trickled out over the following few days. A man, Cody Balmer of Harrisburg, was arrested after turning himself in to state police. Images of the destruction — a burnt Haggadah, a Jewish prayer book recited at Passover Seders, melted tables and blackened plates — were shown in news stories about the incident around the world
Balmer told authorities he would have attacked Shapiro with a hammer had he come across him, and acted because he did not want to “take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.”
It is not known if Balmer targeted Shapiro explicitly because of his Jewish faith, or intentionally acted on Passover, but the circumstances of the attack, the images that have emerged, and what is publicly known of his motive have raised fears in Pennsylvania’s Jewish community at a time when many already already feel vulnerable.
Since the beginning of the conflict in Gaza that began with Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the emergence of a protest movement opposing Israel’s campaign that’s estimated to have killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, debates over what constitutes antisemitism and how institutions and governments should respond have been thrust into the center of American politics. And the Trump administration has used the specter of antisemitism to justify some of its most divisive policies.
In the state that bore witness to the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history in 2018 at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the spotlight on Jews has left many feeling vulnerable. That sense was exacerbated following the attack on Pennsylvania’s highest-ranking Jewish official.
“A lot of the conversations I’ve been having are with people saying, ‘This is our worst fear confirmed,’” said Laura Cherner, the director of the community relations council at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. 
Cherner’s job, as she describes it, involves keeping a finger on the pulse of how Jews are responding to a reported rise in antisemitism incidents that accelerated following the outbreak of war in Gaza. Since the attack on Shapiro, Cherner has received dozens of calls.
“Often, Jews feel like a political football,” she added. “I think, ultimately, many feel like this is almost a confirmation of what we’ve been talking about. We’ve been trying to raise awareness and screaming from the rooftops of the increase in antisemitism.”

Urging caution
The state’s Jewish community has different views on whether the attack on Shapiro can be called antisemitic, but the imagery that emerged from it left an indelible mark.
“I don’t know a single Jewish family that wasn’t talking about it on the second night Seder,” said Andrew Goretsky, regional director for the ADL-Philadelphia. “What happened at Governor Shapiro’s residence, this has an impact,” 
For the members of the Tree of Life congregation in Pittsburgh, the photos from earlier this month of the burnt room triggered memories from the 2018 mass shooting that killed 11 people. 
“We’ve been in that room. Some of us have been there multiple times,” said Alan Hausman, the president of the Tree of Life Congregation, referring to the reception room in the governor’s residence. “No matter what the motivation is, it’s a difficult thing to look at.”
Following news of the attack, members of the congregation began writing a letter to express solidarity and support for Shapiro. But drafting it proved difficult, and Hausman had concerns with an early iteration.
Initially, he said, it focused too much on the circumstances and timing of the attack on Passover.
“I don’t think that’s important,” Hausman said. “What’s important is to tell him, ‘We’re here. We’re gonna help you get through this. We’re going to help you rebuild.’”
It’s part of a broader message he wants to get across: Don’t jump to conclusions about Balmer’s motive when so much remains unclear.
“There are people that immediately go to, ‘This is 100% antisemitic,’” Hausman said. “But we want to caution against that.”
Members of Hausman’s synagogue know better than most what an investigation into an attacker’s motivation can look like, and how to sit with both the knowns and unknowns. And Hausman worries that prematurely ascribing an antisemitic motive to the attack could cause undue panic and fear.
Shapiro has urged similar caution, refusing in interviews and press conferences to weigh in on whether Balmer should be charged with a hate crime until investigations play out.
But not all Jewish faith leaders share that perspective.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At a synagogue only a mile-and-a-half from Tree of Life, Rabbi Daniel Fellman wrestled with the same questions over how to address the matter with his congregation.
He first heard about the arson attack when he got an alert on his smart watch during a service on the first morning of Passover. During that day’s prayer for healing, he said words for Shapiro and his family, and left it at that
But as more details emerged, he felt the timing of the attack, and the decision to target a vocally Jewish elected leader over an international conflict he has no control over, led to a clear conclusion.
So on the Friday after the attack, Fellman dedicated the majority of his sermon to calling out what he saw as an explicitly antisemitic attack.
“If you ask me personally, if Governor Shapiro was a good Lutheran, that firebombing wouldn’t have occurred in Harrisburg at the governor’s (residence). It just wouldn’t have happened, and we have to acknowledge that,” Fellman said. “People need to understand that was an attack not just on the governor and his family, but an attack on all of us here. And it was certainly an attack on the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

‘Outside Pressures’
For Fellman, the violence can’t be viewed in a vacuum. 
Since Hamas attacked Israel in the fall of 2023, and Israel responded by waging a war on occupied Gaza that has killed tens of thousands, Fellman has felt a need to speak out, including criticizing what he saw as Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians.
His congregation includes both fierce critics and defenders of Israel. Most, he noted, are somewhere in the middle, which he defines roughly as believing in the country’s right to exist, while disagreeing with many of its actions. He is encouraging dialogue, even teaching a class on modern Israel that addresses history and politics.
“Jews are raised and nurtured on arguing for the sake of Heaven. We believe in discussion. We believe in debate,” Fellman said. “The difference here is the outside pressures that this has released … That has made this much more complicated for the folks in my community.”
Those outside pressures, he said, include people who he sees as conflating the actions of the state of Israel with a reflection of the desires of the Jewish community writ large.
Fellman, who describes himself as a moderate, says he sees that in the actions of pro-Palestinian protesters who have targeted Jewish students and businesses. And he sees it on the political right, where politicians have cheered on the punishment and deportation of critics of Israel in the name of opposing antisemitism.
“I think for most American Jews, we’re feeling the confusion and the unsettledness of it all,” Fellman said. “And the governor’s mansion being firebombed is just adding to that.”

‘Red herring’
In its 2024 audit, the Anti-Defamation League noted that around half of the more than 5,000 anti-Israel rallies contained antisemitic rhetoric. The ADL included justification of antisemitic violence, equating Judaism with Nazism and celebration of the October 7 attacks as antisemitic rhetoric or activity.
The ADL has been under scrutiny after its CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, made comments conflating anti-zionism and antisemitism. But the group said its audit conforms with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which includes holding the Jewish people as a whole accountable for the actions of the Israeli government.

Ten days into his second term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order taking steps to combat antisemitism.
But for some Jewish people, those bring their own concerns.

Sen. Judy Schwank (D-Berks), co-chair of the Pennsylvania Jewish Legislative Caucus,  worries about what these measures will mean for the Jewish people in the future.
“Are we going to face the brunt of the anger of people about what the administration is doing?” she said.
Since the executive order, the federal government has arrested students who spoke out against Israel on the grounds that they were participating in antisemitic activities or even endorsing terrorism. 

This includes Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University student from Turkey who was in the U.S. on a visa. Her apparent crime was co-writing an 2024 op-ed in her student newspaper urging her school to divest from companies with ties to Israel. 
Öztürk was approached and arrested by six plainclothes federal agents on a street near her home in Massachusetts and placed in an unmarked car.  Now, she’s in a detention center in Louisiana fighting her potential deportation in court. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said that Öztürk engaged in activities supporting Hamas, the militant group that governs the Gaza strip and is deemed a terrorist organization by the U.S.. But an internal memo from the U.S. Department of State, reported by the Washington Post, said they found no evidence linking her to Hamas or engaging in antisemitic activities.

Security camera footage of Öztürk’s arrest went viral, and became a rallying call for critics of the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to snatch and deport student visa holders for their roles in anti-Israel protests.
“I believe that agents within the federal government representing the Trump administration are calling out antisemitism, but it’s really just a red herring, an excuse to forcibly and maybe illegally remove people from this country,” Schwank said.
Following multiple lawsuits, the Trump administration reversed course and restored thousands of revoked student visas, but a federal lawyer told one judge that U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement is developing a policy for future revocations.
Rabbi Linda Holtzman, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace, argued that reports of antisemitism at pro-Palestinian protests have been drastically overemphasized, and that the narrative is being used to punish those protesting.
“What’s clear to me is that the Trump administration uses antisemitism in order to punish Palestinian rights activists who are trying to stop a United States-backed genocide … that’s where I see antisemitism being used in a way that’s illegitimate and inappropriate,” she said.
She worries that what she believes are false accusations of antisemitism obscure people’s ability to address legitimate concerns. 
Jonathan Goldman, chair of the Pennsylvania Jewish Coalition, does see a link between anti-Israel protests and rising reports of antisemitism.
“I believe it’s intellectually possible to have views that are anti-Israel — anti the state of Israel — and not be antisemitic,” Goldman said. “But man, is that slice of cake thin.”
Still, he opposes policies punishing foreign students who participated in protests without offering them due process, and of threatening universities where protests took place.
For him, the images of Öztürk’s arrest, and the crackdown on perceived political enemies more broadly, evoke darker times of Jewish history.
“I watched that video before bed, and then I watched it again the next day,” Goldman said. “Those are not Jewish Values … Historically speaking, Jews do well where a society is more free and democratic politically.”
But Goldman has spoken to some Jewish people who support the administration’s efforts to combat alleged antisemitism, but as he sees it, those tools can be turned on other perceived enemies.
“The Jewish institutions are scared, even the ones I’m representing,” Goldman said.
“What’s happening in the broader political environment is insane, and it’s affecting the way people are feeling with regard to this firebombing and the way people are acting and speaking with regard to it.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)No one complained when state regulators quietly allowed hemp-derived THC beverages to be sold in Rhode Island’s liquor stores late last summer. 
But now that state lawmakers are considering codifying the rules, the state’s cannabis cultivators and retailers are speaking out, saying the liquor industry is circumventing stringent guidelines they’ve had to follow to get their psychoactive products to market
A bill sponsored by Rep. Jacquelyn Baginski, a Cranston Democrat, would declare it legal for licensed distributors to sell beverages containing up to 5mg of delta-9 THC at liquor stores, bars, and restaurants. The bill would also increase the fee liquor wholesalers pay for the right to sell these products. Companion legislation is sponsored in the Senate by Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat.
“The goal of my legislation is to get our arms around the sale of beverages that are already being sold,” Baginski said in an interview. “For every good actor and retailer who goes out and goes through the trouble of requiring that license, there are potentially one or two who have not done that.’”
Existing hemp rules allow the sale of delta-9 THC products such as gummies, lozenges, packaged baked goods, and beverages at licensed retailers. The state now has 120 hemp retailers and distributors, which include businesses headquartered in Colorado, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. 
Connecticut last July mandated THC-infused drinks only be available at state-licensed liquor stores and cannabis retailers. Massachusetts regulators, meanwhile, declared last May that intoxicating hemp-based products cannot be sold outside of cannabis retail stores.
Under Baginski’s and Britto’s bills, the annual fee paid by liquor wholesalers would increase from $500 to $1,500 to distribute delta-9 THC drinks under rules crafted by the state’s Department of Business Regulation. Bars and restaurants would have to pay $250 a year. 
Rhode Island’s seven cannabis dispensaries, meanwhile, pay a yearly $30,000 licensing fee to sell THC products. Those rules are based on regulations crafted by the state’s Cannabis Control Commission.
“Why is one held to all this high regulation, while the other is not?” Magnus Thorsson, a professor at Johnson & Wales University’s Cannabis Entrepreneurship Program, told Rhode Island Current. “It’s not fair and balanced.”
Mike Simpson, co-founder of Lovewell farms in Hopkinton, said he’s fine with liquor stores being allowed to sell hemp products in Rhode Island. He just wishes that hemp growers like himself had a say in the initial legislation.
“They completely left out the existing hemp industry, as if we don’t exist,” Simpson said in an interview Thursday. “This kind of not only feels superfluous, but also feels like they didn’t actually engage with the industry — I hope they’re open to hearing.”
Baginski acknowledged that she has not met with hemp industry leaders but said she is always willing to connect with them.
“I don’t claim to know everything, and I am happy to take all the feedback out there for me to absorb,” she said. 
Baginiski’s bill received its initial hearing before the House Corporations Committee on April 8, where it was held for further study as is standard practice during a first vetting by a legislative panel.
The state’s liquor industry is backing the proposal.










Why is one held to all this high regulation, while the other is not? It’s not fair and balanced.


–  Magnus Thorsson, a professor at Johnson & Wales University’s Cannabis Entrepreneurship Program


Rhode Island Liquor Operators Collaborative Executive Director Nicholas Fede Jr. said alcohol retailers are well-positioned to be part of the hemp-derived THC market. He told Rhode Island Current that store owners and staff are already trained to recognize the effects of intoxicating substances when interacting with customers.
“We have a long history of high product integrity,” Fede said. “We are the gatekeepers for public safety.”
Alex Nendza, director of marketing for Bottles Fine Wine on Providence’s East Side, understands the sense of resentment coming from cannabis dispensaries and cultivators but said he believes having more retail outlets will help the industry grow.
THC drinks already account for 10% of Bottles’ revenue. 
“It’s difficult to keep them in stock at times,” Nendza said in an interview. “Our shelves empty out pretty fast.”
Getting THC from CBD
Hemp has been legal at the federal level since 2018. Hemp-derived THC drinks were technically illegal in Rhode Island — at least until last August when the state’s Office of Cannabis Regulation began allowing the sale of products containing low levels of delta-9 THC at licensed retailers, which includes vape shops and liquor stores.
Beverages derived from cannabis continue to only be sold at licensed cannabis retailers. Hemp by itself produces little to no THC content and is typically non-psychoactive when first harvested, unlike other cannabis plants.
“It’s a molecule, and your body doesn’t make any discretion at all to where it comes from,” Stuart Procter, co-founder and lab director for cannabis testing facility PureVita Labs in West Warwick, said
The main difference is how the psychoactive compound is derived. 
Delta-9 is a naturally-occurring cannabinoid within cannabis plants. With hemp, it takes a little chemical magic to convert non-psychoactive CBD into THC. Methods include soaking the hemp material in a liquid like butane or ethanol, applying enough pressure and heat to extract THC compounds, or exposing the plant to acid.
“If all of the processes are done properly by chemists and people who know what they’re doing, you probably end up with a nice safe product which is absolutely identical to the delta-9 taken from marijuana plants,” said Procter, who chairs the Cannabis Advisory Board’s Public Health Subcommittee.
But because hemp testing rules vary from state to state, Procter said safety isn’t always guaranteed.
“There are very limited to no testing standards guiding hemp-related products,” he said. “If you were to bring hemp into the same regulatory protocols that would make sense — if they want to play in the same market, they should abide by the same regulations.”

Conflicting rules?
During the bill’s April 8 hearing, Baginski told lawmakers she was surprised to see hemp-based THC products available on the marketplace “and largely sold unregulated.”
“The intent of this legislation is not to make any changes to the existing structure of sales of marijuana-based THC, but to create a new safe marketplace for hemp THC beverages.”
But state regulators argue Baginski’s proposal could conflict with existing cannabis rules. 
Cannabis Control Commission Chairperson Kimberly Ahern wrote to the committee that the existing bill would revoke several existing hemp licenses and contradicts the state’s commitment to “building a robust cannabis economy.”
Hemp-derived THC products under Baginski’s bill would not be subject to the same testing, labeling restrictions, and additional safety protocols required under existing rules and upcoming regulations required for recreational cannabis.
“The absence of clear requirements for psychoactive hemp-derived products increases the risk of accidental overconsumption and potential exposure to vulnerable populations, including youth,” Ahern warned.
Ahern asked that the General Assembly hold the bill until regulators and industry leaders could discuss “alignment with the state’s broader cannabis and hemp regulatory strategy.”
Baginski said she’s open to making any necessary changes to the bill to ensure it aligns with existing regulations, adding that the goal of any legislation is to spark conversation and let the democratic process unfold.
“I do think it’s worth having a conversation about who we’re selling these things to and what exactly they are,” she told Rhode Island Current.

ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.



FEMA denies assistance to some KY counties affected by February floods

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says the state will appeal FEMA’s denial last week of assistance to some Kentucky counties affected by flooding in February.
The agency determined the severity and magnitude in those counties did not warrant assistance, says a letter from an acting assistant administrator in the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FEMA denied public assistance for the February flooding to local governments in Simpson and Woodford counties, and individual assistance to six counties: Butler, Franklin, Knox, Laurel, Lawrence and Whitley.
In a news release, Beshear said 68 counties have been approved for public assistance and 16 counties for assistance to individuals. 
Meanwhile, Beshear announced that President Donald Trump has approved part of Kentucky’s April 11 request for a major disaster declaration stemming, which includes individual assistance for Kentuckians in 13 of the counties affected by the most recent flooding. 
The state’s requests for public assistance for 33 counties and hazard mitigation for the entire state are still pending.
Individual assistance has been approved for Anderson, Butler, Carroll, Christian, Clark, Franklin, Hardin, Hopkins, Jessamine, McCracken, Mercer, Owen and Woodford counties. The governor will request that additional counties be added to the declaration through an amendment once ongoing assessments are complete. 


“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Beshear says dismantling FEMA would be ‘disastrous’ though improvements need to continue

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
Some Kentucky Republicans echo Trump’s complaints about FEMA after latest flood

But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)As she briefed contractors about their upcoming bids to rebuild housing in western North Carolina last week, a state official laid out a candid assessment of the mission ahead.
“We need you, desperately, to build those homes and get people home,” said Angie Dunaway, the director of contracting for the NC Department of Commerce’s new team leading Hurricane Helene recovery efforts.
In early May, the state will begin fielding offers from companies to demolish, repair and rebuild homes destroyed by the deadliest storm in North Carolina history.
It is a monumental task in both scope and logistics. The western mountains will require “some special type of building,” Dunaway told contractors. And the capital involved will be immense — including more than $1.4 billion in federal money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
At every turn, the process will be closely scrutinized. Mismanagement and accounting errors plagued the state’s home rebuilding program after Hurricanes Matthew and Florence. Years later, some of those homes are still incomplete. Furious state lawmakers have made it clear they have little patience this time around.
Gov. Josh Stein has taken a different route than his predecessor, former Gov. Roy Cooper, and spun up new teams to spearhead recovery for Helene. He and his top lieutenants have said they intend for those teams to be smaller and leaner — making private sector contracts all the more critical.
When contractors are selected and get to work, day-to-day operations will look different than they have in the east. State officials do not intend to pay to put up survivors in hotels except in “extreme” circumstances; newly-built homes will follow strict floor plans and timelines; and every interaction between homeowners and builders must be thoroughly documented.
HUD approved the state’s plan to spend its $1.4 billion on Friday — taking another step toward repairing and rebuilding more than 73,000 total damaged homes, and around 8,800 that are significantly damaged or totally destroyed.

Jonathan Krebs, Stein’s advisory for western North Carolina, told contractors they are aiming to be “swinging hammers at the first homes in July.”
State is leaning on contractors for rebuild. Here’s what they’re asking of them
Instead of hiring dozens of new state workers to oversee rebuilding efforts, Stein’s administration is bringing on a contractor to manage the day-to-day operations.
Bidding has been open for that role, referred to as the “implementation vendor,” since mid-April. That company, once selected, will open intake centers, identify projects and source them out to construction vendors.
State officials are aiming to contract around 25 companies for home demolition, repair and rebuild (hundreds of bids are expected). Those contracts will be for at least three years, but up to six, with one-year renewal options.
The constructors must be licensed in North Carolina, and will be selected based on a wide swath of criteria — but foremost, their ability to do “quality work, fast.”
“We want you out there building homes, as quickly as possible,” Dunaway told contractors.
Companies will indicate which types of projects they want to handle — new builds or repairs. They’ll be paid, through the state’s management vendor, based on a project’s phases being completed. Dunaway said it was the state’s intent “that all vendors will be paid the same thing for each project.”
After the contractor receives a “notice to proceed” — an OK to begin construction — they will have up to 150 days to complete the project. Unless they receive a state-approved delay, they’ll be charged $100 per day they go over that deadline. The deadline for each project will depend on its scale: some could include repairs to private roads or bridges on the property, which the state is also contracting for separately.
Newly-built homes will have a two-year warranty. The state needs companies to document that they’re financially sound to ensure they’re around for the duration of that warranty.
In eastern North Carolina, rebuilding dragged on in part because of customizable homes with various layouts. That won’t be an option for homeowners this time. The state is planning to have a limited set of layouts — two-, three- and four-bedroom floor plans, all with two bathrooms — that will be provided by contractors and reused throughout the program.
The administration is also doing away with long-term hotel stays that racked up costs and infuriated legislators during rebuild efforts in the east.
“Unlike previous programs, we are expecting the homeowners to figure it out in most instances,” Krebs told contractors. “Not every homeowner in every instance is going to be relocated at the state’s expense.”
Relocation will happen as a “last resort” and only in “extreme” circumstances.
The state is also requiring construction vendors to have office space on-site in western North Carolina. Dunaway cited state lawmakers’ request that there be a “visual presence” in the region.
“Some of my kinfolk even complained about y’all’s accent,” Rep. Karl Gillespie (R-Cherokee) told state officials in January, as he relayed frustrations from locals about Raleigh. “But if you’re on the ground, we’ll make allowances for your accent.”
The state wants contractors to be able to hold in-person meetings with homeowners if needed, and to thoroughly document every interaction with them. The managing company will plan to set up three offices across 39 counties — and all contractors are expected to provide “extraordinary customer service.”
“When you engage with those applicants, those homeowners, we are looking for it to be positive,” Dunaway said.
FEMA denied North Carolina’s request for permanent housing earlier this year
Earlier this year, North Carolina sought another avenue for rebuilding homes in the mountains — FEMA.
The agency’s housing assistance program offers permanent repairs or new construction for households after disasters, depending on specific circumstances and eligibility. North Carolina applied for that construction, but the request was denied by FEMA.
“[Permanent housing construction] would not be an appropriate form of direct housing as alternative housing options in North Carolina exist,” FEMA disaster recovery manager Brett Howard wrote in an internal memo sent to administrators Feb. 26 and obtained by NC Newsline.
FEMA identified 269 North Carolina homeowners eligible for direct housing assistance as of late February, according to the memo. Twenty-seven of those homeowners would have been eligible for permanent housing aid, but the agency found 85 available resources, including 47 FEMA-contracted properties, that the homeowners could use.

Stein’s communications director, Kate Frauenfelder, confirmed that the governor’s office had requested the program in January. FEMA told them they no longer had the authority to issue permanent housing construction “except in extreme circumstances.”
As of April 22, 5,298 North Carolina households are receiving rental assistance, according to joint state and federal data. Another 216 are in mobile homes or trailers; 31 are in FEMA-leased properties, and 18 are in hotels or transitional shelter.
FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on its denial of the program, which has not been previously reported. In a news release last week, the agency touted its grants sent to North Carolina and its communities since January.
The agency recently denied a request from the state to extend its 100% reimbursement rate for debris removal and emergency services. Those rates now stand at 90%.

Community connection can also make a difference by reducing stress, isolation and feelings of judgment or shame. (Getty Images)In a moment, so much can change in a family’s life. 
A last-minute work schedule change that leads to relying on an unsafe babysitter. An unsupportive reaction from a bystander that could have been a connection point for support and kindness rather than further shame and frustration. A busy morning with medications left unattended and the toddler reaches up on the counter. A job loss that led to a relapse for a parent who struggles with substance use. 
Or a knock on the door from child protective services following up on an accusation of maltreatment.
Kentucky families face these real-life moments every day. And, the reality is, that last-minute change, that split-second decision, that dismissive reaction can be the key to safety or harm.
The latest national Child Maltreatment report cites that Kentucky has nearly double the national rate of child victims of maltreatment, with babies and young children remaining as the most vulnerable. It’s our tendency to think of those tragic child abuse cases featured on the news — but, when you further break down the numbers, over half of those substantiated cases were categorized as neglect. 
These families face substance misuse, domestic violence and economic stressors – all leading to deepened parental stress, mental health concerns and unstable living conditions. 
Kentucky’s Child Fatality and Near Fatality External Review Panel’s latest report further extrapolates the state of child safety. The most common cause of child deaths or near deaths in Kentucky: neglect due to access to deadly means or supervisory neglect, such as unsafe storage of firearms or of medications or illicit substances that then led to a tragedy. 
In nearly three-quarters of the cases reviewed, the family faced financial issues, and over half had substance misuse present in the home and two-thirds had a history of DCBS involvement. 
As business and faith leaders, elected officials, health providers, educators and just as good neighbors, we can play a role in supporting families in those moments of need and in all of those moments that lead to it.
What does that look like in practice? 
Most clearly, direct support, such as food and child care assistance, are proven to make a big difference in promoting well-being. When a family’s basic needs are met, parental stress goes down and child safety goes up — bottom line. 
If we know this and have a commitment to preventing child maltreatment in Kentucky, we must not jeopardize access to these critical supports for working parents struggling to make ends meet while juggling child rearing. For example, support in accessing safe child care is a “moment” that can prevent an incident of preventable abuse with an unsafe babysitter.
Next, when looking at the child maltreatment and fatality data, we can pull out some key moments in which a family is most vulnerable to their stress and frustration going too far — mainly in those critical first years of a child’s life. 
Babies are most likely to be victims, so let’s better equip new parents with tips on sleep safety and how to soothe a crying baby. Potty training can be a frustrating moment (or many, many moments) for parents and their toddler — let’s promote best practices in achieving that milestone. The HANDS home-visiting program and other voluntary parenting education courses can be a helping hand for parents to strengthen their skills and knowledge on developmentally appropriate expectations for their young children. 
Finally, when faced with challenging moments or even in those moments of joy that should be celebrated, community connection can make the world of difference in a family’s well-being. Parenting is tough, but everyday connections can reduce stress, isolation and feelings of judgment or shame. 
Connection is a small investment in time that can have a big impact. Consider helping a parent with their hands full of groceries and buckling seatbelts by returning their cart to the corral. Try sharing words of encouragement, not advice, to a parent at a park who is keeping their patience as their toddler tantrums. 
A simple “you’ve got this” to a parent can turn a stressful moment into a moment of connection and relief. 
As Child Abuse Prevention Month comes to a close, the Kosair for Kids Face It Movement encourages each of us to find those moments to offer support and connection so when those tough moments arise, families have resources, skills and community to lean on. 
Imagine how that can change a family’s life.

(Photo courtesy of Virginia DMV)Come May 7, your old Virginia driver’s license might not get you past airport security.
That’s the day the federal government will begin enforcing the long-delayed Real ID Act, requiring all domestic air travelers who use a driver’s license at TSA checkpoints to present a Real ID-compliant credential — or be turned away. If you don’t have one, and you’re planning to fly after that date, it’s time to act.
The Real ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 in response to the 9/11 Commission’s call for tougher security standards on state-issued identification. Its goal is to prevent terrorists from using fake or low-security IDs to board planes or access sensitive government facilities. 
Initially, states were supposed to comply within three years. But privacy concerns, funding issues and political resistance caused years of delays. Even after all 50 states and Washington, D.C. became compliant by 2020, the Department of Homeland Security pushed back full enforcement — most recently citing a pandemic-era backlog of applications at state DMV offices.
Now, after multiple extensions, the Transportation Security Administration has set May 7, 2025, as the final deadline.
“With summer travel just around the corner, I would encourage all Virginians to take a quick look at their driver’s licenses and check for that star on the right-hand side,” U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in an email. 
“The government has been clear that folks will need a compliant license to board an airline or enter a federal facility, so don’t delay – apply for a Real ID today.”
 Virginia: A mixed bag

While more than 4.1 million Virginians have already gotten a Real ID as of early April, that still leaves over 40% of license and ID holders in the commonwealth without one, according to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles. 
In contrast, nearby states like Maryland and the District of Columbia boast a 99% Real ID compliance rate — among the highest in the nation, Axios reported earlier this month.
Virginia DMV officials say demand has surged in recent months, with thousands of Real IDs being issued each week. But they also warn that appointments and service centers are busier than usual, and that anyone considering travel after the enforcement deadline should not wait.
“Are you flying soon? You still have time to get your REAL ID!” the agency said in a recent social media post. 
 What it means — and doesn’t

Real ID is optional in Virginia. You’re not required to have one to drive, vote, or access public benefits. But starting May 7, it will be mandatory for boarding domestic flights and entering certain federal buildings, unless you have another form of federally accepted ID, like a passport, military ID, or DHS Trusted Traveler card.
That includes military bases, which may already be rejecting licenses marked with “Federal limits apply.” Requirements vary by installation, and base visitors are encouraged to confirm what ID is accepted before showing up.
Children under 18 don’t need ID when flying domestically with an adult, but adults without a compliant license or alternative ID won’t make it past TSA.
 Getting your Real ID

The process starts online, but you’ll need to visit a DMV customer service center in person to finish the job. The fee is $10 if you’re upgrading before your license expires.
You’ll need to bring original documents — no copies allowed — proving your identity and legal presence in the U.S. That could be a birth certificate or a valid passport. You also need your full Social Security number, either on a Social Security card or a W-2 form, and two documents proving your current Virginia residency. These can include a mortgage statement, utility bill, or rental agreement.
If your legal name differs from the one on your identity documents — due to marriage or divorce, for instance — you’ll also need to bring an official name change document, such as a marriage certificate or divorce decree.
DMV officials urge residents to check their current license’s expiration date. You can renew up to one year in advance, and if your license doesn’t expire for several years, you can still come in to get a Real ID replacement.
 Why the long wait?

The Real ID rollout has taken nearly two decades to reach full enforcement. Initially set to take effect in 2008, it faced pushback over cost, state-federal tensions and fears of government overreach. 
Later, the COVID-19 pandemic created long delays and service interruptions at DMVs across the country, causing a backlog that the Department of Homeland Security cited when it postponed the May 2023 deadline to 2025.
Real ID-compliant licenses and IDs are marked with a star in the upper right-hand corner — the visual cue TSA officers will be checking for starting this spring.
 Don’t panic, but don’t delay

Travelers who don’t have a Real ID can still use a valid passport, U.S. military ID, permanent resident card, or other federally approved form of ID. A full list is available on the Virginia DMV’s Real ID FAQ page.
But DMV officials stress that getting a Real ID is the most straightforward solution for anyone who flies domestically and wants to avoid last-minute surprises at the airport.
So if you’re planning to board a plane after May 7 and your current driver’s license isn’t Real ID-compliant, the time to fix that is now. Otherwise, you may find yourself grounded — before you even get through security.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)With the 69th North Dakota Legislative Assembly finishing its business in the coming days, lawmakers elected members to the Legislative Management Committee to prepare for the next session and deal with any unfinished business.
The Legislative Management Committee has three primary roles during the interim before the 70th Legislative Assembly meets in January 2027. 
The committee decides which studies will be completed before the next legislative session and assigns them to the appropriate committees. They will appoint lawmakers to at least eight mandatory interim committees and additional committees, such as the committee tasked with being the North Dakota version of the Department of Government Efficiency, that were approved during the session. Lastly, the committee will accept the reports compiled during the interim.
John Bjornson, director of the Legislative Council, said up to 60 discretionary legislative studies and up to 15 mandatory studies are approved during each legislative session, and it will be up to the committee to whittle that down to a more manageable 45 studies in total and assign them.
“Then, they might not meet again for months,” Bjornson said.
The Legislative Management Committee also has the power to reconvene the Legislature with a majority vote, using any unused days remaining from their 80-day allotment. If Gov. Kelly Armstrong calls for a special session, the Legislature would not need to use the remaining legislative days. It’s anticipated that lawmakers may need to reconvene to address impacts from federal funding cuts.
Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, said the committee also elects its own chairperson that would have additional responsibilities during the interim, such as approving requests from lawmakers to attend meetings requiring travel reimbursement and working with the Legislative Council.
“Legislative Management doesn’t have any role in funding,” Weisz said. “We have an Emergency Commission, a Budget Section that will deal with funding issues outside of session.”
Bjornson said the Legislative Management Committee is expected to meet in June to decide which studies to pursue and make interim committee appointments.
Members of the 2025-26 Legislative Management Committee are:

Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Miles Borne, Alexander Muirhead, and Lila Muirhead didn’t vote in the 2024 presidential election. At the time, none of the three New Hampshire residents had turned 18.
But each will be legally old enough to vote by 2026. And they say a new state law requiring them to provide hard documentary evidence that they are citizens, such as with a passport or birth certificate, is going to “burden” their “ability to register to vote.”
Now, lawyers for the three hope a judge will agree. 
They are part of a lawsuit against the recent state law, joining a diverse group of plaintiffs that includes the Coalition for Open Democracy, the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire, the Forward Foundation, and several individuals.
The lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, alleges that House Bill 1569 is unconstitutional because it places an undue burden on voting by requiring documents that not all residents can easily access, risking disenfranchisement.
But as voting rights groups and the state of New Hampshire gird for potentially years of litigation, the plaintiffs face a more immediate question: Can they sue the state over a law that has not yet stopped them from voting?
Lawyers for the Attorney General’s Office, which is defending the law, say none of the plaintiffs — neither the prospective voters nor the organizations that say they are affected by it — are qualified to sue the state, a determination known as standing.
“Where is the direct impediment here?” Assistant Attorney General Michael DeGrandis asked in court. 
The new law took effect Nov. 11 last year, a week after the Nov. 5 presidential election, and has not yet affected any statewide elections. It was in place during the town meeting season this spring, and advocates say at least 96 people were turned away from voting as a result of not possessing the proper documentation. But so far, none of those 96 people has joined the lawsuit. 
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said under previous case law, the individuals and groups do not need to be directly disenfranchised to be harmed by the new statute.
“Those folks were injured as soon as the law was passed, as soon as the law came into effect,” Jacob van Leer, a staff attorney at the ACLU Voting Rights Project who is helping represent the plaintiffs, said at a press conference. “The urgency, I think, could not be more present here with the 2026 elections coming up.”
The arguments came to a head during a lengthy stretch of oral arguments in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire last week. Judge Samantha Elliott is considering a motion by the state to dismiss the lawsuit entirely. Part of that motion is an argument that the law has not sufficiently harmed the people suing.
The fight over the new state law, which imposes the most stringent voter registration requirements in the country, comes as Republicans are pushing similar legislation on the national stage. On April 10, the U.S. House passed the SAVE Act, which would in part require hard documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for federal elections nationwide, but the bill is likely to struggle to overcome the 60-vote requirement in the Senate to escape a filibuster. 
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump issued an executive order on March 25 that directed the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to require proof of U.S. citizenship. On Thursday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C., granted a preliminary injunction to temporarily halt that order. 
In the New Hampshire lawsuit, the plaintiffs say the state law will affect them in multiple ways.
McKenzie Taylor, the New Hampshire state director of America Votes, an advocacy organization, got married in 2024 and changed her last name; the name on her birth certificate is St. Germain, her maiden name. As of September, when the lawsuit was filed, Taylor had not updated her name on her passport or state driver’s license. In the lawsuit, she argues the new law would require her to do so in order to vote, a financial burden.
December Rust is an unhoused man living in Littleton without a passport or access to his birth certificate, who has argued he would not be able to easily obtain it. He has also argued that because the law eliminated challenged voter affidavits — which allowed people to cast a ballot even when an election observer challenged their citizenship or other qualification at the polls — he could be targeted by a challenge with no ability to defend himself. 
Each advocacy organization involved says the new law impairs their ability to carry out their missions, which include helping residents register to vote. 
DeGrandis argued each of the people or organizations suing is flawed. He argued the organizations have not sufficiently shown that HB 1569 is a threat to their missions.
“Open Democracy isn’t turning anyone away,” he said. “They’re providing this information. And if someone doesn’t have documentation, they’re saying you need that documentation. That’s not turning someone away, that’s advising.”
And he said the individual plaintiffs have not suffered injury from the law, and especially not injury with “actual or imminent concrete and particularized harm.”
“There’s a difference between preference and injury,” DeGrandis said. “That’s why the youth plaintiffs don’t have standing. They’re engaging in speculation regarding how the remedy would operate to remedy the harm that they allege.”
Elliott appeared skeptical of that critique. 
“I’m confused as to your confusion,” she said. “They complained that they would have to bring documentation, and with the remedy, they would not need to bring documentation.”
And van Leer said the organizations faced an immediate impediment in understanding the law. “We still have no idea what it means to need other reasonable documentation proving citizenship. It makes it impossible for these organizations to provide clear voter registration services to voters when they themselves don’t know what that means.” 
Lawyers for the ACLU filed the lawsuit early, in September, in order to secure an injunction against the new law before the next statewide elections in September 2026. The timing meant that none of the plaintiffs had been directly affected by the law when it was filed. But in court, they emphasized that a law can be blocked as unconstitutional even before it has disenfranchised someone, and noted that the lawsuit could proceed even if Elliott rejects some or even most of the plaintiffs, as long as she finds that at least one has standing. 
Elliott at times appeared to agree with the argument that at least some of the plaintiffs had shown a burden. 
“The issue is: What barrier does this law impose on voting?” Elliott asked. “In this case, the barrier that it imposes is this requirement to produce the identification.”
If the SAVE Act passes the Senate and is signed by Trump, or if Trump’s executive order survives a court challenge, New Hampshire could be required to participate in a national scheme very similar to HB 1569 — and one that would supersede that law and any block on it by a court. For now, attorneys for the plaintiffs say they are pushing the attempt to stop the state law from moving ahead.
“It seems like HB 1569 is a solution in search of a problem in ways that ultimately will require individuals to scrounge together very limited forms of documentation that many folks don’t have at all, and, even more, don’t have immediate access to in order to exercise their fundamental rights,” van Leer said at the press conference.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/voteridnh-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-04-28 05:03:22.975135

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)  The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.











I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
States consider high costs, possible savings of covering weight-loss drugs for their workers

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

(Getty Images)A Louisiana lawmaker says he wants to avoid the scenario that unfolded last year in Alabama, where clinics offering in vitro fertilization closed their doors rather than risk legal liability based on a new interpretation of a 19th century law.
The matter has pitted some conservative Republicans, who normally take the same side on reproductive health issues, against one another. It also provides a glimpse into the national debate over IVF, which proponents fear could be threatened under Trump administration policy.
Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, received committee approval Tuesday for Senate Bill 156, which he said “is essential for IVF to continue in Louisiana.” But the proposal’s language had to be massaged to get the backing of one staunch anti-abortion lawmaker. Even then, the measure is still opposed by the state’s top two anti-abortion groups.
Senate Health and Welfare Committee member Rick Edmonds, R-Baton Rouge, stood firm on making a change to the definition of embryo in Pressly’s proposal. As a state representative, he authored a 2016 law to prohibit abortions for genetic abnormalities.
Originally, Pressly’s bill referred to an “in vitro fertilized human embryo” as one that “has certain rights granted by law … and organized that it may develop in utero into an unborn child.” Edmonds amended the proposal to define an embryo as “biologically human,” removing any reference to whether it actually develops into a child.
These seemingly subtle differences in language could become critical if its final version creates a situation similar to what happened last year in Alabama. Its state Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos outside the womb are considered children under the law, citing an 1872 statute that allows lawsuits for the wrongful death of a child. Fearing potential legal consequences from embryos that become nonviable – even through no fault of their own – IVF clinics in Alabama shut down.
The Alabama Legislature then scrambled to approve civil and criminal protections for IVF providers, leading clinics to reopen. There remain concerns, however, over whether long-term access will remain available.
The Trump administration’s cuts to federal health care programs have served to reinforce such worries about the future of IVF. Staff reductions at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will curtail research into IVF and other fertility treatments, experts say.
The changes have unfolded rapidly, even though Trump referred to himself as the “fertilization president” after signing an executive order last month to expand fertility treatment access. A separate order from Trump in February sought policy direction on IVF, yet Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency went ahead with the CDC attrition plans.

Anti-abortion groups back status quo
Louisiana Right to Life and Louisiana Family Forum oppose Pressly’s bill. Both groups were at the forefront of creating one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans three years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. The landmark 1973 opinion declared women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but it also said states could regulate when the procedure is allowed. With the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022, justices removed the federal right to an abortion and opened doors to outright state bans.
During Tuesday’s committee hearing, Pressly insisted his proposal was essential to ensure IVF remains available to 1 in 6 families that struggle with infertility, citing numbers the World Health Organization has used. It has been nearly 40 years since Louisiana has updated its IVF statute, and health technology improvements in the interim need to be reflected in the law, the senator said.
Kathleen Benfield, legislative director with Louisiana Family Forum, told the committee the Pressly proposal is unnecessary because the state’s IVF law has never been challenged.
“Not one example has been given where the practice of in vitro fertilization or any other artificial reproduction technology has been threatened (in Louisiana), and I don’t think it will be threatened,” Benfield said.
Even with Edmonds’ amendment, the bill’s language was still problematic for Benfield. She took issue with describing a “viable in vitro fertilized embryo” as a “juridical person,” or an entity that has the same rights in law as a person but is not a human being.
Put another way, Pressly’s bill doesn’t go nearly far enough to treat embryos as children, according to Benfield. A juridical person is “not the same thing as a natural person,” she said.
Last year, anti-abortion forces pushed to change to an IVF protection bill Rep. Paula Davis, R-Baton Rouge, sponsored. She shelved her bill when rather than include the term “biological human beings” in it, fearing it could lead to criminal consequences for reproductive care providers.
Davis has authored another version of her bill this year, but it has yet to be scheduled for a House committee hearing in the lawmaking session that ends June 12.
Erica Inzina, policy director for Louisiana Right to Life, said the state’s current IVF law has room for improvement, but it still offers the most protection for human embryos of any state. Pressly’s bill would weaken those safeguards, she said.
“It leaves the embryo looking a lot more like a thing rather than a person,” Inzina told the committee.
‘We’re quibbling’
The proposed changes are the product of a rather unusual partnership: Pressly, who gained approval for a first-of-its-kind abortion drug restriction; and Katie Bliss, an attorney whose firm specializes in in vitro fertilization contracts.
Pressly, who joined the Senate last year after four years as a state representative, authored a law in 2024 that treats mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances. Both medications are used in abortions but have other applications, including lifesaving ones. The Schedule IV status puts them on par with drugs that have addiction and abuse potential, meaning hospitals have to keep them under lock and key.
Some health care providers have said the added layers of security for controlled dangerous substances put women’s lives at risk when, for example, misoprostol is needed immediately to stop postpartum hemorrhaging.
Bliss has two children conceived through IVF. She said the revisions to existing law are needed to protect patients and physicians while also ensuring care for embryos.
Louisiana is the only state that’s made the destruction of embryos illegal, and conservative lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully in the past to stop patients from shipping embryos out of state for disposal. Such measures are unconstitutional, Bliss said, because one state can’t tell another state how to conduct business.
Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, attempted last year to end embryo transports across state lines, but the amendment he tried to attach to another lawmaker’s bill was ruled irrelevant to the original proposal and therefore was not allowed.
Pressly said his bill covers this scenario because it would make any IVF contract null and void if it includes a provision for the intentional destruction of an embryo.
Edmonds also objected to the removal of the terms “married couple” and “parental” from a section of existing IVF law that deals with embryo donations. Instead, “person” is used to describe an embryo donor and recipient.
Pressly told Edmonds keeping “couple” in the law could create constitutional issues, implying it conveys bias against single people who want to start a family through IVF.
“It would be hypocritical for me to vote for a bill that would eliminate parental rights,” Edmonds said, though Pressly assured him his proposal doesn’t pose that threat.
Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, shared with other committee members that she personally had a “horrible history of miscarriages” and feared her children would have the same difficulty. Through IVF, her son and daughter-in-law have given her three of her eight grandchildren.
Mizell said she had “a hard time finding obstacles” in a bill that gives more people the opportunity to start and grow families.
“I’m listening to pro-life people argue with pro-life people,” Mizell said, who then recounted efforts during her nine years in the Senate to put strict abortion laws in place. As a result, she said Louisiana has the strongest anti-abortion laws in the nation.
“… We’re there and we’re quibbling” over language to protect IVF, she said.

Known for their impressive speed, peregrines typically nest on sheer cliffs, but have adapted to utilize nesting boxes installed on skyscrapers.

For the second time in recent weeks, a North Carolina Republican judge has courageously put the constitution ahead of their political party.
First, it was Supreme Court Justice Richard Dietz who rightfully dissented when his four Republican colleagues okayed a GOP effort to change election rules after the election in last fall’s disputed Supreme Court contest.
And last week, Superior Court Judge Lori Hamilton helped strike down a law passed by the Republican-dominated legislature last fall to seize powers from Gov. Josh Stein.
The law would have placed the auditor – in effect, the state’s accountant – in charge of appointing the state Board of Elections.
In rejecting the scheme, Hamilton wrote that the duty to faithfully execute the laws has been exclusively assigned to the governor and cannot be reassigned without violating the constitution.
Good for her.
The bottom line: In this time in which a handful of politicians are trying to seize and monopolize more and more power, courageous judges are a bulwark against despotism. North Carolina is fortunate to have two of them.

Santiago/Getty Images) Ripple effects of potential federal funding cuts have been spotlighted by advocates in essentially every sector, from the overall economy to school lunches and infectious diseases. But one such potential cut, and a proposal in the Ohio House’s version of the state budget, could directly impact an issue the state has been struggling to improve for decades: infant and maternal mortality.
Ohio has been near the bottom of rankings for infant mortality rates in the country, and has seen significant maternal mortality rates as well. With children making up one-third of national Medicaid enrollment and 40% of all births in the country covered by Medicaid, cuts to that program could mean even more struggles for the state’s children and mothers.
Part of the problem that already exists within the Medicaid system, specifically in Ohio, is a low reimbursement rate that results in some physicians refusing to accept Medicaid patients, and other facilities, like Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, relying on donor support to compensate for the low reimbursement rates.
“Even when we talk about infant mortality, this Medicaid reimbursement rate is a huge factor in why the infant mortality rate is so abysmal,” said Erica Wilson-Domer, president and CEO of the greater Ohio arm of Planned Parenthood.
Of the patients who seek care from the facility, 43% are covered by Medicaid, which includes coverage for wellness exams, vaccines and cancer screenings, among other services, according to Planned Parenthood.
“I am deeply concerned about the potential cuts to Medicaid and what it will to do the overall health of Ohioans,” Wilson-Domer said.
She also pointed to rising rates of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis as a timely reason to avoid cutting public health funding. A report from the Cleveland Department of Public Health showed an increase in syphilis case rates “across all age groups,” but individuals age 30-39 had the highest case rate from 2019 to 2020.
Male Cleveland residents saw a case rate of more than 150 per 100,000 residents in 2021, and cases in women, which had previously been “stable” from 2017 to 2020 nearly doubled in 2021, according to the Cleveland report.
Loss of care
Cuts in health funding, particularly Medicaid funding could not only impact those who are covered under the program, but also medical facilities across the state, even those who may not accept Medicaid.
“If there’s lost access to preventive care, that moves care to emergency rooms,” Wilson-Domer said. “Remember, it’s more expensive to go to the ER, and these patients don’t have the ability to pay, so the burden is on the hospital.”
Those who may have commercial insurance will see impacts too, if ERs are now filled with those who no longer have Medicaid coverage. Wait times could increase for everyone, even those who go to emergency rooms for truly emergent issues, Wilson-Domer said.

State funding decisions in the Ohio House budget proposal could add to the uncertainty, as the House absorbed a proposal from Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive budget to cut Group VIII, or the Ohioans who are part of the Medicaid expansion program, if the federal contribution to Medicaid drops below 90%.
Advocates have said that will leave around 770,000 Ohioans without health insurance, leaving them with few options for care.
As discussions pop up on the federal side about encouraging women to have children through one-time funds, lowering of funding in the Medicaid program could result in more women delaying care and impacting their pregnancy because of a lack of access to the health care they need.
With the reimbursement rate low, and the potential for cuts to the state program if federal Medicaid contributions are lowered, pregnant individuals and their children could face an uncertain future.
“What ends up happening, there’s a newly pregnant person on Medicaid, but they can’t find a provider who will see them, and so they don’t end up being seen until later in the pregnancy,” Wilson-Domer said.
If the pregnant individual develops conditions like gestational diabetes or other treatable conditions, a delay in care could mean it’s too late to treat those conditions.
“If we want to really impact the maternal mortality and the infant mortality rate … what we need to do is increase the reimbursement rate so people will want to see these patients,” according to Wilson-Domer.
Reproductive health
The GOP fight over reproductive health has led to a slashing of “family planning” grants at the federal level impacting Title X funds, talk of national abortion bans, government websites on reproductive health being taken down and threats of defunding Planned Parenthood all together, which all tie in to discussions about reducing medical care for low-income families through Medicaid, according to advocates.
A study by the Gender Equity Policy Institute found that those living in states with abortion bans were nearly 2 times as likely to die during pregnancy, child birth or shortly following birth, compared to states that allow abortion.
The maternal mortality rate worsens for Black mothers in states with bans, with the GEPI finding those mothers were 3.3 times more likely to die compared with White mothers in the state.
“Even before abortion was outlawed, the states that subsequently banned abortion had worse outcomes on key indicators of reproductive health,” the GEPI stated.
Ohio couldn’t enforce the six-week ban that was put in place in 2019 because of court challenges, but once Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide, was overturned, Attorney General Dave Yost quickly sought for a court to break the ban of its court challenges, which a federal court did.
The six-week abortion ban was in effect for a short time before abortion rights advocates sued to get the ban struck down. Enforcement is currently stopped once again, after a Hamilton County Court sided with abortion clinics and advocates that the new constitutional amendment passed in November of 2023 gave abortion rights to Ohioans.
The court’s decision is currently under appeal with the First District Court of Appeals, but Yost has said he’s not appealing the decision to strike down the abortion ban, but instead argues other parts of the court decision overreach to the state laws that regulate reproductive health and abortion services.
Other provisions in Ohio law that impact abortion services have been overturned in court, like a 24-hour waiting period required before abortion services could be conducted, and another rule against virtual visits to provide medication abortion services.
Wilson-Domer said Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and their supporters “continue to bang our heads against the wall with legislators” to inform them that the health and Medicaid services dollars are “critical,” that the loss of those funds would impact all Ohioans, and that current laws that regulate such services at health clinics that also provide abortions are not only unconstitutional, but unhelpful.
“What we seek to do is provide a safe space for people to get good medical care that they need,” Wilson-Domer said.

An advocate for immigrants said it’s a bad idea to house them in facilities built for people accused of committing crimes.
Trump ran on false claims that migrants commit high rates of crime and on promises that he would deport millions. 
But mass deportations are a lot harder than Trump made it sound. And his administration is reclassifying people who came legally and asking help from local law enforcement as it tries to live up to his promises.
One way it’s done that is by signing contracts with sheriffs to house detainees in county jails. 
So far in Ohio, ICE has contracted with Seneca, Mahoning, Butler, and Geauga counties, said Lynn Tramonte of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. It has also contracted with Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio, a multi-county jail, and Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, a private prison in Youngstown, she said.
Trump might act as if it’s a crime to be in the United States without documents, but it’s not, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
“The act of being present in the United States in violation of the immigration laws is not, standing alone, a crime,” it said in an issue brief.  “While federal immigration law does criminalize some actions that may be related to undocumented presence in the United States, undocumented presence alone is not a violation of federal criminal law. Thus, many believe that the term ‘illegal alien,’ which may suggest a criminal violation, is inaccurate or misleading.”
What is a crime is illegal entry — coming into the country without declaring it to authorities.
“Entering the United States without being inspected and admitted, i.e., illegal entry, is a misdemeanor or can be a felony, depending on the circumstances,” the ACLU said. “But many undocumented immigrants do not enter the United States illegally. They enter legally but overstay, work without authorization, drop out of school or violate the conditions of their visas in some other way. Current estimates are that approximately 45% of undocumented immigrants did not enter illegally.”
Trump is trying to deport many of those people, in addition to trying to revoke protections of those who came legally under temporary protected status, or by using the CBP 1 app. 
Tramonte said county slammers are not the place to hold migrants.
“We are literally putting people who are not charged with crimes in a criminal jail,” she said in an email. 
She listed what she believes are some of the harms: “Taking them away from their families, jobs, and communities, making them rot in jail, while their immigration cases are pending. Making it harder for them to work with lawyers and win their cases. In the United States, you can be eligible for deportation and legal status at the same time. It’s up to the courts to figure out which way to go.”
Several Ohio counties contracted with ICE to house migrants during the first Trump administration. There were some problems.
Detainees complained of mistreatment by jail staff. And at one point, the jail in Morrow County had a 100% covid infection rate.
Tramonte warned that taxpayers were on the hook to defend the lawsuits that were filed during the first Trump administration and likely would be again.

(Getty Images)Let me tell you the story of the sex raft.
Back in 1973, anthropologist Santiago Genovés conducted an astonishing social experiment. He picked a crew of men and women to pilot a custom-built raft through the Atlantic Ocean for months, beginning in Spain’s Canary Islands and ending in Mexico. Genovés sought nothing less than an understanding of fundamental human conflict, with the hopes of advancing world peace.
And goodness gracious, did he have hypotheses about what would happen.
The Guardian newspaper reported an array of his deranged thoughts: “Most conflicts are about sexual access to ovulating females.” “I believe that in a dangerous situation people will act on their instincts, and I will be able to study them.” “Maybe men will become more frustrated when women are in charge, and try to take over power.”
Genovés approached the mission with all the misguided confidence of politicos in the Kansas Statehouse and Washington, D.C. Like him, these power-hungry men believe they can manipulate and persuade members of the public into being their willing dupes. Like him, they believe they can avoid negative consequences while reaping personal benefits. Also like him, I believe they’re going to end up sorely disappointed.
To make a dramatic story short, none of Genovés’ predictions proved correct. Those on the raft, which was actually named the Acali, got along perfectly well. Crew members did have some sex, but they generally focused on survival and working together. This infuriated the researcher, who regularly tried to stir up drama on board, at one point firing the woman he had chosen as captain.
He wrote in a journal: “I can tell that violence is present deep down in their unconscious, but so far it is resting under the surface.”
Eventually, the crew rebelled. They reinstated the previous captain and Genovés fell into a deep depression, exiling himself below decks and musing about how his own desire for control had led to such a colossal failure. (He also hated the “sex raft” nickname given to the expedition by sarcastic journalists.)
What he didn’t understand was that the sex raft expedition had been a success — just not in the way he imagined. The surviving crew members told a documentarian in 2019 that they found a common cause and mission through the voyage. Some had escaped domestic violence and racism. The barely controlled environment actually gave them a supportive community. Some members apparently even considered offing Genovés together.
I’ve been thinking about the sex raft a lot lately, because I’m a sucker for hope and we’re living through less-than-hopeful times.
Maybe Kansans and Americans will fight among themselves while the country burns, not taking a moment to step back and assess the situation. Maybe elected officials and fundraisers and consultants and messaging gurus have all the information they need to perfectly manipulate us one way or another.
But perhaps not. Take property taxes. Republicans expanded their supermajorities in the House and Senate with promises to lower the sales tax burden on Kansans. What did they end up doing during the session? Next to nothing.
Members might think that Kansans weren’t watching. I can tell them firsthand that the crewmates on raft Sunflower noticed. On Thursday, Kansas Reflector staff appeared at the Trails That Connect Us event in Lawrence. The gathering featured beer, entertainment and various community organizations. I spoke at length to one reader who definitely had noticed the lack of action on property taxes.
He saw. He understood. He felt frustrated.
Likewise, Kansas politicians sent a constitutional amendment to voters that would change the selection process for Kansas Supreme Court justices. They clearly hope to reverse rulings on abortion and school finance that have forced the state to respect reproductive rights and fully fund education.
Leaders didn’t talk about the amendment that way during the session, though. They hailed voice of the people — never mind the fact that people already had their say and supported abortion access. Do they expect the crew of our Sunflower raft to sit back and listen to spin from only one side?
“We all know elections are not for sale,” Rep. Susan Humphries, R-Wichita, said during the amendment, echoing some of Genovés’ weirder proclamations.
People are smarter than officials believe. Just like the folks who navigated the Atlantic more than a half-century ago, we look out for one another. We don’t seek conflict. We want to work together.
We may disagree on matters big and small. But I like to think that if you threw us all aboard a raft, we would find a way to cooperate. We would support people who knew what they were doing. We would contribute what we could, because that’s how you survive.
And we would steer through the tumultuous waves together.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)I was born with Muscular Dystrophy, I’ve always been in a wheelchair, and I’ve always held a job. Medicaid Buy-In supports my healthcare needs and enables me to remain employed. 
Many think Medicaid is simply government-subsidized health insurance, but for me, and millions of others like me, it is so much more. It allows me to live independently in a home that I own. It pays for modifications like a ramp and roll-in shower that make life’s routines easier.   
Most importantly, Medicaid pays the wages of my caregivers who support my personal care needs and household tasks. As a 59-year old, it enables me to stay employed, leave the house, and live a fulfilling life. Without it, these things would be impossible because I would be stuck in bed with no one to care for me.   
Congress is currently considering significant cuts to Medicaid. The House and Senate have passed a joint budget resolution, calling for the House Energy and Commerce Committee to make $880 billion in cuts and the Senate Finance Committee to make $1.5 trillion in cuts to its programs – requiring large cuts to Medicaid. 
Currently, House and Senate committees are working to decide where and how much to cut. Any cuts or barriers to enrollment will have cascading impacts across the United States, putting the health and independence of Medicaid beneficiaries at risk.  
For those of us living with neuromuscular diseases, Medicaid allows us to plan for long-term care.
 If Medicaid suffers funding cuts, the consequences will be significant. We will likely face delayed treatments, be unable to afford life-saving medication, and have increased difficulty affording the homecare assistance that we need to be healthy and fulfilled. 
Medicaid is a pathway to better health outcomes, financial stability, and an overall higher quality of life. Preexisting health care issues, like lengthy home care waitlists, nursing shortages, and hospital closures are likely to follow as well, compounding the negative impacts.  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Affordable and adequate health care is not a luxury; it’s a necessity. As the single-largest source of health insurance for Americans, it covers 72 million Americans. 
I am one of nearly 3 million Ohioans who rely on Medicaid daily. In Columbus and across Ohio’s 3rd Congressional District, where I live, 23.9% of our residents are enrolled in Medicaid — compared to the national average of 22.7%. This increased vulnerability puts many beneficiaries at risk of life-altering consequences.  
I deeply fear for the outcomes of others who depend on the service. It covers 2 in 5 adults with a disability, 2 in 5 births, and 2 in 5 children. Whether or not you are on Medicaid, chances are that someone you love needs it. 
Potential cuts will directly or indirectly impact nearly every single Ohioan. As Congress moves forward deciding what pieces of the federal budget get cut, I hope that Medicaid remains safe.  
For many Ohioans, there are no other opportunities to receive the health benefits, services, and treatments that we need besides Medicaid. If cuts are made, we will have to make difficult decisions about how to pay for the healthcare we need. 
I need Ohio U.S. Sens. Moreno and Husted to know that the lives of real Americans like me and so many others are in real danger if Medicaid budget cuts are enacted. Ohioans rely on Medicaid to live fulfilling and free lives. Please act in the best interest of those you represent.

ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Get rid of FEMA? Trump-appointed group to look at shifting disaster response to states.

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

When Rep. Michael Soboleski of Phillips presented LD 1656, which is co-sponsored by nine other Republicans, to the Judiciary Committee on Friday, he described the measure as sending “a clear message that Maine values the safety of its citizens and the partnerships that make that safety possible.” 
Those opposed to the bill argued it would subvert the balance of powers between federal and state governments and run afoul of existing state laws and the U.S. Constitution. 
If passed, government and law enforcement entities would not be able to “adopt or maintain a law, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, policy, directive, order, practice or procedure, formal or informal, written or unwritten” that prohibits or “materially restricts” the entity from complying with or assisting in the enforcement of immigration law. 
First Maine police department joins ICE partnership

Immigration law is defined in the bill as both state or federal law relating to immigrants or immigration, including but not limited to the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. 
Among the prohibited restrictions listed in the bill are preventing participation in any program authorized under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program. 
The Wells Police Department in York County is the only department in Maine so far to enter into an agreement for that program, which allows its officers to arrest people on immigration violations in the course of routine work, an authority previously reserved for federal agents. Some in the community are calling for the contract to be terminated. 
While the Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, had also initially applied, the department withdrew its application due to community pushback.  
This restriction in LD 1656 appears to be in direct conflict with another bill, LD 1259, proposed by Democrats to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities.
Soboleski said inconsistent policies regarding the sharing and use of information can undermine the overarching goal of enforcing the rule of law, as an example pointing to the benefits of cooperation between state and federal agencies in combating drug trafficking along the border.
Alicia Rea, policy fellow with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said undermining state and local governments’ power to exercise discretion about law enforcement priorities in their communities would undermine the 10th Amendment, which enshrined the principle of federalism.
Rea also argued the bill could lead to violations of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the 14th Amendment, which addresses due process, by exposing state and local agencies to expensive litigation and potential civil liability. 
Community members request Wells Police terminate contract with ICE

Beyond official partnerships, LD 1656 would prevent state and local government and law enforcement from generally refusing to assist with immigration enforcement, preventing federal immigration officers from conducting enforcement activities in local jails and sharing information about a person’s immigration status. 
Those entities also couldn’t refuse to cooperate with an immigration detainer, defined in the bill as a “facially sufficient” request from a federal immigration agency. 
Facially sufficient, according to the bill, means either a completed, official form that indicates on its face that the agency has probable cause to believe a person is a “a removable alien” under federal immigration law, or an incomplete form that does not indicate probable cause but is supported by an administrative warrant that does. 
Unlike judicial warrants issued by a court, an administrative warrant is issued by a federal agency and does not permit authorities to enter a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy without consent. 
The top concern among Wells residents calling for the termination of the ICE contract is entangling their local police with the agency’s recent illegitimate enforcement. Rea pointed out to the committee on Friday that, according to ICE’s own records, the agency’s enforcement has not always been exact. For example, between 2008 and 2012, the agency issued detainers against 834 U.S. citizens and 28,489 legal permanent residents, or “green card” holders. 
LD 1656 would also establish a complaint process for members of the public to report any government or law enforcement entity to the state Attorney General for violating the restrictions set out in the legislation. 
If the Attorney General determines an entity is in violation, the officer would be required to issue an opinion and the entity would then have 30 days to appeal. If the Superior Court agrees with the Attorney General, it must issue an injunction and the entity would face a $500 daily fine for each day its practice remains in effect. 
The only person to testify in support of the bill on Friday, former Republican state representative Lawrence Lockman from Bradley, urged the committee to increase that penalty to $10,000 per day. 
While not opining on the immigration policy behind the bill, Julie Finn, analyst for Maine’s Judicial Branch, said the branch opposes the bill because of what she characterized as the  problematic legal process it proposes. 
It lacks an adjudicatory process, which would involve a neutral third party, Finn said. The Attorney General can only issue opinions on a question of law not on a question of fact, and only final agency action is generally appealable.  
Finn also raised concern about the bill’s ambiguity as to whether judicial marshals are included in the definition of law enforcement agency. 
She requested these positions be excluded, as their primary purpose is to provide protection and security for judicial branch employees and members of the public in a courthouse, not to investigate, apprehend people or enforce criminal violations. 
Immigration arrests in courthouses elsewhere in the country have led to growing concern that the work of local justice systems is being undermined by making immigrants fearful of coming to court. On Friday in Wisconsin, FBI agents arrested a Milwaukee County Judge, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action.
The co-sponsors of LD 1656 are Sens. Scott Cyrway and Dick Bradstreet, both representing parts of Kennebec County, and Reps. Richard Campbell of Orrington, Abigail Griffin of Levant, Gary Drinkwater of Milford, James Thorne of Carmel, Jeffrey Sean Adams of Lebanon, Katrina Smith of Palermo and Reagan Paul of Winterport.

(Stock photo by Birute/Getty Images Plus)Over 360,000 Catholics call Nebraska home. As a cradle, conflicted and often non-practicing version of that theology, I may have been part of that number. Suffice to say being contrary and asking questions is part of my DNA, a trait journalists find helpful. Perhaps not so much for those on a spiritual journey. 
Neither the current condition of my “lapseness” nor my contrarian ways matter much, however, when it’s clear that in a world awash in a rising tide of tough guys (and women) — whose dispassionate search of even greater power teems with toxicity — Pope Francis was a blessed bulwark against the further coarsening and dividing of humanity.
Most important was that he did so with grace, dignity and a sense of humor. Others may have formidable armies, the obedience of others borne of fear or the means and motives to take what they want. 
Life of service
Pope Francis had more: A true “power,” a spirit steeped in service, compassion and gentleness, a massive dose of which the world could use.
He walked the walk of gospel — perhaps his own brand of “wokeness” — focusing his servant ministry on those living on the margins of life, those with the least power, the smallest voices and the fewest options. Among them are the poorest of the poor, refugees and migrants and vulnerable members of the LGBTQ community. He preached the imperative that we must care for and restore the earth.
He famously skipped much of the papal pomp, which many of his more conservative and traditional predecessors preferred. He was also fearless in poking some of the church’s billion-plus members in their very Catholic ribs. His modern, progressive views never sat well with a number of bishops and cardinals. Nor was he averse to standing against the aforementioned world’s most powerful.
The scandal involving priests sexually abusing children changed him. By his admission, Francis said he was wrong when, on a visit to Chile, he defended an accused bishop. He apologized to the victims he slighted, set in motion an investigation, the result of which toppled the entire Chilean church leadership. Still, even though Pope Francis convened a summit of clergy in Rome to address the scandal, many believe he didn’t go far enough.
Willing to criticize
As a critic of the war in Gaza, Pope Francis’ death was barely acknowledged in official Israel, where the government offered condolences on social media, but later deleted them. Aside from being critical of Israel’s prosecution of the war, Francis suggested an investigation into Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as the war dragged on. The pope had spoken with a small community of Catholics in Gaza every evening since the war began. 
Francis also reached out to Muslim leaders, a prickly bridge too far for some among the faithful. He challenged the church’s views on the death penalty and in 2018 officially changed Catholic teaching, calling capital punishment ​“an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person,” and ​“inadmissible” in all cases. He also altered the church’s stance on nuclear weapons, deeming them immoral, yet was often silent on Russia’s invasion of and war on Ukraine.
Other detractors have argued that while he promoted women in the church, he didn’t go far enough, elevating them to leadership roles at the Vatican but stopping short of calling for their admission into the priesthood.
Surely, for some, his legacy will be mixed.
Immigration was where he was most outspoken, admonishing world leaders — including the current U.S. administration — to find solutions to the massive displacement of people around the globe consistent with not only the gospel, but more broadly simple humanity. 
Where some see migrants as parasites and pariahs, Francis saw them as human beings. During what would be his last message, he said, “How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants! … I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!” 
I read a condolence for Pope Francis in the vast, ecumenical ethos of social media, followed immediately by a wish that his successor be anything but the aforementioned “woke.” Yes, God forbid the Vatican continue to challenge injustice, minister to outcasts and value the planet.
All of which makes me miss him already.

We MUST raise our voices again and again to preserve these ideals.","I am a family physician with 39 years experience caring for patients and teaching medical students and family medicine residents.
Donald Trump’s executive orders and election have removed the sense of stability and security that many, but not all Americans had become accustomed to — much in the same way that a child relies on the safety provided by his or her parents in a home that feels safe and secure.

Howard Selinger, MD
Most Americans have lived for years, secure in the knowledge that our government by design, although not always in practice for all people, respects the rule of law and operates according to ethical principles of fairness and the pursuit of the common good.
That has now changed as this Trump administration embarks on reshaping the design of government checks and balances. 
There is undoubtedly a tremendous amount of stress being generated for millions of Americans who feel threatened financially, psychologically and societally. As a family physician, I have seen what stress can do to a person’s health. Stress  not only triggers flare-ups of underlying pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, emphysema, diabetes and other medical conditions but can also trigger serious episodes of mental illness including anxiety, depression, and even promote risks to oneself or others.
This is damaging governance. Job loss threatens healthcare affordability and sustainability for the individual and at great cost to the GDP of this country of lost productivity and output, certainly at odds with this administration’s purported claim to reduce the federal deficit. We must, as stated by Abraham Lincoln, preserve government “of the people, by the people, for the people.” Attacking diversity, equity and inclusion and gender affirming care is blatantly unethical and anti-democratic.
Estimates are that nearly 200, 000 individuals or four percent of the federal workforce will have their jobs terminated. Law allows for only 31 days of continued health coverage after job termination. Further maintenance of federal employee health benefits requires the individual to pay both the worker’s share and the government’s share  which would cost the employee for family coverage over $1,800 per month which is out of reach for most Americans.   
This federal behavior will inevitably harm our most vulnerable citizens.
Longer term, the threatened defunding of the Department of Education , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Institutes of Health “indirect funding” support for critical healthcare research will degrade the health of our nation. Imagine handicapping the CDC’s ability to prepare for future pandemics, or to identify and prevent widespread food source contamination. State Medicaid programs have been targeted for significant funding reductions that will potentially cause millions of low-income and disabled Americans to lose their health coverage.
It is always the goal to deliver high-value healthcare and avoid unnecessary expenses. We teach this every day as we train future family physicians.
In the beloved story “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens, Scrooge states that regarding the vulnerable population, “If they would rather die, they had better do it and decrease the surplus population.” This callousness is reflected in our present day presidential leadership. 
Diversity, equity, inclusion and the common good are the pillars of our democratic culture. We MUST raise our voices again and again to preserve these ideals. There is no other alternative.

These are students with the most significant needs, students who deserve every opportunity to thrive, and who often rely on specialized supports to access a free and appropriate public education. Yet for years, the state and federal governments have underfunded this grant, shifting the financial burden onto local school districts and municipalities and leaving many communities struggling to meet both student needs and budget demands.
This year, the Connecticut General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee took an important step forward. The Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents (CAPSS) extends sincere thanks to Sen. Catherine A. Osten, Rep. Toni E. Walker, and members of the Appropriations Committee for voting to approve an additional $124 million in each year of the biennium for the Excess Cost Grant. If enacted by the full General Assembly, this funding would, for the first time ever, fully fund the Excess Cost Grant for the 2025 – 2026 school year.
This is not just a budget decision; it’s a moral commitment. Fully funding the Excess Cost Grant ensures that every student, regardless of ability, can access the specialized instruction and services they need. It affirms our values as a state that prioritizes equity, inclusion, and educational opportunity for all.
It also provides tangible relief to local school districts and municipalities. Special education costs are unpredictable and, in some cases, extraordinary. When the state falls short in its obligation to share these costs, districts are forced to reallocate local resources, often at the expense of other programs or services. Full funding allows district leaders to stabilize their budgets, plan more effectively, and maintain the full range of supports their students and communities require.
This has long been a top legislative priority for CAPSS, as well as for Connecticut’s Special Education Task Force. We now urge the full General Assembly to act decisively to approve this investment. Doing so would demonstrate a powerful commitment to students with disabilities, to equity in public education, and to the fiscal health of our towns and cities.
Connecticut has the opportunity to correct a longstanding funding gap and to strengthen the foundation of support for our most vulnerable learners. Let’s seize this moment and fully fund the Excess Cost Grant.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-28 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Converting contamination into community,Jack Lambros,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/28/converting-contamination-into-community/,Connecticut’s initiative to redevelop brownfield properties is both an environmental plan and an innovative economic strategy.,"Buried below the forgotten factory floors is contaminated soil, but underneath that is a blueprint for Connecticut’s economic resurgence.
Throughout the state, it is apparent that the ghosts of Connecticut’s industrial past remain. They loom over communities and are usually abandoned, dilapidated, and contaminated. The presence of these vacated sites creates environmental issues and safety hazards, and most importantly, they do not fix themselves. As Connecticut’s economy has shifted away from manufacturing textiles, firearms, clocks, and hardware, these crumbling structures are left behind.


These former factories, warehouses, and industrial properties are known as brownfields. A brownfield is a term for abandoned or underutilized sites that have yet to be redeveloped due to the presence or potential presence of pollution in the building, soil, and groundwater. These sites require investigation or remediation before development. 
In the past decade, Connecticut has focused more and more on brownfield redevelopment and understanding the importance of refurbishment. These sites, along with the effects they impose on communities across the state, create numerous issues. These issues range from environmental contamination problems of soil, groundwater, and pollutants to various social and economic issues like deterrence of investments, job creation, and reduced property values.

Jack Lambros
Connecticut’s initiative to redevelop brownfield properties is both an environmental plan and an innovative economic strategy. It aims to improve neglected urban spaces, attract businesses, create housing, and provide open spaces for the community.
This also revitalizes local economies and generates tax revenue, so why does this seem too good to be true? The cost.
The redevelopment of brownfields in Connecticut faces many obstacles because of cost. Most importantly, the environmental cleanup required to decontaminate these sites substantially heightens remediation costs. To ensure and prioritize safety, Connecticut enforces high regulatory standards even after a project’s completion, resulting in higher costs. The truth is, these buildings are so old that they remember when the term “environmentally friendly” meant we dumped it behind the factory, so significant cleanup is a prerequisite to development. 
A direct example of this issue is the setbacks in the plan for a new soccer stadium in Bridgeport. This plan envisions a brand-new 7,500-seat stadium and housing, a hotel, retail stores, and restaurant spaces. Due to the site’s former tenant, the AGI rubber factory, anticipation of soil contamination is expected, potentially requiring the soil to be removed entirely or rendered inaccessible. 
This is a challenging and costly project that will likely delay  the opening and projected spring 2026 kickoff for CT United FC.  
The Connecticut DECD is providing $8 million to expedite the process, and the 2025 session of the Connecticut General Assembly is working on the quest for an unspecified amount of state aid. The legislature aims to have a financial commitment by June, but will this be enough to make this vision a reality?
In December, Governor Ned Lamont announced state grants for brownfield remediation projects statewide under the Brownfield Municipal Grant Program. The Department of Economic and Community Development’s Office of Brownfield Remediation and Development supports the grant program, providing approximately $20 million in funding to redevelop 21 properties in 18 municipalities across the State.
State investments have leveraged roughly $530 million in private investments, facilitating the creation of 1,392 new housing units and new businesses. 
Successful examples of remediation include the Colt Armory in Hartford. The former firearms manufacturer from the 19th century was abandoned for decades in Hartford’s Charter Oak neighborhood. Over six years, between 2015 and 2021, the Colt Gateway Apartments demonstrated the successes of remediation. Developers combined historical charm and character with contemporary living and commercial space, revitalizing the neighborhood into a vibrant community through the support of DECD funding. 
The paramount issue for brownfield redevelopment remains the need for increased and consistent funding. Without a reliable and substantial flow of funding, municipalities and developers face many obstacles, stalling redevelopment projects. 
The Connecticut State Legislature introduced Senate Bill 1403, for addressing the cost issue of  remediation within the state. The bill’s objective is to gather data and insights that can be used to guide future policies and initiatives on brownfield sites. The bill appears to have gained support so far, but it still seems to face scrutiny because of flaws in the allocation of resources and the overall effectiveness of proposed solutions. In the end, this bill needs the public’s support to confront the challenges that brownfields create because it is a proactive and progressive step toward the future of Connecticut’s economic development. 
Brownfield redevelopment is needed to attract business, create housing, and revitalize communities in Connecticut’s post-pandemic world. This redevelopment initiative is an investment in the future of Connecticut, while solving environmental problems and eliminating community health hazards. By transforming liabilities into community assets, and economic growth, it is a creative initiative to rethink what is needed to incentivize businesses and residents of Connecticut.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)This year’s 105-day Washington state legislative session was in many ways a trudge. 
There was a multibillion-dollar budget deficit to solve. Sharp debate on parental rights and capping rent increases. Clashes over tax policy. Tensions between the new Democratic governor and legislators in his own party. And the unexpected deaths of a sitting senator and a former House speaker.
“I’ll say certainly today, it feels like the toughest one that I’ve been through,” House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, said at a post-session news conference.
Washington lawmakers wrapped up around 6 p.m. Sunday. They spent their final day approving new two-year budgets for the state’s day-to-day operations, transportation system and capital construction.
They also put the finishing touches on two of the year’s most hotly debated pieces of legislation, one to cap residential rent increases and another delaying closure of the Rainier School, a rehabilitation center in Pierce County for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, who took office in January, applauded moves from state lawmakers to increase education funding, provide his demanded $100 million to hire more police, preserve the state’s rainy day fund, narrow their tax platform, and accept many of his proposed budget savings.
But Ferguson, who did not speak to reporters after the session adjourned, stopped short of a full-throated endorsement.
“I look forward to carefully reviewing the budgets line by line over the next few weeks,” the Democratic governor said in a statement late Sunday. “When that review is complete, I will share my thoughts with the public in greater detail.”
Budget troubles
The largest hurdle lawmakers faced entering the session was writing the next two-year budget. They knew months of lower-than-expected tax collections and an inflation-driven surge in costs were going to leave less money than needed to maintain existing levels of service.
What emerged, and cleared the House and Senate on partisan votes, is a two-year $77.8 billion budget that is balanced with spending cuts and billions of dollars in new and higher taxes.
“Reductions are hard. Revenue is hard. This budget is a combination of hard and difficult choices,” Fitzgibbon said ahead of its passage in the House.
The tax package Democrats assembled totals around $9.4 billion over four years. Much of that money — around $5.6 billion — will come from increases in the state’s main business tax. There’s also a higher rate added to the state’s capital gains tax for gains above $1 million.
Republicans in both chambers assailed the tax hikes and insisted Democrats could have written a balanced budget without them.
“When we started this session, all I heard about was making the wealthy pay their fair share,” said Rep. April Connors, R-Kennewick. “This budget spreads taxes across all working Washington residents in a manner that is going to make this state more and more and more unaffordable to live in. This budget does not fix Washington, it hurts Washington.”
A coalition of business groups also slammed Democrats over taxes, saying they were “deeply disappointed.”
“These costs simply can’t be absorbed by businesses — they will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everyday goods and services,” said Kris Johnson, president and CEO of the Association of Washington Business. 
State employee unions scored wins, with lawmakers foregoing plans for furloughs floated earlier in the session and commitments in the budget to support new collective bargaining agreements that will provide 5% pay raises over two years.
Roads, rent and guns
On a bipartisan note, the House and Senate easily passed a $15.5 billion, two-year transportation funding plan, earmarking money for state ferries, highway megaprojects and much more. That plan hinges in part on a 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax that would take effect July 1, and a raft of other tax and fee hikes. 
More than one-third of the overall sum is set aside for road improvements, allowing the state to finish some of its biggest undertakings, like the North Spokane Corridor and State Route 520. Another $895 million is set to pay for new state ferries, terminal improvements and existing vessel preservation. And the court-ordered removal of barriers to fish migration gets $1.1 billion.
“This budget keeps Washington’s roads, bridges and highways remaining safe and functional,” said House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma. “It supports the state ferry system and improves reliability. It makes commitments to repair culverts and protect Washington waterways.”
The funding plan is a leap from $13.2 billion for transportation in the current biennium set to end June 30.
In his statement, Ferguson applauded the transportation investments, but was silent on the new revenue that would help pay for them.
And in unanimous votes, lawmakers approved a separate $7.5 billion for infrastructure projects, including record investments in affordable housing as well as money for K-12 school construction, salmon recovery and behavioral health facilities.
Progressive Democrats scored some long-sought victories, pushing through the bill that will limit annual rent increases for many tenants across Washington, capping hikes at 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. A bill to provide up to six weeks of unemployment insurance benefits for striking workers also made it through. 
Legislation to require a new state permit to buy guns is poised for action from the governor, too. The state would join about a dozen others with similar gun control laws.
One of the more fiery conflicts had to do with the rights of public school students and their parents. Democrats led an effort to overhaul a citizen initiative on parental rights the Legislature approved last year. They said this was needed to clarify language in the earlier measure and align it with other federal and state laws. Republicans said it was an attempt to gut the initiative.
Wealth tax gets a vote
Progressives in the Senate got their long-awaited opportunity to argue for and pass legislation to tax the financial assets of wealthy individuals — knowing full well the bill would not reach the governor, who is not a fan.
The legislation to establish a wealth tax passed on a 26-21 vote. The House did not debate the bill.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, the bill’s sponsor, said taxing those with more than $50 million in certain assets like stocks and bonds “is constitutionally compliant and a sound policy,” a seeming swipe at Ferguson, who has questioned the novel tax’s ability to withstand a legal challenge.
Ferguson’s opposition forced Democrats to axe the wealth tax from their tax package.
“I think we have shown the people of Washington state what is possible,” Frame said. “I hope we will return to that soon.”
Solemn ending
This year’s session was enveloped in sadness.
Two political legends, former Secretary of State Ralph Munro, a Republican, and former House Speaker Frank Chopp, a Democrat, died days apart in late March.
Then, on April 19, Bill Ramos, a first-term Democratic state senator, died while on a run near his Issaquah home.
And Saturday afternoon, the wife of state Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, died following a medical emergency at her workplace.
On Sunday, senators honored Ramos in an hourlong, emotion-packed tribute as House members watched from the gallery. Ramos had served in the House before winning his Senate seat in November.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)A highly contested bill around the closure of a residential center for people with disabilities passed the Washington state House and Senate this weekend with mixed support from lawmakers and some major changes.  
Senate Bill 5393 intended to shutter Rainier School, a rehabilitation center in Pierce County for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, by June 30, 2027.
But a Republican amendment approved on the House floor, and agreed to by the Senate, will instead prohibit new long-term admissions starting July 27 this year and stop short-term admissions starting June 30, 2027.
Under the amended version, the center would close when there are no more long-term residents. Former long-term residents would have the ability to return within one year of transitioning out of the center. 
The rewrite gained some Republican support but lost some among Democrats. 
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, was one of the lawmakers concerned that the bill was rushing the closure and didn’t have enough safeguards. He and other GOP legislators walked out of a House committee hearing this week when the panel advanced the legislation. 
After the amendment, he felt better about the bill, even though he still voted against it.
“This is a pill I can swallow,” Couture said. 
The bill would also require the Department of Social and Health Services to provide regular reports to the Legislature until June 1, 2030, and offer residents the choice of alternative placements with careful planning. 
It now heads to Gov. Bob Ferguson’s desk. 
Debates around the closure of the Rainier School and the similar Yakima Valley School have been a hot topic in the Legislature this session.
Rainier School has faced scrutiny in recent years over incidents of abuse, neglect and safety lapses. Some disability rights advocates have pushed for its closure.
The facilities are also expensive, with a year of services for a patient at Rainier running around $775,000. Proponents of closing them said it could allow for resources to be shifted in a way that gives people improved options for services and reduces costs for the state.
“This isn’t about buildings or dollars, this is about the people who live at Rainier, people who have been hurt, forgotten, ignored, and betrayed,” said Rep. Darya Farivar, D-Seattle.
 “If home means fear, being silenced, bruised, and even death, we have an obligation to show some better options,” Farivar added.
But Republicans argued that centers like Rainier provide a crucial form of services and care and that people would be left with few nearby options if the center were to close. 
Workers at the facilities also opposed the closure plans.
In 2017, the Legislature passed a bill that would close the Yakima Valley School once the number of permanent residents had dwindled to eight people. There are roughly 36 long-term residents at the center, according to figures presented to lawmakers. 
A House bill that stalled this year proposed closing both the Rainier and Yakima Valley schools by June 30, 2027.

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Washington is poised to limit annual residential rent increases with legislation now headed to the governor’s desk.
The House and Senate on Sunday, the last day of the legislative session, passed the rent increase limit at 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. Landlords could still set rent however they please when a tenancy begins.
Rent increases for manufactured homes are limited to 5% under House Bill 1217. While the rent cap policy on traditional homes would expire after 15 years, the manufactured home rule wouldn’t lapse.
The final version was a compromise after moderate Democrats in the Senate wouldn’t go along with the initial 7% cap, without inflation, the House had approved. 
Landlords also couldn’t raise rents in the first year of a tenancy under the proposed law. If a landlord violates the provisions, tenants or the state attorney general could bring litigation.
Buildings owned by nonprofits or public housing authorities would be exempt from the limits. The same goes for duplexes, triplexes or fourplexes if the owner lives in one of the units, as well as new construction for its first dozen years.
Republicans argue the bill will chill development and price landlords out of the business. Most Democrats say it’ll give renters a modicum of predictability as they deal with the high cost of living. 
The Senate approved the bill on a 27-20 vote, with Democratic Sens. Annette Cleveland and Sharon Shewmake joining Republicans in opposition. The House vote was 54-44. Five Democratic representatives opposed the final bill. 
It was a long and windy road to Sunday’s votes.
After stalling in the Senate last year, lawmakers came into 2025 energized to enshrine House Bill 1217 into law. But after passing the House, the Senate, in dramatic fashion, lifted the cap from the initial 7% to 10% plus inflation and exempted many single-family homes entirely, moves advocates said “gutted” the proposal.
In negotiations, Democrats in both chambers agreed to excise the carveout and find a middle ground on the limit.
But when the new iteration landed on the Senate floor Friday night, lawmakers were thwarted by a procedural snafu that delayed votes a couple more days.
The compromise frustrated advocates, but they said it was better than nothing.
“Even a 7% rent increase will force some people to move, disrupting their lives and their communities, and some will have no option but to move into cars, shelters, or tents,” said Michele Thomas, of the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance. “But this bill makes a first step towards sensible protections against egregious predatory rent increases.”
Gov. Bob Ferguson has repeatedly declined to weigh in on the legislation. 
He told reporters Friday that he recognizes “the different perspectives that different folks within the caucuses have, and so we’re trying to be helpful on that and I feel optimistic that they’re going to work something out,” but stopped short of saying what he hoped that resolution would be.
Once the bill reaches his desk, Ferguson has 20 days, excluding Sundays, to act on it. If he signs, the policy would go into effect immediately.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_4915-Large-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-27 17:02:29.820883

You can read more about the section here.

Each year, in a handful of states, public offices close, flags are lowered and official ceremonies commemorate “Confederate Memorial Day.”
Mississippi is among those handful of states that on Monday will celebrate the holiday intended to honor the soldiers who fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War.
But let me be clear: celebrating Confederate Memorial Day is not only racist but is bad policy, bad governance and a deep stain on the values we claim to uphold today.
First, there is no separating the Confederacy from the defense of slavery and white supremacy. The Confederacy was not about “states’ rights” in the abstract; it was about the right to own human beings. Confederate leaders themselves made that clear.
Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens declared in his infamous “Cornerstone Speech” that the Confederacy was founded upon “the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man.” No amount of revisionist history can erase the fact that the Confederacy’s cause was fundamentally rooted in preserving racial subjugation.
To honor that cause with a state holiday is to glorify a rebellion against the United States fought to defend the indefensible. It is an insult to every citizen who believes in equality and freedom, and it is a cruel slap in the face to Black Americans, whose ancestors endured the horrors of slavery and generations of systemic discrimination that followed.
Beyond its moral bankruptcy, Confederate Memorial Day is simply bad public policy. Holidays are public statements of our values. They are moments when a state, through official sanction, tells its citizens: “This is what we believe is worthy of honor.” Keeping Confederate Memorial Day on the calendar sends a message that a government once committed to denying basic human rights should be celebrated.
That message is not just outdated — it is dangerous. It nurtures the roots of racism, fuels division and legitimizes extremist ideologies that threaten our democracy today.
Moreover, there are real economic and administrative costs to shutting down government offices for this purpose. In a time when states face budget constraints, workforce shortages and urgent civic challenges, it is absurd to prioritize paid time off to commemorate a failed and racist insurrection. Our taxpayer dollars should be used to advance justice, education, infrastructure and economic development — not to prop up a lost cause of hate.
If we truly believe in moving forward together as one people, we must stop clinging to symbols that represent treason, brutality and white supremacy. There is a legislative record that supports this move in a veto-proof majority changing the state Confederate flag in 2020. Taking Confederate Memorial Day off our official state holiday calendar is another necessary step toward a more inclusive and just society.
Mississippi had the largest population of enslaved individuals in 1865 and today has the highest percentage of Black residents in the United States. We should not honor the Confederacy or Confederate Memorial Day. We should replace it.
Replacing a racist holiday with one that celebrates emancipation underscores the state’s rich African American history and promotes a more inclusive understanding of its past. It would also align the state’s observances with national efforts to commemorate the end of slavery and the ongoing pursuit of equality.
I will continue my legislative efforts to replace Confederate Memorial Day as a state holiday with Juneteenth, which commemorates the freedom for America’s enslaved people.
It’s time to end Confederate Memorial Day once and for all.

As many parents will know, research points to several negative effects of screen time. As scholars who specialize in speech pathology and early childhood development, we are particularly interested in the recent finding that too much screen time is associated with less parent-child talk, such as fewer conversational turns between parents and children.
As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health Organization suggest limiting screen time for children. 
Beyond quantity, they also emphasize the quality of a child’s engagement with digital media. Used in moderation, certain kinds of media can have educational and social benefits for children – and even contribute to language development.
These tips may help parents structure and manage screen time more effectively.
 No. 1: Choose high-quality content

Parents can enhance their children’s screen-time value by choosing high-quality media – that is, content with educational benefit. PBS Kids has many popular shows, from “Nature Cat” to “Sid the Science Kid,” that would qualify as educational.
Two other elements contribute to the quality of screen time.
First, screen content should be age-appropriate – that is, parents should choose shows, apps and games that are specifically designed for young children. Using a resource such as Common Sense Media allows parents to check recommended ages for television shows, movies and apps.
Second, parents can look for shows that use evidence-based educational techniques, such as participatory cues. That’s when characters in shows break the “third wall” by directly talking to their young audience to prompt reflection, action or response. Research shows that children learn new words better when a show has participatory cues – perhaps because it encourages active engagement rather than passive viewing.
Many classic, high-quality television shows for young children feature participatory cues, including “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,” “Dora the Explorer,” “Go Diego Go!” and “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood.”
 No. 2: Join in on screen time

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents and children watch media together whenever possible.
This recommendation is based on the evidence that increased screen media use can reduce parent-child conversation. This, in turn, can affect language development. Intentionally discussing media content with children increases language exposure during screen time.
Parents may find the following joint media engagement strategies useful:

Press pause and ask questions.
Point out basic concepts, such as letters and colors.
Model more advanced language using a “think aloud” approach, such as, “That surprised me! I wonder what will happen next?”

 No. 3: Connect what’s on screen to real life

Learning from media is challenging for young children because their brains struggle to transfer information and ideas from screens to the real world. Children learn more from screen media, research shows, when the content connects to their real-life experiences.
To maximize the benefits of screen time, parents can help children connect what they are viewing with experiences they’ve had. For example, while watching content together, a parent might say, “They’re going to the zoo. Do you remember what we saw when we went to the zoo?”
This approach promotes language development and cognitive skills, including attention and memory. Children learn better with repeated exposure to words, so selecting media that relates to a child’s real-life experiences can help reinforce new vocabulary.
 No. 4: Enjoy screen-free times

Ensuring that a child’s day is filled with varied experiences, including periods that don’t involve screens, increases language exposure in children’s daily routines.
Two ideal screen-free times are mealtimes and bedtime. Mealtimes present opportunities for back-and-forth conversation with children, exposing them to a lot of language. Additionally, bedtime should be screen-free, as using screens near bedtime or having a TV in children’s bedrooms disrupts sleep.
Alternatively, devoting bedtime to reading children’s books accomplishes the dual goals of helping children wind down and creating a language-rich routine.
Having additional screen-free, one-on-one, parent-child play for at least 10 minutes at some other point in the day is good for young children. Parents can maximize the benefits of one-on-one play by letting their children decide what and how to play.
A parent’s role here is to follow their child’s lead, play along, give their child their full attention – so no phones for mom or dad, either – and provide language enrichment. They can do this by labeling toys, pointing out shapes, colors and sizes. It can also be done by describing activities – “You’re rolling the car across the floor” – and responding when their child speaks.
Parent-child playtime is also a great opportunity to extend interests from screen time. Including toys of your child’s favorite characters from the shows or movies they love in playtime transforms that enjoyment from screen time into learning.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Megan Cantone stumbled out of the hospital in tears from the pain.
She sought treatment for an infection from drug use. Medical professionals at the Denver hospital provided the treatment, but as Cantone recalls, it came with a heavy dose of judgment.
A doctor refused to numb her wound after recognizing it as being from illicit drug use, she said. The pain was supposed to convince her “never to shove a needle in your arm again,” Cantone said.

“I told my husband I feel like a complete failure, like a terrible person,” Cantone said. “That’s almost when a person could kill themselves because you’re at the lowest of your low and somebody treats you like that.”
Earlier that week, a nurse at a different hospital confronted her while treating another infection. The nurse told Cantone she’d end up killing herself and “pretty much told me I was disgusting,” Cantone remembers. 
Cantone began experimenting with drugs in high school, but her opioid use started when she attended cosmetology and esthiology school in the Twin Cities. Her use escalated to meth and heroin over the years.
A doctor stepped in to defend Cantone, scolding the nurse. The doctor suggested medication to help her stop opioid use; he said she suffered from a medical disorder that could be treated.
As the opioid epidemic continues in South Dakota, physicians can offer medications for opioid use disorder. But the practice — made possible by a change to federal law in 2022 — is held back in South Dakota because of stigmas attached to it, advocates say. Stigmas like Cantone experienced, and what she still experiences in South Dakota today.

Cantone didn’t accept the medication from the emergency room doctor. She grappled with self-loathing. But the doctor’s kindness and offer stuck with her.
Months later, after near-death experiences and the realization she was pregnant, Cantone accepted a prescription and delivered a healthy baby girl. The medication straightened a winding path toward recovery.
The 35-year-old mother and wife, who lives in Sioux Falls, credits her Christian faith and the medication for her recovery. She will celebrate six years of sobriety in May.
Training providers to ‘recognize bravery’
Buprenorphine prescriptions in South Dakota tripled in the last five years, increasing from about 2,500 at the start of 2019 to around 7,500 at the end of 2024. The drug reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings.
Naloxone is available in some public spaces throughout South Dakota, especially in Sioux Falls and Rapid City. It prevents opioid overdoses by blocking receptor cells.

Cantone took a Suboxone prescription for years, which is a drug that contains both buprenorphine and naloxone to treat opioid use disorder. Now she takes buprenorphine.
The increased access to both medications is heartening for Craig Uthe, a family physician at Sanford and local spokesman for the national Opioid Response Network. The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act eliminated a federal waiver requirement for prescribing buprenorphine. But physicians need more education on the prescriptions, he said.
“We didn’t have that many people prescribing buprenorphine before, and we still don’t,” Uthe said. “We have a lot of people still prescribing opioids but not prescribing buprenorphine.”
Opioids are prescribed for pain management but can be addictive, especially for patients with chronic pain, Uthe said. South Dakota opioid prescription counts in 2024 stood at 437,431.
Of the top 10 controlled substances prescribed to South Dakota patients in 2024, opioids claimed three spots, according to the state’s prescription drug monitoring program data. Two of the three drugs — methylphenidate and oxycodone — moved up in the rankings to fourth and sixth most prescribed controlled substances. Hydrocodone retained its number one spot.
The state and health systems are gathering data to measure how much buprenorphine is prescribed.
“If we see a county with high overdose numbers, we’d like to see a higher amount of buprenorphine prescribed,” Uthe said. “How can we, as the state Health Department or as health care systems, try to place a resource where there is the greatest need?”

South Dakota Health Department Secretary Melissa Magstadt said medical providers should make it a “prescribing habit” to prescribe naloxone for each opioid prescription they write. Overdose victims do not always suffer from opioid use disorder, she said.
“I’ve seen very well-meaning patients who took one too many doses or maybe forgot they took a dose or didn’t realize they had two different medications that had opioids in them,” Magstadt said.
She said it’ll likely take years for prescriber behaviors to change.
In 2023, South Dakota reported the second lowest overdose death rate in the nation at 11.2 deaths per 100,000 residents, according to the latest data available.
Ninety-five South Dakotans in 2023 died from drug overdoses, 47 of which were from opioids. In 2024, 90 South Dakotans died from drug overdoses, 36 of which were from opioids, according to the state Health Department.
Although most overdose deaths are among white residents, Native Americans are disproportionately affected. Native Americans die from overdoses at a rate of 26.6 per 100,000 — more than four times the rate among white South Dakotans, according to the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System.
Sioux Falls nonprofit Emily’s Hope partners with emergency departments. Physicians connect patients with the nonprofit, which works to connect them to medication and other treatment services, said Angela Kennecke, founder and CEO. Kennecke’s daughter, Emily, died of a fentanyl overdose, laced in heroin she injected. Her family was planning to enroll her into a treatment program when she died in May 2018.

Medication is the “gold star” for treatment, Kennecke said. Treating opioid use disorder without medication can be more harmful than no treatment, according to a Yale study published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal in 2024. 
“That is our first line of defense in getting people to feel better, to reduce cravings and get them the help they need,” Kennecke said.
Loretta Bryan, a registered nurse focused on clinical improvement within the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, educates medical providers on opioid use disorder, medications and how to engage with patients.
Her work focuses on “motivational interviewing techniques” to create authentic conversations with patients and improve screening.
“It takes a lot of bravery to walk through those doors and admit you’re struggling,” Bryan said. “Finding those words to recognize that bravery and having those in your back pocket is helpful.”
Expanding opioid use disorder treatment infrastructure
Access to medications for opioid use disorder is growing in clinics across the state, but not as fast as needed, Uthe said. The focus remains in emergency rooms and on harm reduction. Aside from clinics dedicated to behavioral health, Uthe said, family physicians and urgent care doctors should be comfortable prescribing the medications.
“We don’t have the infrastructure in place to address that need at the moment,” he said.
Lewis and Clark Behavioral Health Services in Yankton runs a telehealth behavioral health program focused on opioid use, with two outreach sites in Pierre and Huron. Rapid City-based Project Recovery is an addiction recovery clinic for opioids, alcohol and stimulant use with satellite clinics in Sioux Falls, Sisseton and Pine Ridge.

State funds to combat opioid use in the state support both programs.
Kendra Joswiak, clinical practice director at Project Recovery, said the organization treated 1,100 people for opioid use disorder in 2024. Of those treated without medication, about 90% will use again, she said, comparing medication for opioid use disorder to insulin for diabetes patients.
“If we had something as good for cancer as we do for opioid use disorder, we’d say we cured cancer,” Joswiak said.
Patients continue to face stigma after years of sobriety
Cantone continues to feel judged when she shares her history with medical professionals, pharmacists, friends and family.
She felt “icky” when she first ordered her prescription at a pharmacy when she moved back to South Dakota in 2020. Medication for opioid use disorder isn’t as common or well known in South Dakota as it is in Denver, she said.
“They looked at me like I was a drug addict or from Mars,” she recalled.
Friends and family have told her she’s switching one addiction for another. But medical professionals say the prescription drugs help restore balance to parts of the brain affected by addiction, allowing patients’ brains to heal without cravings or withdrawal symptoms.
The doubt and stigma undercut the pride and hard work it took to earn Cantone’s sobriety. But she knows people who struggle with substance use disorder are more than what others see.
“As much as we worry about what others think, what matters is you being healthy, getting your life together, staying alive and getting the help you need,” Cantone said. “Whether it’s medication or counseling or cutting cold turkey. You need to get yourself better and cancel out that noise.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/591A9544-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-27 13:08:37.307051

“I hated myself,” the 27-year-old Sioux Falls resident remembered.
He accepted medication from one of the nurses to stop the withdrawal symptoms. His head was clearer and he could fall asleep, but the shame remained.
Vanessa Needles entered the room after he woke up. She wasn’t a nurse, but a peer support specialist meant to connect Nielson to resources. His shame turned to embarrassment, but it soon became gratitude for the medical staff and Needles.
Needles spoke his language in a way the nurses and doctors surrounding him couldn’t. She overdosed once herself and struggled with alcohol use, eventually leading to a car crash that killed her coworker in 2017. Needles and Nielson started experimenting with drugs and alcohol around 14 years old. They’d both done things and treated their loved ones in ways they regret. He wasn’t alone.
Needles, who is seven years sober, offered Nielson grace. 
“When you’re trying to get off of it, the littlest thing makes the biggest difference,” Nielson told South Dakota Searchlight. “The most valuable thing is having someone understand what you’re going through.”

  Vanessa Needles is a 30-year-old Sioux Falls resident who works as a peer support specialist. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)

Needles is one of nine peer support specialists in eastern South Dakota with Sioux Falls-based nonprofit Emily’s Hope. Their work is part of a pilot program overseen by the state Department of Social Services and launched in January 2024 to reduce overdoses by providing “essential supports and strengthening connections” to local resources, according to a statement from the department. Rapid City-based Project Recovery piloted the program in western South Dakota.
The pilots are funded by national opioid settlement dollars, costing $346,445. The national opioid settlement was reached in 2021 to resolve opioid litigation against the country’s three largest pharmaceutical distributors and one manufacturer. More than $50 billion in settlement funds are being delivered to state and local governments from the companies accused of flooding communities with opioid painkillers even though they allegedly knew how addictive and deadly the drugs were. South Dakota is set to receive $54 million of settlement funding within the next two decades.
The department plans to continue funding the program with settlement dollars through 2029, based on a plan presented to the opioid advisory council in April.
What is the program?
The two organizations received a combined 34 referrals since the program’s launch and connected with 26 people to provide resources. Between 2016 and 2020, there were more than 2,400 drug-related hospitalizations and 684 drug-related deaths in South Dakota.
Angela Kennecke, founder and CEO of Emily’s Hope, said the organization works closely with emergency room departments for referrals. Sometimes the initial contact yields later results. One woman who ended communication with a peer support specialist last year picked communication back up this year to seek help.
“I always say a seed is planted,” Kennecke said. “Even if they don’t go into treatment immediately or they don’t go on medication and get the help they need, a seed has been planted that there is someone there to help them when they’re ready.”

  Emily’s Hope founder and CEO Angela Kennecke speaks at a press conference in Sioux Falls on April 25, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)

Kennecke’s daughter, Emily, died of a fentanyl overdose, laced in heroin she injected. Her family was planning to enroll her into a treatment program when she died in May 2018.
Project Recovery has found most of its success working with Rapid City’s Fusion Center, which is a law enforcement task force. The clinic receives referrals based on overdose data collected by law enforcement. Kendra Joswiak, clinical practice director at Project Recovery, said her response team connected with 82% of activations, 56% of which continue to be engaged in addiction service treatments.
Needles, a 30-year-old mother of two — soon to be three — served as a peer support specialist for years in other capacities before working with Emily’s Hope to meet with overdose victims in the emergency room. She’s previously talked with people struggling with substance use on the street, and she’s shared her story with jail inmates.
The program bridges gaps in South Dakota’s behavioral health infrastructure, she said. It also destigmatizes substance use within the medical profession and in the community, and gives a sense of purpose to those in recovery.
“By helping someone stay sober, I stay sober another day,” Needles said. “I can stand in front of them and tell them that this is scary and sh—y, but that it’s going to get better.”
Peer support specialists with Emily’s Hope receive a group text when an overdose victim arrives at a Sioux Falls-area hospital. Whoever is available goes, Needles said.
Most of the time, people have already checked out of the hospital before a specialist arrives. She remembers when she overdosed a decade ago, and she left the hospital as soon as she could because she was scared. She needed to cope with her emotions, and the only way she knew how was to use again.
She and other peer support specialists will follow up with patients after they leave the hospital, dropping off bags of fentanyl test strips or medication to prevent overdose. She’ll hand them to the patient, parents or spouses — whoever she can find.
‘Everybody deserves a little bit of grace’
After Nielson was admitted to the hospital and into a treatment program through Avera Health, Needles joined him each Friday. She checks in on him to see how he’s feeling and has taken him to support meetings since he completed treatment. She sent him a coin and card when he reached three months of sobriety late last year.

Nielson is eight months sober. He’s taking a Suboxone prescription to eliminate cravings, and he feels more like himself, he said. He started reading again, hasn’t missed a day of work and spends time with his 3-year-old son each week. It’s something he couldn’t have dreamed of a decade ago.
Needles’ guidance and support reminds Nielson he’s not alone and what he’s capable of achieving.
“Besides Vanessa, I don’t have another person to talk to regularly who knows what I’m going through or is sober,” Nielson said. “It can kind of get lonely after you cut off every friend you had, since they were all part of my addiction.”
One relationship isn’t a lot, but it’s a start, Needles said. She hopes as others learn about medications for opioid use disorder and about efforts to curb overdose deaths in the state, overdose response teams will be able to reach more people.
“Everybody deserves a little bit of grace,” Needles said. “We’re all struggling one way or another.”

Food security advocates in Iowa say the measures do not change much for the agencies administering the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
Luke Elzinga, policy and advocacy director for Des Moines Area Religious Council and chair of Iowa Hunger Coalition, said the memos are more about sending a message than creating policy changes. 
“The implication is that people on SNAP are not working, and that we have a bunch of undocumented immigrants on SNAP, and neither of those are true,” Elzinga said. 
SNAP rules require that anyone ages 16-59 work at least 30 hours per week, unless they have a physical or mental limitation, are a caretaker, receiving unemployment, participating in addiction treatment or studying at a school or training program.

Failure to comply with the work requirements could result in loss of SNAP eligibility for one month or longer. 
Further, able-bodied adults without dependents, or ABAWD, aged 18-54, have to complete additional work requirements, or else risk losing access to SNAP benefits for more than three months every three years. 
States may request waivers from the ABAWD requirements, which Rollins, as the secretary of Agriculture, has the authority to approve or deny. 
Rollins’ memorandum to state agencies asked them to “be mindful” of the law that created ABAWD requirements and its intent to “reduce dependence on public assistance programs and to support self-sufficiency.” 
The memo asks states to ensure their waiver requests apply “only to those who truly need it so that those who can work, do.” 
Elzinga said Iowa does not have any ABAWD waivers in place, so the announcement doesn’t have much impact on the state. 
In a press release about the memorandum, Rollins said states have “abused” the system by requesting work requirement waivers. 
“Today marks the start of a new era for SNAP—prioritizing work, career and technical education, and volunteering rather than idleness, excess spending, and misapplication of the law,” Rollins said in the statement. 
“Since my confirmation, I have reiterated the states are our partners, and this includes ensuring our nutrition programs are tied to putting Americans back to work.” 
Elzinga said enforcing work requirements would be effective at getting individuals to stop using the SNAP program, but not because they would be improving their overall economic well-being. 
“We should be supporting people and helping them have access to those (job training) programs, but not necessarily making them a condition of receiving food and health care,” Elzinga said.
On a local level, the Iowa Legislature and Gov. Kim Reynolds are pushing for expanded work requirements for Iowans to receive Medicaid or SNAP benefits.
Citizen status
The other memorandum instructed states to “carefully examine” their practices for verifying identity and immigration status, to ensure that “ineligible aliens” do not receive SNAP benefits. 
The benefits are only available to U.S. citizens and certain eligible “non-citizen groups” including: refugees, individuals granted asylum, entrants from specific countries like Haiti, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan and Micronesian islands. Non-citizen children under 18 are also eligible, as are residents with green cards, battered non-citizens and conditional entrants after meeting certain criteria. 
Elzinga said memo is a bit of a “nothing burger,” because “undocumented immigrants don’t receive SNAP.” 
“It’s not allowed by the program,” he said. “And we also know that it can be really difficult for legal immigrants who qualify for SNAP to even be able to get benefits.” 
Elzinga said the effort might have an impact by dissuading eligible immigrant families from applying for SNAP benefits, which he said agencies saw during the first Trump administration. 
“I do think this announcement could instill fear among mixed status households or even legal immigrants who qualify for SNAP,” he said, noting that folks might withdraw from the program out of fear that it would impact their immigration status.
The memo outlines processes that state agencies should follow to verify immigration status and eligibility, including the use of the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program which was recently made available to states at no cost. 
Elzinga said this would be the only real change to the state policy, because having access to the program for free could save agencies some money when running the service. 
The memo also encourages states to use other strategies, like surveys and in-person interviews to further verify identity and status of SNAP applicants. 
“We are stewards of taxpayer dollars, and it is our duty to ensure states confirm the identity and verify the immigration status of SNAP applicants,” Rollins said in a press release. “USDA’s nutrition programs are intended to support the most vulnerable Americans. To allow those who broke our laws by entering the United States illegally to receive these benefits is outrageous.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture press release cites a report from the Government Accountability Office that found in 2023, USDA paid about $10.5 billion in “improper” SNAP benefits. GAO listed failure to verify citizenship, identity, education, employment, finances, household size and residency as the top causes for improper payments. 
U.S. congressional leaders from Iowa introduced a bill earlier this session to similarly address the problems outlined in GAO study. 
Processing time
Rollins also sent a letter to state governors in early April, calling for improvements to SNAP application processing times. 
The program guidelines stipulate that applications are to be processed in 30 days for normal applications, but the letter said more than 30 states fail to meet that deadline. 
Iowa’s application processing timeliness was rated at 77% in 2023. Elzinga said the letter appears to be “a good thing” to help improve processing rates in Iowa and other states.
The SNAP program is also expected to be impacted by the $230 billion in cuts congressional leaders are tasked with making to the federal House Agriculture budget. Several funding programs that helped food banks purchase food have already been cut at the federal level, despite the fact that food pantries, at least in Iowa, are only seeing an increase in need. 
“No time is really a good time to be talking about SNAP cuts, but especially right now when we’re seeing this historic need … it’s just a really, I think, a really concerning time,”  Elzinga said.

Posted inFeatured
For nearly two weeks, Western New Mexico University’s website and digital systems have been held hostage by what officials in internal emails have called the efforts of a “foreign hacking group.” The university has not publicly addressed the severity of the attack, but documentation obtained by Searchlight New Mexico indicates that an infamous Russian-speaking hacking group is behind the attack and claims to have access to employee payroll data, Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses.

“If you refuse to communicate with us and we do not come to an agreement, your data will be reviewed and published on our blog,” the ransomware on WNMU employee computers says. “Data includes: Employees personal data, CVs, DL, SSN. Complete network map including credentials for local and remote services. Financial information including clients data, bills, budgets, annual reports.”

In an image of an employee’s computer shared with Searchlight, a note that threatens to leak the employee’s Social Security number, driver’s license and the university’s “complete network map” is signed by Qilin, a hacking group that the federal government has accused of running a “ransomware-as-a-service” operation. Qilin has earned a cutthroat reputation for being willing to go after anyone. Last year, it was accused of being involved in a cyberattack that forced a hospital system to cancel more than 1,000 appointments and operations. Earlier this year, it made headlines for its role in stealing the Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses of journalists who work for newspapers owned by Lee Enterprises.
Since April 13, the WNMU website has been inaccessible to the public. Faculty members told Searchlight that they and their students can use digital platforms like Canvas, which are hosted by a third party, but they’re unable to use classroom tools that connect to the internet, like printers or projectors.
In an image shared with Searchlight, one employee’s laptop screen displayed the same threatening ransomware message whenever they attempted to open a file on their work computer. The message was signed “Qilin,” and its contents bear the hallmark signs of ransomware, in which hackers hold sensitive data hostage until they receive a ransom payment. Even if they do receive a payment, groups like these may leak the sensitive information anyway.
A Western New Mexico employee’s laptop displayed several threatening ransomware messages, apparently signed by the foreign hacking group known as Qilin.
“We have downloaded compromising and sensitive data from your system/network. Our group cooperates with the mass media. If you refuse to communicate with us and we do not come to an agreement, your data will be reviewed and published on our blog,” the message says. “Data includes: Employees personal data, CVs, DL, SSN. Complete network map including credentials for local and remote services. Financial information including clients data, bills, budgets, annual reports.”
The note instructs recipients to download a Tor browser — commonly used to access the dark web — and visit a specific site to begin negotiations with the hackers. “You need cipher key/our decrypt software to restore your files … the police or authorities will not be able to help you get the cipher key. We encourage you to consider your decisions.”
 Payday delayed

On April 25 — a Friday, payday at WNMU — hourly and student employees said they had not yet received their direct deposits. In an email to employees reviewed by Searchlight, the university said the problem “stemmed from an unexpected complication during the file upload process to the bank” and said some employees might experience further delays in receiving the payments. “If this delay results in any overdraft fees, the university will reimburse those charges,” the email said.
The cyberattack comes at an inopportune time for university leaders, who are working to rebuild trust with the faculty senate, student body, state government and the surrounding Silver City community. Since December, when former university president Joseph Shepard resigned from his post and the governor demanded the resignations of the sitting regents, the campus has been without a permanent leader. New regents have only been on the job since late March, and now find themselves leading a university in disarray.
Threats like these have become common enough in local government that in 2022 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched the “State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program,” the first of its kind, to help upgrade and protect IT networks across the country. It awarded nearly $280 million in grant funding for fiscal year 2024 — nearly $4 million of which went to New Mexico — and anticipated awarding $1 billion over four years.
In an email to executive managers on April 14 — one day after the attack — Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs Jack Crocker said WNMU “experienced a cyberattack from a foreign hacking group” and said the university had the “ongoing collective support and assistance” of the New Mexico Higher Education Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and “other university cyber experts to help us combat the attack.”
In an email to Searchlight, Higher Education Department spokesperson Auriella Ortiz said the agency was working closely with the state Department of Information Technology to “evaluate” the issue.
“WNMU is undertaking a formal investigation to identify the scope of the incident and to facilitate necessary remediation efforts,” she wrote. “Our primary objective as state agencies is to support the university in restoring and continuing normal business operations following this incident.”
Whether that collective firepower will be enough to combat the hacking group remains to be seen. Qilin has developed a reputation for wreaking havoc wherever it goes. Last year, it was accused of being involved with an attack on a healthcare provider in London that forced hospitals to immediately halt operations. Qilin has been operational since 2022 and operates “ransomware as a service,” according to a 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This allows independent hackers to use its digital tools in exchange for a 15 to 20 percent share of the ransom payments. The 2024 report says that the group’s typical demand for ransom is $50,000 to $800,000.
“Actors practice double extortion and operate a data leak site where victims are posted. Victims are directed to communicate with the attackers via dark web portals or encrypted messaging services, ensuring the attackers’ anonymity and complicating law enforcement efforts to track interactions,” the HHS report says. “Payments are demanded in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Monero. However, even after payment, there is no guarantee that victims will receive the decryption tools required to recover their data.”
 System outage or cyberattack?

Meanwhile, the severity of the situation hasn’t come through in the school’s public messaging (“While select systems remain offline,” a recent WNMU Facebook post said, “key academic and communications platforms continue to be accessible.”) For nearly two weeks, WNMU’s website has been down and employees have had varying degrees of access to their emails. Everything on the university website — minutes and agendas for Board of Regents meetings, campus announcements and calendars of events — has been blocked from public view, and students have had to use alternative login methods to access online homework, lectures and exams.
In public social media posts and emails to students, the university has not blamed a cyberattack or other nefarious activity for leading to the outages. Instead it has simply said it is “working through technical issues.” Internal communications, however, show that the situation is more serious than the university’s public depictions.
The university has also enlisted the help of private cybersecurity companies. A number of Wi-Fi hotspots have been installed on campus and students have received instructions on alternative ways to access Canvas, an online coursework program used by universities around the nation.
“In the meantime, the plan is to keep campus open,” Crocker wrote in his email to managers. “Face-to-face classes will meet and alternative access to online/hybrid classes is being created. However, university internet, email, phones, and connections outside WNMU are inoperable at this time and must remain so until the issues are resolved. Scheduled events, such as the scholarship luncheon, softball games, Cultural Affairs lectures will continue.”
While faculty and hourly employees have received different communications from the top, students have seemingly been left in the dark as to the serious nature of the system outage.
In an email to students last week, the university made no mention of a cyberattack. Instead, it told students that WNMU “is currently addressing technical issues affecting access to several key web-based services.” It also told students that “protecting your personal data — including your student status — is a top priority.”
In a statement Friday, university spokesperson Mario Sanchez said “impacted individuals” would be notified if their personal information was involved in the attack.
“The university’s investigation into this incident is ongoing. If the investigation determines that personal information was involved, impacted individuals will be notified in accordance with applicable law. We understand there was an issue with payroll processing for the current pay period, but our bank has let us know that the issue has been corrected and payroll should be posted today.”

The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.

Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Du Bois called active resistance to racist policies.","April 27,  1903

W.E.B. Du Bois,  in his book, “The Souls of Black Folk,” called for active resistance to racist policies: “We have no right to sit silently by while the inevitable seeds are sown for a harvest of disaster to our children, black and white.” 
He described the tension between being Black and being an American: “One ever feels his twoness, — an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.” 
He criticized Washington’s “Atlanta Compromise” speech. Six years later, Du Bois helped found the NAACP and became the editor of its monthly magazine, The Crisis. He waged protests against the racist silent film “The Birth of a Nation” and against lynchings of Black Americans, detailing the 2,732 lynchings between 1884 and 1914. 
In 1921, he decried Harvard University’s decisions to ban Black students from the dormitories as an attempt to renew “the Anglo-Saxon cult, the worship of the Nordic totem, the disenfranchisement of Negro, Jew, Irishman, Italian, Hungarian, Asiatic and South Sea Islander — the world rule of Nordic white through brute force.” 
In 1929, he debated Lothrop Stoddard, a proponent of scientific racism, who also happened to belong to the Ku Klux Klan. The Chicago Defender’s front page headline read, “5,000 Cheer W.E.B. DuBois, Laugh at Lothrup Stoddard.” 
In 1949, the FBI began to investigate Du Bois as a “suspected Communist,” and he was indicted on trumped-up charges that he had acted as an agent of a foreign state and had failed to register. The government dropped the case after Albert Einstein volunteered to testify as a character witness. 
Despite the lack of conviction, the government confiscated his passport for eight years. In 1960, he recovered his passport and traveled to the newly created Republic of Ghana. Three years later, the U.S. government refused to renew his passport, so Du Bois became a citizen of Ghana. He died on Aug. 27, 1963, the eve of the March on Washington.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/06001414/April27-FeatImage-W.E.B._Du_Bois_by_James_E._Purdy_1907_cropped.jpg,,,2025-04-27 09:00:10.504609

When we encounter a setback or challenge, or even merely stagnation, it can be necessary to reflect on where our recent attentions and efforts have led us: toward a significant goal we have set, or away from it? Sometimes, we learn, we must make sacrifices for that aspiration, or discard it altogether for something that better aligns with our evolving values. But that spark that keeps us reaching skyward is ever-important – whatever our dream may be.

Addiction here is not some distant statistic; it's an unrelenting force that has a corrupting grip on neighbors, classmates and loved ones.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Benjamin Greenwood: Vermont’s drug crisis doesn’t stop at the city line.","This commentary is by Benjamin Greenwood, a third-year criminal justice student at Champlain College. He was born and raised in Richford, Vermont.I’m a Champlain College student born and raised in Richford, Vermont. Richford is a small town of approximately 2,000 people where, like most rural American towns, the opioid crisis has become a devastating part of everyday life. Addiction here is not some distant statistic; it’s an unrelenting force that has a corrupting grip on neighbors, classmates and loved ones. However, Vermont’s criminal justice policies somehow continue to view addiction as a moral failing or legal offense rather than what it is: a public health crisis. If we want to save towns like mine, we must stop criminalizing addiction and start prioritizing treatment and harm reduction. In 2022 alone, Vermont saw a record 243 opioid-related deaths. Although the drug problem in Burlington is great, we cannot continue to overlook the ever-present nightmare of drug abuse in small towns. Burlington and other urban areas continue to gain access to care and support, while in Richford, services are scarce, transportation is limited, and the stigma is deep. People who overdose here often do so alone, far from help.Despite this, Vermont leaders have continued to miss the chance to actually do something. In 2024, Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a bill that would have established an overdose prevention center in Burlington, calling it a “costly experiment.” The centers, which are successfully operating in New York City and other locations, provide controlled environments for substance use while medical staff monitor patients and provide safe equipment and emergency response during overdoses. These centers connect people to essential treatment and housing services while providing a vital link between the two. The veto was not just a setback for Burlington; it was a blow to every small town that might have benefited from the momentum. Vermont’s “Hub and Spoke” treatment system is often praised for combining medication-assisted treatment with counseling and primary care. It’s a strong foundation, but one that rural communities struggle to actually use. The system depends on physical access to hubs but in places like Richford, that often requires a car, gas money, and time off work, luxuries many residents simply can’t afford. If you live in rural Franklin County and need help, you’re likely facing long waitlists, overbooked providers or a long drive to the nearest clinic. All the while, the Vermont justice system still treats people with substance use issues as criminals who need to be punished by the full force of the law. In rural areas, we constantly rely on the police for drug-related issues because there is no one else around to call. The police are all we’ve got, and half of the time, it takes them way too long to respond. This reliance on the police leads to over-incarceration for things like drug possession or public intoxication; these actions solve nothing, and all they do is cause more harm.It doesn’t have to be this way, and it shouldn’t be this way; we have evidence-based alternatives. Harm reduction, including needle exchange programs, safe use spaces, and wide access to naloxone, has saved lives without enabling use. Drug courts and diversion programs have helped people get clean without the trauma of jail time. But these programs must be expanded equitably, so that rural residents have the same access as those in larger cities. Addiction is a health issue, and our response should reflect that. Towns like Richford don’t need more jail cells. We need mobile treatment vans, mental health providers, peer recovery coaches, and, most of all, funding not just in Burlington but in every small community hit hardest by this crisis.I’m not writing this because I have all the answers. I’m writing because I’ve seen what happens when nothing changes, when addiction is met with handcuffs instead of help. In Richford, we are tired, tired of being treated as statistics, tired of watching our town disappear one overdose at a time, and most of all, we are tired of losing people not just to drugs but to the silence that follows when the system refuses to care.

In a slightly warm classroom on a sunny April afternoon, five fifth graders loudly clapped their hands together or on their desks as they read a sentence out loud.
“Did” Clap. “She” Clap. “Wink” Clap. “At” Clap. “Hank” Clap.
With each clap, the students at Mark Twain School for Scholars in Detroit were distinguishing between the different sounds they were hearing with each word in the sentence, a common exercise in literacy lessons on phonological awareness.
They quickly moved to the next sentence, and Kimberly Sommerville, the academic interventionist who works closely with them to improve their literacy skills, immediately spotted a problem.
One student read the sentence, then the other four students were expected to say, and clap, what they heard. But the students were clearly hearing “A lot of junk is in the sink.”
“Listen,” Sommerville interrupted, then enunciated each word loudly for the group, helping them hear that the last word was supposed to be “tank” and not “sink.”
Scenes like this happen across the Detroit Public Schools Community District and are led by academic interventionists like Sommerville, whose work is a vital part of the district’s effort to improve academic achievement and get struggling students like the five in this classroom back on track. She is one of 600 such interventionists that the district employs. Their role existed before the pandemic, but the district has invested even more in them to address the learning loss students experienced during the public health crisis.
It’s “the best program ever,” Sommerville said, because of its strong focus on phonics and its use of the Orton Gillingham method, a popular approach to teaching reading. But she worries about its future because it partly benefits from federal education funds that are at risk of being cut. (Money from the settlement of a literacy lawsuit and a grant from the MacKenzie Scott Foundation also cover the cost of the academic interventionists.)
Sommerville has reason to worry, as do educators across Michigan whose schools rely on federal funding. The Republican-controlled Congress has signaled that it plans to substantially cut federal dollars for public schools. The Trump administration has threatened to withhold federal funding from schools if they allow transgender girls to participate in girls’ athletics — already, it has moved to strip Maine of its funding for refusing to comply. The administration also has threatened to withhold federal funding from states that don’t eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in schools. (Those efforts hit a legal roadblock Thursday.)
Republican proposals could affect Michigan students in myriad ways, from early childhood to tutoring to accessing school meals. Trump has proposed eliminating Head Start, a long-running early childhood program for children from low-income homes. Republican lawmakers have pitched changes to federal school meal programs that could leave hundreds of thousands of students in Michigan without crucial breakfasts and lunches. Deep cuts in the U.S. Department of Education, part of Trump’s efforts to eliminate the agency, have affected services for some of the most vulnerable children. Deep cuts in AmeriCorps could also be felt locally, particularly for a statewide tutoring program that helps students at about 80 schools in Michigan. And Trump’s tariffs could increase costs for school districts.
In Glen Lake Community Schools in northern Michigan’s Leelanau County, district officials fear the district could lose nearly $3.3 million in federal impact aid that it receives to offset the loss of property tax revenue from Sleeping Bear Dunes national lakeshore, which is located within the district’s boundaries. The impact aid provides operating funds for the district and makes up 20% of the district’s budget.
Glen Lake Superintendent Jason Misner said the proposed cut could be absorbed by the district’s healthy fund balance for the next school year. But there are limits to how far that rainy day money can go.
The uncertainty weighs on school district leaders who must build budgets for the 2025-26 school year by the end of June with little concrete information about how much federal funding they’ll receive, or if they’ll receive any. And teachers don’t know yet what potential cuts will mean for them in the classroom.
“Every day I’m scared,” said Janine Scott, a math lead teacher at Davis Aerospace Technical High School (and a member of Chalkbeat’s reader advisory board), during a recent panel discussion on teacher morale. “We have kids who rely on [federal funds].”
The unpredictability “creates anxiety, and anxiety within our school administration and support staff” creates more concern,” said Nick Ceglarek, superintendent of the Northwest Education Services, an intermediate school district that provides services to local schools in Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Kalkaska, and Leelanau counties. Many of those services, including some that provide direct instruction and help to students, rely on federal funding.
 There are few answers to anxious questions

On an evening in mid-March, more than 1,000 people logged into a virtual engagement session with DPSCD Superintendent Nikolai Vitti to hear about the potential cuts and their impact on the district. Those attending peppered Vitti with questions about whether nurses, central office staff, special education staff, and others would be affected. Some wondered if class sizes would rise, whether there would be funding for school lunches, and whether paraprofessionals could lose their jobs.
There were few concrete answers because so little is known about what might happen.
Federal funds touch many aspects of education. Among the most common: Title I funding helps schools provide support to students from low-income homes. Title II funding provides money for teacher training and other initiatives on effective instruction. Title III money invests in English language learners. Title IV supports programs that provide educational enrichment for students from low-income homes. Schools receive Medicaid reimbursements for some students’ special education services. And the federal school lunch program allows all students in a school with a large number of students from low-income homes to receive free school meals.
The stakes are particularly high for DPSCD, the state’s largest district, as about 32%, or $210 million, of its annual budget comes from federal funding. In the virtual session, Vitti shared how a 25% cut — which hasn’t been proposed but is something a national urban schools’ group has suggested might happen — would affect the district.
Whatever cuts happen, Vitti said the district might be OK for the next school year if it uses its fund balance and state funding increases at the level Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has proposed. Other strategies to address potential funding cuts include accelerating the closure of schools the district is currently phasing out, reducing discretionary funding, freezing vacant positions, decreasing operating costs, decreasing the frequency of technology refreshes, and reducing insurance coverage.
But he strongly urged those in attendance to reach out to state and federal lawmakers to share their concerns and ask them to fight back against the potential cuts.
“This current president and administration is not supportive of our children and our communities based on their budget. Budgets define your priorities, period,” Vitti told those in attendance.
The possibility of federal funding cuts was the talk of a recent superintendent’s meeting for the school districts that are part of the Northwest Education Services.
Like most intermediate school districts in Michigan, the agency provides a range of direct services to students. Ceglarek, the superintendent, said he’s particularly concerned about proposed cuts in Medicaid funding.
Ceglarek said schools rely heavily on Medicaid dollars to provide services to students from low-income households and students who have individualized education programs, or IEPs, which spell out what services schools are required by law to provide.
“When a student has an IEP, we are obligated as a district to ensure that plan is enacted and those services are provided, whether we get funding for it or not,” he said.
The ISD receives more than $2 million in Medicaid reimbursements, which is used to hire speech and language pathologists, psychologists, social workers, and physical therapists and then “deploy them into our local districts to provide these needed services.”
“It’s quite an efficient model,” Ceglarek said. “Many of our districts … don’t necessarily need a full-time speech pathologist. They may only need a half-time person.”
He has the same concern about any potential cuts to federal migrant student funding, because the ISD hires a specialist who travels among the districts and provides a range of services to English learners.
“Should those dollars be eliminated … That’s a scary proposition,” Ceglarek said.
 ‘You want your kids to do well in life

	.’
“Are you ready?” one girl standing at the front of the classroom at Detroit’s Mark Twain school said to her peers. When they all said yes, she began reading sounds such as “ing,” “sp,” “a,” and “wh.” With each sound, the students wrote what they were hearing onto a dry erase board then held it up when they were done.
After a few exercises led by Sommerville, she turned it over to her students to guide their peers. Having students lead an activity isn’t part of the academic intervention program, but it’s something Sommerville began doing because students expressed an interest.
“To me, they take ownership of the program,” Sommerville said. They do so well that when Sommerville’s coach visited her classroom two months ago, she joked that, “you’re not going to have a job.”
Sommerville is trying to remain hopeful that the Trump administration won’t make substantial cuts to education.
“I think he’s just being spiteful right now, but I don’t think he’ll do that. Because you want your kids to do very well in life. You really do, and that looks bad on him if you cut education. This is a representation of you, you know,” she said.

A little over a mile away from Mark Twain, at Ralph J. Bunche Elementary School in Ecorse Public Schools, similar literacy interventions were taking place as Marcie Gould, a tutor/interventionist, worked one-on-one with a struggling third grader.
After doing a warm up activity, Gould, who wore a black shirt with “literacy and justice for all” written in colorful letters, pulled out a set of small tiles and laid them out in front of the girl.
“We call these letter tiles so it helps the kids have a more hands-on experience,” Gould said of the tiles, each of which had different sounds that she moved around to create words and asked the student to read out loud.
The Ecorse district uses state early literacy grant dollars to pay for tutors like Gould from the Michigan Education Corps. But the program could still be affected by federal cuts. The Michigan Education Corps program is part of AmeriCorps, a federal initiative that has undergone significant cuts since Trump took office.
Ecorse Superintendent Josha Talison said that if any facet of the program had to be altered because of funding cuts, he would be concerned.
“Because the program has aided in the reading comprehension growth of our students since the program has been in place over the last five or six years,” he said.
Holly Windram, executive director of the Michigan program, said a continuing budget resolution Congress passed March 14 keeps their funding stable through the 2025-26 school year for the 80 or so schools that will use corps tutors. After that, there is uncertainty. Federal funding makes up 20% of its budget, and if that funding is cut for the 2026-27 school year, she’ll need to seek other sources of money.
“We financially have diversified funding. I’m concerned, but I’m not panicking financially at this point. My question is who are we going to get our money from,” Windram said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-04-27 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Jim Hood’s opinion provides a roadmap if lawmakers do the unthinkable and can’t pass a budget,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/27/jim-hoods-opinion-provides-a-roadmap-if-lawmakers-do-the-unthinkable-and-cant-pass-a-budget/,"An official opinion of the office of Attorney General Jim Hood issued in 2009 said if there is no budget passed by the Legislature, those services mandated in the Mississippi Constitution, such as a public education system, will continue.","On June 30, 2009, Sam Cameron, the then-executive director of the Mississippi Hospital Association, held a news conference in the Capitol rotunda to publicly take his whipping and accept his defeat.
Cameron urged House Democrats, who had sided with the Hospital Association, to accept the demands of Republican Gov. Haley Barbour to place an additional $90 million tax on the state’s hospitals to help fund Medicaid and prevent the very real possibility of the program and indeed much of state government being shut down when the new budget year began in a few hours. The impasse over Medicaid and the hospital tax had stopped all budget negotiations.
Barbour watched from a floor above as Cameron publicly admitted defeat. Cameron’s decision to swallow his pride was based on a simple equation. He told news reporters, scores of lobbyists and health care advocates who had set up camp in the Capitol as midnight on July 1 approached that, while he believed the tax would hurt Mississippi hospitals, not having a Medicaid budget would be much more harmful.
Just as in 2009, the Legislature ended the 2025 regular session earlier this month without a budget agreement and will have to come back in special session to adopt a budget before the new fiscal year begins on July 1. It is unlikely that the current budget rift between the House and Senate will be as dramatic as the 2009 standoff when it appeared only hours before the July 1 deadline that there would be no budget. But who knows what will result from the current standoff? After all, the current standoff in many ways seems to be more about political egos than policy differences on the budget.
The fight centers around multiple factors, including:

Whether legislation will be passed to allow sports betting outside of casinos.
Whether the Senate will agree to a massive projects bill to fund local projects throughout the state.
Whether leaders will overcome hard feelings between the two chambers caused by the House’s hasty final passage of a Senate tax cut bill filled with typos that altered the intent of the bill without giving the Senate an opportunity to fix the mistakes.
Whether members would work on a weekend at the end of the session. The Senate wanted to, the House did not.

It is difficult to think any of those issues will rise to the ultimate level of preventing the final passage of a budget when push comes to shove.
But who knows? What we do know is that the impasse in 2009 created a guideline of what could happen if a budget is not passed.
It is likely that parts, though not all, of state government will shut down if the Legislature does the unthinkable and does not pass a budget for the new fiscal year beginning July 1.
An official opinion of the office of Attorney General Jim Hood issued in 2009 said if there is no budget passed by the Legislature, those services mandated in the Mississippi Constitution, such as a public education system, will continue.
According to the Hood opinion, other entities, such as the state’s debt, and court and federal mandates, also would be funded. But it is likely that there will not be funds for Medicaid and many other programs, such as transportation and aspects of public safety that are not specifically listed in the Mississippi Constitution.
The Hood opinion reasoned that the Mississippi Constitution is the ultimate law of the state and must be adhered to even in the absence of legislative action. Other states have reached similar conclusions when their legislatures have failed to act, the AG’s opinion said.
As is often pointed out, the opinion of the attorney general does not carry the weight of law. It serves only as a guideline, though Gov. Tate Reeves has relied on the 2009 opinion even though it was written by the staff of Hood, who was Reeves’ opponent in the contentious 2019 gubernatorial campaign.
But if the unthinkable ever occurs and the Legislature goes too far into a new fiscal year without adopting a budget, it most likely will be the courts — moreso than an AG’s opinion — that ultimately determine if and how state government operates.
In 2009 Sam Cameron did not want to see what would happen if a budget was not adopted. It also is likely that current political leaders do not want to see the results of not having a budget passed before July 1 of this year.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/07000813/MG_6720-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-27 07:59:10.165668

Now he’s part of the solution..","Justin Johnston, a recovery specialist with the Brattleboro Police Department, stands in front of a downtown mural. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerAsk Justin Johnston why he recently joined the support staff of the Brattleboro Police Department and he’ll rewind some quarter of a century to the day its officers took him into custody at age 11.Johnston was 3 when his father died, leaving his mother to juggle two jobs, two children and an unwanted yet unrelenting dependence on alcohol. Finding himself uprooted from Florida to Ohio to Vermont, the schoolboy arrived in Brattleboro to his first stirrings of adolescence — and, feeling lonely and lost, sparks of anger.“My mom had called the police because I was out of control,” the now 39-year-old recalls. “I picked up some object and went to throw it at the wall.”What he hurled he can’t remember. The fact it hit her he can’t forget.Johnston marked his 12th birthday in the first of several foster and group homes.“I started smoking weed,” he says today, “and eventually, you do it so much, you have to find a way and a means to get it.”Johnston befriended and began working with drug dealers. At 17, he was convicted and jailed for selling crack cocaine. He’d graduate high school at Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield, then move in and out of prisons in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Kentucky. Arrested for dealing heroin just before turning 30, he finally landed in a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania.Johnston can detail every moment of his descent into drugs and despair. But now sober for a decade, the newly hired recovery specialist for the police department’s Brattleboro Resource Assistance Team would rather share how he — and others — can rise above.‘What’s wrong with me?’Johnston never had an easy childhood, which went from bad to worse when, as an elementary schooler, he discovered the truth about his father.“For most of my life, I had thought he died in a car accident,” he recalls. “And then I found an article in my mom’s bedroom and learned that it was by suicide.”The resulting questions swarmed Johnston as if he had struck a hornet’s nest.“Why didn’t he love us enough to not do this?” he remembers thinking. “What’s wrong with me?”With his mother often away working a double shift, Johnston had few people other than his younger sister to ask. And so he sought validation from other boys in their rough-and-tumble neighborhood.“I might not have a car or a big house with a swimming pool or ever invite you on a family vacation, but I can show up at the party with alcohol, I can get you marijuana, I can get you mushrooms,” he recalls thinking. “I wanted to show that I had something to offer, that I could fit in, that I could run with the crowd.”And from himself.“It might have started with fun,” he says, “but it eventually became a way to numb myself, to just ignore the world, to be lazy, to ignore responsibilities and what my future might look like.”Justin Johnston as pictured in 2022 at his past job as a recovery counselor at Turning Point of Windham County. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger‘It never felt like a real punishment’At 17, Johnston was convicted of a felony drug charge and incarcerated a half-hour north of Brattleboro in Springfield.“It never felt like a real punishment that was deterring me from making bad decisions,” he says of his years in state prison, “because I was around all of my friends, hanging out, playing cards, eating food, watching sports.”Industrious, Johnston also sold tobacco and unnamed “illegal substances” and ran sports betting and gambling operations “to keep me surviving and sometimes living so well I was sending my mother money.”Returning home, Johnston met his partner, Deidre, who later became pregnant. He was at her last prenatal appointment when, on the run from probation and parole, he was seized and sent back to jail before his daughter’s birth in 2009.Johnston boomeranged in and out of prison, all while banking up to six figures dealing drugs. By 2011, someone invited him to try a few blueberries — not the fruit, but the street name for oxycodone pills. They melted his pain like hot cobbler with ice cream.Johnston began seeking and selling opioids locally, not knowing an aggressive marketing push by pharmaceutical companies was leading to a rise in substance use disorders and overdoses nationwide.‘I might as well do everything now’“I kept telling myself, ‘I’m not a junkie, I’m not an addict, I’m just having fun, hanging out, this isn’t a big deal,’” Johnston recalls.Then news of an “opioid crisis” — former Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin dedicated his entire 2014 State-of-the-State address to the topic — sparked a clampdown in prescriptions.“I got to a breaking point where I could not find them anymore,” Johnston says. “I remember vividly sitting in a car with somebody who happened to say, ‘Well, I do have these bags …’”Johnston opened one and inhaled the heroin powder inside.“Maybe I can just do this a day or two until I find more oxy,” he thought amid a rush of pleasure.The backdraft hit seconds later.“I said to myself, ‘You’re doing heroin — your life’s over. I might as well do everything now.’”Sniffing that initial half-bag grew into snorting up to 100 bags of the drug a day. In between, he smoked crack cocaine morning to night.“Over time, the money I had saved up just dwindled down,” he says. “I lost the apartment, I sold my motorcycle, I crashed all my cars into trees or signs.”It was just the beginning — the beginning of the end.Justin Johnston checks messages with the help of his new rescue dog, Chase. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDigger‘A minnow in an ocean full of sharks’One evening in early 2014, Johnston was walking his dog when he passed out. Authorities, finding him and one of his drug stashes, sentenced him to 28 months at the Schuylkill Federal Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania.It was nothing like state detention.“I would have been known locally as one of the bigger dealers, so that can inflate your head and make you think you’re the man,” Johnston says. “Then I went to federal prison and realized I’m just a minnow in an ocean full of sharks.”One of his first Pennsylvania cellmates was a man with Mafia ties who was convicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, better known as RICO.“In for double life, plus 80 years,” Johnston recalls. “I’m meeting Mexican cartel members and blue-collar crime guys in a culture that forces people, out of survival, into being violent. That’s one thing I’m not. I desperately wanted to avoid prison politics and drugs so I didn’t end up in a maximum-security penitentiary. I thought, ‘How can I avoid going to the rec yard to fight a gang or race war?’” Johnston’s answer: Stop using drugs and stuff his day with classes. In a substance use course, he learned about post-acute withdrawal syndrome.“It started to make sense where all my emotions were coming from, why one day I just wanted to lash out and others I had a vision of a real future. My brain was healing. I said, ‘I’ve got to give myself some time to get through this.’”READ MORE





 


Addiction recovery centers ask for more state dollars as they face difficulty hiring, keeping workers

‘They had every reason to suspect’In the movies, a reformed inmate exits a dark cell into the blinding shine of promise and potential. But returning home in 2017, Johnston was enveloped by fear and cravings for a fix.Signing up for opioid dependence treatment at the Brattleboro Retreat, he met a volunteer peer coach who introduced him to the nearby Turning Point of Windham County recovery center.“I felt hope and safety and connection to people who understood me,” he says. “I could see a future. I could see brighter days.”Then that September, his sister died of an opiate overdose at age 28. “My mom and I sat with her as she took her last breath,” he recalls. “In that moment, I made a promise that I was going to do everything I possibly could to break this cycle. I didn’t know if I would really be able to keep it, but I knew every day I was going to try my hardest.”Johnston renewed the vow a year and a half later when his mother died of cancer at age 58. Going on to have a son with his partner, the father of two became a recovery counselor. He soon found himself working alongside the same police who once arrested him.“As a predicate felon who had no job history and had done very little positive at this point in my life, they had every reason to suspect I might go back to my old ways,” Johnston says.Instead, police hired him to serve as a community resource specialist under a new effort to put more social workers and unarmed support staff on the streets.“This young man has shown what can be accomplished by someone who can get their life together,” Brattleboro Police Chief Norma Hardy said at a recent town selectboard meeting.A decade clean from heroin, Johnston sums up his status: “Not selling dope, selling hope.” Justin Johnston leaves his business cards at emergency phones in Brattleboro. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDigger‘We need to change the norm’Today, Johnston works in a town where county records show a statistically higher rate of hospital visits for opioid overdoses compared to the rest of the state, according to the Vermont Department of Health.Caught between calls for a police crackdown and pleas for public compassion, Johnston wants the community to find common ground in the concept of “compassionate accountability.”Johnston demonstrates this strategy through his job. He talks with people struggling with substance use about treatment options, transports them to rehabilitation centers and connects them to social services as part of the town’s Project C.A.R.E. (Community Approach to Recovery and Engagement) — all with the understanding that continued illegal activity could lead to police action.“I think it’s more harmful to sit back and watch people die slowly,” he says, “versus help them be accountable to themselves and others for the best shot at a happy and healthy life.”That’s not always easy. Johnston notes several dueling challenges: How can society respect people’s autonomy to make their own decisions and, at the same time, recognize the fact addiction hijacks a brain? How can a community aim to help everyone as well as afford sufficient resources for sober living and co-occurring substance use and mental health conditions?“I support all pathways to recovery, including harm reduction,” he says, “but it’s unrealistic to think a majority will live a long, happy, healthy, dignified life sustaining daily fentanyl use.”For all his firsthand knowledge, Johnston is still learning. Take his recent introduction to college courses. One social service teacher extolled the benefits of evaluating clients through a formal and formulaic survey of their biopsychosocial history.“I found myself always challenging what was being taught,” he recalls. “Why would I ask somebody 80 questions in a row when I could have a conversation and get what I need out of a real connection? For too long, someone has sat across a desk and made you feel like they’re only there to diagnose and fix you, not to understand you, not to really listen to you, not to meet on that very human level. We need to change the norm.”He’s starting with himself.“I view recovery not as just being sober, but working every single day to show up for myself, my family and community, to be honest, to have integrity, to challenge my irrational thoughts and form new ones, all while recognizing I’m not perfect,” he says. “I’m going to have bad days. And when I do, I’m going to give myself some grace. If I can be hired by police, somebody might see that and think, ‘Maybe my past isn’t going to hold me back forever.’”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Once drug dependent and desperate, this Vermonter had a problem.

The Trump administration paused access to more than $16 million sent to Vermont through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Despite funding freeze, demand for EV chargers remains at mountain resorts.","Photo courtesy of the Community News ServiceOwen Evans is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship.As the ski season comes to a close, something that continues to be on the minds of mountain resort operators is electric vehicle charging. Since 2021, the number of electric vehicles registered in Vermont has more than doubled. The same can be said for Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey — where the highest number of out-of-state skiers in Vermont come from.Many of Vermont’s ski resorts already offer EV charging in their parking lots, including Killington Mountain Resort, which offers 47 chargers for guests, a total which leads the industry in the U.S. But many resorts either have limited charging options or lack chargers entirely, detracting from the guest experience. “I have power anxiety if the resort doesn’t have chargers,” said Joanna Whitcomb, a New Hampshire resident and frequent Vermont skier. “They’re well maintained but generally in use. More chargers are needed.”Beyond charger availability, other issues have been felt. “General courtesy from users, including staying at a charger when not necessarily needed, and not properly rehanging the cord and plug” are some of the challenges at Sugarbush Resort, said Margo Wade, director of planning.That can prove a problem in the winter, she said, when loose cords can get caught by plow trucks and send a charger out of service for weeks. “If the plug is not properly rehung and gets wet from snow or rain, it can short out the unit, which requires resort staff to dry and reset the unit,” Wade added.Molly Mahar, president of the Vermont Ski Areas Association, believes EV charging is something resorts will have to invest in if they haven’t already — and that they need to continue to invest in what they already have. “Ski area guests are early adopters of technology like EVs, and ski areas have seen more EV traffic and growing demand for charging infrastructure in recent years. It’s important that ski areas provide charging infrastructure to accommodate how their guests travel and encourage use of clean transportation,” Mahar said. “Transportation is a major source of Vermont’s carbon emissions, and we want to support guests’ use of EVs to travel to Vermont and to the ski areas.”Sugarbush, which currently offers 24 chargers divided among the Mt. Ellen and Lincoln Peak parking lots and the Claybrook Hotel garage, is looking to add to its existing infrastructure. “We hope to expand our EV charger program at the resort in the future,” said Wade. “Current limits to expansion include cost to upgrade/upsize electric service at specific locations and cost to purchase and install electric vehicle supply equipment.” Mahar said upgrades require investment from the state, too. “They have done a decent job with charging infrastructure. Another project was about to get underway to add more charging infrastructure using federal dollars, but this is now on hold due to cuts in federal spending,” she said.In February, the Trump administration paused access to more than $16 million in federal funding sent to Vermont’s Agency of Transportation through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. Andrew Wright, environmental policy manager for the agency, said one station already operating in Bradford will continue receiving funds. But in February, the agency suspended “four executed contracts and five awards” for additional charging installations, Wright said. The agency had directed funding to 11 charging station projects on the whole; the two contracted locations that were not suspended, in Randolph and Wilmington, will be paid for by state funds. The sidelined contracts and awards — as well as future ones — depend on moves at the federal level, Wright said.The ski industry is a significant part of Vermont’s economy. In 2023, the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis found outdoor recreation created $2.1 billion in value added for Vermont, accounting for 4.8% of Vermont’s gross domestic product. The highest economic contributor to Vermont’s outdoor sector was snow activities, including skiing and snowboarding, which contributed $220 million to Vermont’s GDP, up from $170 million in 2022. Across Vermont, there are over 490 charging stations with almost 1,300 total charging ports. A detailed map of every charger in the state can be found on the U.S. Department of Energy’s website. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Despite funding freeze, demand for EV chargers remains at mountain resorts.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ev-charger.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-27 06:59:17.924243

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied. 


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)On July 25, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a radio address to 125 million Americans in which he coined the term “first 100 days.” Today the 100th day of a presidency is considered as a benchmark to measure the early success or failure of a president.
Mr. Trump’s 100th day of office lands on April 30 where the world has witnessed his 137 executive orders, 39 proclamations, 36 memoranda, a few Cabinet meetings and numerous press briefings. In summary, Trump’s cabinet appointments and arbitrary, capricious, ad-hoc and erratic actions have created turmoil in the stock market, utter confusion among our international trade partners and confounded unrest with consumers, workers, small business owners and corporate CEOs. Interestingly, an April 17 UMass/YouGov poll found that 26 percent of the people who voted for Trump have lost “at least some” of their confidence and appeal for our 47th president.
It appears The New York Times was the first media agency to report on just the 18th day of Trump’s 2.0 presidency that he was creating a constitutional crisis. That claim has been reported in multiple major news agencies, spoken in town-hall meetings and observed in thousands of public protests with demonstrators from all political persuasions requesting Congress and the Supreme Court to stop our democracy turning into an authoritarian dictatorship.
On March 25, I sent an e-mail to authoritarian scholar Barbara McQuade (Professor – Univ. Michigan Law School; U.S. Attorney Eastern Michigan – 2010-2017; author: “Attack from within: How disinformation is sabotaging America) seeking her expert opinion on what citizens would most likely witness when a constitutional crisis has occurred and recommended action citizens should take.
Two days later, McQuade replied to my inquiry: “1) If a president were to deliberately violate a court order, I think we could consider that a constitutional crisis. 2) Citizens can do many things to push back against abuse of power, such as vote, write to their member of Congress or participate in a protest, but I think the most effective thing a citizen can do is to talk to their friends and neighbors to explain their concerns and rally support.”
Peter Wehner, Republican, who served as the speechwriter for three GOP administrations (i.e., Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) and senior fellow at Trinity Forum — an American faith-based non-profit Christian organization — feels Trump has created not one, not two, but three crisis situations. Wehner stated in an April 19-20 Wall Street Journal article “It seems as if we are moving at a rapid speed toward a genuine constitutional crisis, a genuine separation-of-powers crisis and a genuine checks-and-balanced crisis.”
You can decide if any of the following actions and published repercussions put America in a precarious dilemma:

Trump has openly defied federal court directives, refusing to halt deportation flights to El Salvador and return an illegally deported Maryland man.
Trump has eliminated and/or dismantled federal agencies – like USAID – by executive order, bypassing Congressional authority.
Trump has claimed the right to withhold or redirect federal funds appropriated by law, undermining Congress’s constitutional power of the purse.
Trump has fired civil service-protected employees, a violation of federal law.
Trump is attempting to end birthright citizenship by executive action, a constitutional right under the 14th
Trump has withheld funds from universities without legal justification.
Trump has revoked visas solely because of the holders’ expressed viewpoints, violating First Amendment protections.
Trump has attacked federal judges, questioning their legitimacy and authority, which erodes the independence of the judiciary.
Trump has created DOGE without Congressional approval, challenging the separation of powers.
Trump has set tariffs on our trading partners as opposed to Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution that grants Congress the explicit power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises” and to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.”

Polling by the revered and non-political Reuters/Ispos found 83 percent of Americans feel “Trump must obey federal court rulings even if he doesn’t want to”. Wall Street Journal polling has shown, “voters want to keep constitutional guardrails in place that constrain a president’s power” (April 4).
Keep in mind, as of April 24 there have been 211 legal challenges to Trump administration actions (Just Security – New York Univ. School of Law). Additionally, a probable Trump-related contempt of court opinion was issued by U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg which, if ordered, could lead to incarceration.
If you are concerned about Mr. Trump’s endeavors, consider the advice offered by law professor Barbara McQuade: participate in peaceful rallies, support political candidates committed to upholding constitutional democracy, communicate with your two Senators and Representative about your concerns and visit with friends about the trifecta crisis that is becoming more evident by political scientists, authoritarian scholars, constitutional law experts and registered voters like you and me.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-27 06:59:17.924243

(Getty Images)A Louisiana lawmaker says he wants to avoid the scenario that unfolded last year in Alabama, where clinics offering in vitro fertilization closed their doors rather than risk legal liability based on a new interpretation of a 19th century law.
The matter has pitted some conservative Republicans, who normally take the same side on reproductive health issues, against one another. It also provides a glimpse into the national debate over IVF, which proponents fear could be threatened under Trump administration policy. 
Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, received committee approval Tuesday for Senate Bill 156, which he said “is essential for IVF to continue in Louisiana.” But the proposal’s language had to be massaged to get the backing of one staunch anti-abortion lawmaker. Even then, the measure is still opposed by the state’s top two anti-abortion groups. 
Senate Health and Welfare Committee member Rick Edmonds, R-Baton Rouge, stood firm on making a change to the definition of embryo in Pressly’s proposal. As a state representative, he authored a 2016 law to prohibit abortions for genetic abnormalities. 
Originally, Pressly’s bill referred to an “in vitro fertilized human embryo” as one that “has certain rights granted by law … and organized that it may develop in utero into an unborn child.” Edmonds amended the proposal to define an embryo as “biologically human,” removing any reference to whether it actually develops into a child.

These seemingly subtle differences in language could become critical if its final version creates a situation similar to what happened last year in Alabama. Its state Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos outside the womb are considered children under the law, citing an 1872 statute that allows lawsuits for the wrongful death of a child. Fearing potential legal consequences from embryos that become nonviable – even through no fault of their own – IVF clinics in Alabama shut down.
The Alabama Legislature then scrambled to approve civil and criminal protections for IVF providers, leading clinics to reopen. There remain concerns, however, over whether long-term access will remain available. 
The Trump administration’s cuts to federal health care programs have served to reinforce such worries about the future of IVF. Staff reductions at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will curtail research into IVF and other fertility treatments, experts say. 
The changes have unfolded rapidly, even though Trump referred to himself as the “fertilization president” after signing an executive order last month to expand fertility treatment access. A separate order from Trump in February sought policy direction on IVF, yet Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency went ahead with the CDC attrition plans.

Anti-abortion groups back status quo
Louisiana Right to Life and Louisiana Family Forum oppose Pressly’s bill. Both groups were at the forefront of creating one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans three years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. The landmark 1973 opinion declared women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but it also said states could regulate when the procedure is allowed. With the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022, justices removed the federal right to an abortion and opened doors to outright state bans. 
During Tuesday’s committee hearing, Pressly insisted his proposal was essential to ensure IVF remains available to 1 in 6 families that struggle with infertility, citing numbers the World Health Organization has used. It has been nearly 40 years since Louisiana has updated its IVF statute, and health technology improvements in the interim need to be reflected in the law, the senator said.
Kathleen Benfield, legislative director with Louisiana Family Forum, told the committee the Pressly proposal is unnecessary because the state’s IVF law has never been challenged.  
“Not one example has been given where the practice of in vitro fertilization or any other artificial reproduction technology has been threatened (in Louisiana), and I don’t think it will be threatened,” Benfield said.
Even with Edmonds’ amendment, the bill’s language was still problematic for Benfield. She took issue with describing a “viable in vitro fertilized embryo” as a “juridical person,” or an entity that has the same rights in law as a person but is not a human being. 
Put another way, Pressly’s bill doesn’t go nearly far enough to treat embryos as children, according to Benfield. A juridical person is “not the same thing as a natural person,” she said.
Last year, anti-abortion forces pushed to change to an IVF protection bill Rep. Paula Davis, R-Baton Rouge, sponsored. She shelved her bill when rather than include the term “biological human beings” in it, fearing it could lead to criminal consequences for reproductive care providers.
Davis has authored another version of her bill this year, but it has yet to be scheduled for a House committee hearing in the lawmaking session that ends June 12.
Erica Inzina, policy director for Louisiana Right to Life, said the state’s current IVF law has room for improvement, but it still offers the most protection for human embryos of any state. Pressly’s bill would weaken those safeguards, she said.
“It leaves the embryo looking a lot more like a thing rather than a person,” Inzina told the committee.
‘We’re quibbling’
The proposed changes are the product of a rather unusual partnership: Pressly, who gained approval for a first-of-its-kind abortion drug restriction; and Katie Bliss, an attorney whose firm specializes in in vitro fertilization contracts.   
Pressly, who joined the Senate last year after four years as a state representative, authored a law in 2024 that treats mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances. Both medications are used in abortions but have other applications, including lifesaving ones. The Schedule IV status puts them on par with drugs that have addiction and abuse potential, meaning hospitals have to keep them under lock and key. 
Some health care providers have said the added layers of security for controlled dangerous substances put women’s lives at risk when, for example, misoprostol is needed immediately to stop postpartum hemorrhaging.
Bliss has two children conceived through IVF. She said the revisions to existing law are needed to protect patients and physicians while also ensuring care for embryos.
Louisiana is the only state that’s made the destruction of embryos illegal, and conservative lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully in the past to stop patients from shipping embryos out of state for disposal. Such measures are unconstitutional, Bliss said, because one state can’t tell another state how to conduct business. 
Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, attempted last year to end embryo transports across state lines, but the amendment he tried to attach to another lawmaker’s bill was ruled irrelevant to the original proposal and therefore was not allowed.
Pressly said his bill covers this scenario because it would make any IVF contract null and void if it includes a provision for the intentional destruction of an embryo.
Edmonds also objected to the removal of the terms “married couple” and “parental” from a section of existing IVF law that deals with embryo donations. Instead, “person” is used to describe an embryo donor and recipient. 
Pressly told Edmonds keeping “couple” in the law could create constitutional issues, implying it conveys bias against single people who want to start a family through IVF.
“It would be hypocritical for me to vote for a bill that would eliminate parental rights,” Edmonds said, though Pressly assured him his proposal doesn’t pose that threat.
Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, shared with other committee members that she personally had a “horrible history of miscarriages” and feared her children would have the same difficulty. Through IVF, her son and daughter-in-law have given her three of her eight grandchildren.
Mizell said she had “a hard time finding obstacles” in a bill that gives more people the opportunity to start and grow families. 
“I’m listening to pro-life people argue with pro-life people,” Mizell said, who then recounted efforts during her nine years in the Senate to put strict abortion laws in place. As a result, she said Louisiana has the strongest anti-abortion laws in the nation. 
“… We’re there and we’re quibbling” over language to protect IVF, she said.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Earlier this month, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Collaborative processes structured to include the needs and expertise of citizens can lead to sustainable and effective outcomes when paired with clear policy goals, firm process constraints, and effective leadership. 
The post Abundance with input: We can build housing and energy systems without ignoring community concerns appeared first on CommonWealth Be[...]","In their new book Abundance, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson make the case that laws and regulations designed to block the government and private sector from doing bad things have now made it far too expensive to do good things, especially to build what we need the most: housing and clean energy. They put the challenge starkly: “Changing the processes that make building and inventing so hard now requires confrontations with whether the systems liberals have built really reflect the ends they’ve sought.”   As public policy mediators, we share Klein and Thompson’s view that there is a need to reform unbalanced approaches to public input, requirements for many agencies to sign off on the same project with a myriad of permits, and legal challenges that focus on procedure rather than impacts.  But in our view, Klein and Thompson don’t spend enough time highlighting strategies that can work. We have been working for more than 30 years in Massachusetts and across the United States with government agencies, communities, and interest groups. We know that collaborative processes structured to include the concerns, needs, and expertise of citizens can lead to wise, sustainable, and effective outcomes when paired with clear policy goals, firm process constraints, and effective leadership.   Massachusetts is a case in point. It’s a blue state with plenty of obstacles to development. But state and local government, housing and energy developers, and environmental and community advocates have begun serious work on reforms that can make it easier to build while still providing for meaningful community input. Experience here offers three practical lessons on getting to more abundant housing and energy supply while ensuring public input and influence.  The first is to set clear goals in legislation and agency policy, and to constrain the opportunity for excessive procedural and legal challenges to those goals. Elected officials must set the “what” — what change in the world we are trying to make — while communities should have a say in the “how” — how that change can come about. In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker and the Legislature passed the MBTA Communities Act, with quantified multi-family zoning requirements for each of the 177 communities served by the greater Boston transit system. The act also allowed each community flexibility to decide where to put multi-family zoning districts, enabling residents to draw on their local knowledge and experience to help shape the future of their community. Most of the designated MBTA communities have responded positively, using their planning boards, town meetings, and citizen input to find good sites and avoid places where multifamily housing would not be viable or desired. At the same time, the courts have made it clear that creating these multi-family districts is a mandate that all towns must meet.      The Healey Administration has gone further with two recent multi-stakeholder groups. The Housing Advisory Council has just produced the first statewide housing plan with a target of 220,000 new units of housing by 2035, allocated across the state. The Unlocking Housing Production Commission (whose work our organization facilitated) has recommended additional, state-wide reforms of zoning and other regulations to remove barriers to housing development, while still giving local communities a significant voice in deciding where those developments are sited.  Both of these bodies represented diverse interests in housing and started with the premise that the need for more housing is not up for debate. Both have the backing of the governor. Now the Legislature needs to decide how much further it wants to go in addressing state and local barriers to housing production while continuing to allow communities a role in development decisions.  The second step is to reduce the number of veto points in new infrastructure development while providing better public processes. For many years, the conventional wisdom was to engage local communities early and deeply in big development projects, aiming to meet as many of their concerns as possible, and then secure the necessary public permits. That approach has reached a dead-end in the face of overwhelming, politicized “not-in-my-backyard” opposition to almost any new infrastructure project in most of the country. Instead, legislators can consolidate infrastructure permitting at the state level, provide funding for meaningful community input, and then decide on larger scale projects – without an option for opponents to mount legal challenges on issues already decided by the permitting authority. These authorities must still take and respond to input from individual citizens, local governments, interest groups, and state agencies. But they should ultimately make decisions on issues that the stakeholders cannot resolve.   Michigan, Illinois, Massachusetts, and other states are heading in this direction with new state energy siting legislation. While this approach does constrain avenues for participation, it provides far more clarity, predictability, and accountability than the typically convoluted multi-stage, multi-agency infrastructure permitting process. With a more consolidated siting approach, citizens actually know where to go to make their case, instead of chasing multiple authorities and jurisdictions.  In Massachusetts, the Commission on Energy Infrastructure Siting and Permitting brought together representatives from state agencies, municipalities, electric utilities, agriculture, labor, and others to hammer out an approach to energy siting that would expedite and streamline permitting. The approach would also constrain the ability of local interests to stop energy projects of a certain scale that would benefit the commonwealth as a whole, while providing more technical and financial support for affected parties to participate in the process. The commission’s recommendations, themselves a collaborative effort, led to the 2024 Climate Bill codifying these recommendations in law.  Finally, we must avoid over-representing those whose main goal is to oppose new housing or infrastructure efforts. We can do so by making sure that those who have something to gain also have a place at the table and support for being there. For example, we can find ways to give voice to young people who are not currently residents of a community but would wish to live there; those who grew up in the community but were displaced by high housing costs; or the policemen, teachers, and firemen unable to live in the communities where they work. We can bring representatives of these groups into local advisory bodies, to balance the voices of those who resist change to their neighborhoods. To enable working families to participate, we can use social media, surveys, games, hands-on tools, and online meetings. When we need in-person meetings, we can hold them where these residents live and provide childcare stipends or on-site day care for parents.    As Massachusetts’ experience has begun to show, communities and states across the country can overcome the obstacles making life less affordable and restricting opportunities for change. As mediators and facilitators, we have seen that people can and will get creative to solve problems if they’re given a mandate to work together and help to seek common ground. Diverse groups representing all the key interests at stake can produce broadly supported recommendations for the elected leaders who will make final decisions. We now need to apply that insight systematically in our municipalities and our state — and across the country — to create the abundant housing and energy supplies we need for the next generation.   David Fairman and Patrick Field are senior mediators with Consensus Building Institute, a nonprofit that helps leaders solve complex problems.The post Abundance with input: We can build housing and energy systems without ignoring community concerns appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Development.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-27 05:57:34.235030

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio’s food banks are set to receive $7.5 million less in the state budget than they did last year. Some lawmakers quibble with calling that a cut, and there’s a logic to their argument. The additional funding was a one-time supplement, approved in 2023, while the state was flush with federal COVID relief dollars. Now, some argue, the economy is back on its feet, there are plenty of job openings, and it’s time for the state to dial back assistance programs.
But the people maintaining that safety net say the need is greater than it’s ever been.
Gardens, pantries and food banks: How Ohio tries to keep pace with hunger

There’s an echo of the 2024 presidential election in that disconnect. The economy might look good on paper, but many are still struggling to make ends meet. Housing costs are rising. Wages aren’t keeping up. Inflation rates have come down. Grocery bills haven’t.
People who work in the food assistance system regularly point out that when money is tight, food is the first place families cut back. You can’t reduce your rent or electric bills, but you might be able to save some money leaning on canned goods or mac and cheese.
The state budget maintains food banks’ core appropriation of about $24.5 million year. But Mike Hochron from the Mid-Ohio Food Collective explained that’s the same funding they received in 2019. Back then his organization fed about 50,000 families in Franklin County each month. Now it’s 100,000.
“I don’t know how you’re supposed to serve twice as many people with the same amount of resources,” he said. “It means being really creative. It means being really efficient, and it also means figuring out how to make do with less.”

Faith Fellowship in Circleville 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For a couple hours every Saturday, Pastor Susan Roark’s Faith Fellowship congregation runs a pop-up up food panty in an empty lot on Circleville’s Court Street. This is the front line of Ohio’s food assistance system. In communities all over the state, pantries provide households with groceries like meat, dairy, fruits, vegetables and grains.
An hour before they open, workers are lugging banana crates packed with food from a box truck and trailer. They’ve got a ring of folding tables steadily filling up with canned goods, produce and bread. A man pulls out a step stool to hang a large blue Faith Fellowship sign on the truck. Nearby a few workers are laying out used clothing.
There’s already a line of people waiting.
At one end of the lot there’s an old motor home. Inside Cecilia Seckman and Mary Martin are filling Styrofoam trays with food. This sets the Faith Fellowship pantry apart from many others. Visitors can pick up the typical panty basket, but they can also leave with a hot meal.
“We’re gonna have ham and potatoes, green beans, rolls, and cake,” Seckman says as she dips food out of a couple of crock pots. Tomorrow is Easter; a man from another church donated 17 hams.


The germ of Faith Fellowship’s pantry came from one of their congregants, William Michael Brown. He worked with a street ministry in nearby Chillicothe and wanted to bring the idea to Circleville.
“The Bible says you’re supposed to feed and clothe the needy,” Brown said matter of factly. “We all do what we’re supposed to do, it’s all trying to follow the Bible.”
He’s proud of how their effort has grown — “It’s just been a bloom,” he said — but the demand worries him a bit, too.

“I don’t know if it’s the wages, if it’s the cost of living, or what it is,” Brown said.
“They come from everywhere,” he added. “It’s a need.”
Eric and Ashley Wharton made the drive from Chillicothe. Eric said the pantry gives them some breathing room amid the rising cost of living. “I’m door dashing, but I’m barely surviving,” he said. Getting a hot meal on top of the pantry basket makes a huge impact for them.
“If you put the price on that, that’s $8-10 if we’re gonna go buy it,” he said. “So, I mean, that puts $10 back in my pocket that I can use for gas or use for something that’s a little bit more important.”
Talisha Myers said the extra meals take a lot of work off her plate.
“I have five kids, and then plus my father-in-law lives with us, so it’s like, it’s really hard,” she said. “We don’t qualify for food stamps or anything, because they say me and my husband make too much together.”
Roark’s congregation is only about 50 people, but they serve a couple hundred pantry visitors and give out about 250 meals each week. After only half an hour they’d given out 125 meals.
“I think the need is greater than our capacity to meet that,” she acknowledged. “And there are other organizations in town that are working to meet different needs, but all of us together still can’t meet the need.”

The Mid-Ohio Food Collective
Standing behind organizations like Faith Fellowship are the food banks. While pantries operate like a storefront, food banks serve as distribution centers. Ohio has regional 12 food banks, and with a 20-county footprint, the Mid-Ohio Food Collective is the largest.
“We’re sending food every day out as far as Steubenville — a three hour drive each direction,” Hochran explained. “So, whether that’s as far north as Marion, down south to Chillicothe and all the way out east to the West Virginia border, that’s all our territory.”
Mid-Ohio supplies food to more than 600 support organizations from a warehouse in Grove City. The building is the size of three football fields; think Costco but crawling with forklifts instead of shoppers looking for samples. Fully stocked, the warehouse can hold roughly 7 million pounds of food. But the goal, Hochran explained, is to move that stock out rapidly — sometimes the same day it arrives.
“Almost two thirds of what we distribute at Mid-Ohio is fresh food,” he said. To get produce out the door they proactively send out fresh food alongside the items pantries have ordered.
“We know you’re going to serve a couple hundred families today, that’s going to be about —make up a number — four pallets worth of fresh produce,” Hochran said. “We’ll pick from what we have and send out a good variety of it, because we don’t want this stuff sitting in our cooler for three days.”
A case in point is stacked up five feet tall on about twenty pallets.

“This is a good example of perfectly wholesome, delicious cabbage,” Ohio Association of Food Banks Executive Director Joree Novotny explained. “But it’s not going to have a retail market. It’s not up to size, up to snuff, in terms of what a retail customer is looking for and what our traditional grocers are looking for.”
That cabbage was purchased through an Ohio program helping farmers recoup their investment in produce that doesn’t quite make the grade for your local grocery store.
“So rather than see this all end up staying out in the fields or end up in a landfill, we’re able to bring it in at pennies on the pound,” Novotny added.
As she’s explaining that, forklifts are filing up and carrying away one pallet after another. While Hochron shows off a large display where they track delivery trucks in real time, more forklifts start unloading a new shipment. This time it’s pallets of yellow squash.

Statewide perspective
Novotny explains food banks around Ohio are getting squeezed in multiple ways. More people need their help, support programs are holding steady or rolling back and the money food banks have doesn’t go as far as it once did.
She points to seniors as an example. The Ohio Association of Food Banks estimates 70,000 Ohio seniors receive the minimum $23 benefit through SNAP, the federal food stamps program. But during the pandemic, the minimum SNAP benefit was more than $200. So where do they turn to make up the difference?
“Well, a good example, if you look right over here on these shelves,” Novotny said, “these are some of the raw products that come directly from the USDA for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which is a small but mighty program that food banks operate in Ohio.”
The problem is funding for that program has remained flat. The cost of groceries certainly has not.
“It’s a good sort of microcosm,” Novotny said, “of how that purchasing power that’s been more limited means less food for vulnerable people.”
Novotny said they’re seeing similar funding challenges at the state level. To explain their current circumstances, she reaches all the way back to the Great Recession. It took food banks a decade to settle at a “new normal” in 2019. At that point, she said, they were delivering take home groceries to about 850,000 times a quarter.
“Since then, putting all increases in need aside, if we were serving the same number of people today, we have significantly reduced purchasing power,” Novotny said. She noted the consumer price index for food has risen almost 24% in the last four years, and they’re not serving 850,000 households a quarter — they’re serving 1.4 million.
“We need some help,” she said, “to help adjust to that inflationary pressure.”
In their budget request, the Ohio Association of Food Banks asked for an inflation supplement of about $5 million on top of the $24.5 million they’ve been receiving since 2019. That request fell on deaf ears.
In February, House Finance chair, state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, predicted that his caucus would keep historical funding in the budget but “maintaining a level of funding that we had at the worst economic times we’ve had is just probably not gonna be what we do.” That prediction held.
Novotny insisted “we will always have some food to provide,” but with government support at the state and federal level standing still while prices rise and more families seek out support, something’s got to give.
“We are already lightening the load significantly to each person who’s coming to us for help,” she said.

Nearly 1 in 5 Connecticut lawmakers are also landlords, far outweighing the number of renters in the General Assembly, according to an analysis by The Connecticut Mirror of the most recent financial disclosure reports.
While the majority of the 187 members of the state’s Legislature are property owners, the CT Mirror’s review shows that 35, or 18.7% of lawmakers, are also landlords. In the United States, closer to 7% of the population are landlords.
There are only 19 legislators who reported not owning any property, meaning they most likely rent. About a third of Connecticut residents are tenants.
The most recently available forms reflect last year’s legislature, although there are only 22 freshman lawmakers this session. Only four of those who left were landlords, and two were renters. It’s not clear which of the freshmen lawmakers are landlords because their financial disclosure reports won’t be available until May.

The landlord-tenant relationship has been one of the chief concerns of the Housing Committee for the past several legislative sessions. In 2023, adjustments that expanded renter protections accounted for most of the Democrats’ signature housing bill.
The issues have also drawn some of the fiercest debate and most-attended public hearings of the past three legislative sessions, with meetings lasting into early mornings. 
While lawmakers hold mixed opinions about whether and to what degree a legislator’s status as a landlord affects public policy, lawmakers from both parties have cited their experiences as landlords during discussion on bills that would alter the landlord-tenant relationship. 
Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, a landlord and Housing Committee ranking member, said he considers his experience an asset.
“I’ve got significant amount of experience in this,” Sampson said. “My interest is completely on the side of making good public policy. I’m not picking a winner or loser in this situation. I want all sides to prevail, and that, in my view, is less government intervention.”
Sampson has historically opposed bills that are supported by tenant union members and tenants rights advocates, such as bills to reform eviction law and cap annual rent increases. 
Meanwhile, some lawmakers said their colleagues who are landlords are prioritizing personal income over Connecticut residents.
“I was taken back. I just didn’t think there would be so many landlords voting on issues, voting to put profits over people,” said Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London. Marx said she asked to be put on the committee because, in her experience as a home health care worker, she’s seen many people living in bad conditions.
“When I voted on housing issues, it’s through their lens. Those are the people that I’m thinking of,” she said, adding that she doesn’t believe many of her colleagues are thinking of renters.
Lawmakers rarely mention their experiences as renters during public debate on housing bills, according to longtime members of the Housing Committee and advocates.

Over the past couple of years, lawmakers have considered bills that would cap annual rent increases and another that would largely end no-fault evictions, which haven’t passed.
The evictions bill is back this session and passed the Housing Committee last month. It would end evictions that typically occur at the end of a lease for apartments with five or more units, if the renter has lived at the property for at least a year.
There is disagreement about whether this bill — and its amendments — is an example of pro-tenant or pro-landlord sentiment on the committee.
Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, pointed to the bill as a piece of pro-tenant legislation that has gotten attention over measures he thinks would be beneficial to landlords.
Marx said the fact that the bill also includes a caveat requiring a tenant to live at a property for a year before the protections kick in is an example of legislation that’s been watered down by landlords in the legislature.
Other lawmakers said the portions of the state’s tax code that benefit homeowners and a bill that would make it easier for police to quickly remove people from rental properties if they don’t have a lease are other examples of policies that prioritize property owners over renters. 
“If your financial interest depends on squeezing more rent out of the citizens of our state, then you’re not voting the way I think you should be voting,” Marx said. “Housing is a right. Everybody deserves stable housing, and everybody deserves a home.”
Financial disclosure forms
Lawmakers who own rental properties span across parties and chambers. Fourteen are Republicans, and 21 are Democrats. Nine are in the Senate, and 26 are in the House.
About 40% reported owning more than one property, including vacation homes and timeshares.
CT Mirror’s analysis classifies lawmakers who reported owning multiple properties and collecting rental income as landlords. CT Mirror also included lawmakers who report rental income, but their properties were listed as rentals on sites such as Zillow, and one who is a property manager.
Lawmakers who are involved in the real estate business or those who serve as attorneys for landlords are not classified as landlords in the CT Mirror analysis.
Lawmakers also varied widely in how thoroughly they filled out their financial disclosure forms. Some listed companies that own property but didn’t include the property on their forms, while others listed out each property and the income from that property individually. This could mean that there are rental properties that went unlisted on financial disclosure forms, in which case the CT Mirror’s analysis is an undercount.
Several lawmakers listed multiple properties in Connecticut but didn’t list rental income.

Advocates say the disproportionate number of landlords often means that tenants’ experiences don’t hold as much weight in public debate.
“There are so many conversations I’ve had with legislators where the first frame of reference is, ‘What I’m hearing from landlords,’ or, ‘My friend is a landlord,’ or ‘Myself as a landlord.’ Just anecdotally, that discourse is so often defaulting to a landlord perspective,” said Luke Melonakos-Harrison, vice president of the Connecticut Tenants Union.
State ethics rules require that lawmakers abstain from voting only if the legislation would disproportionately affect their business, compared to others in the industry. But advocates say public policy, particularly in the area of rental properties, is still shaped by the professional and financial goals of members of the General Assembly.
Advocacy groups that represent landlords and several legislators said they don’t think the impact is so obvious. They say state policy is usually more pro-tenant and that housing providers are best equipped as experts to craft policy.
The majority of landlords were also homeowners. For many legislators, it’s been years since they were last renters, and they might not know what it’s like to be a renter in today’s economy, advocates said.
“Much of the work that tenants have to do participating in the process is just providing a basic education of what it’s like to be a tenant,” Melonakos-Harrison said.

Shaped by personal experience
Connecticut has a part-time legislature, meaning the elected officials are typically either retired or hold other jobs because lawmakers only meet for part of the year. Several said they can’t help but be shaped by their experiences, and those experiences help color policy debate.
“I would love to see those folks take a little bit more of a step back and understand it from a holistic perspective,” said Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport. Felipe is one of few renters in the legislature. “But when you have personal experience, that personal experience is going to weigh in, and I think it might have overweighed itself in certain situations, but it’s kind of the name of the game.”
Felipe added that a lawmaker’s salary at a base of $40,000 annually makes it hard for people who work hourly jobs or don’t have passive income to run for office. He added that he hopes lawmakers understand that access to passive income isn’t the typical experience for Connecticut residents.
“You cannot support a family, or let alone yourself, on a legislator’s salary without some other income, whether it’s pension, retirement benefits, or a second job,” he said. “You have to figure out a way to pay the bills.”
Scott said he’d talked to many landlords in the legislature who have said they think the legislation is “going against them.”

Former Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Geoff Luxenberg, D-Manchester, said separating from personal experience often comes down to research. Lawmakers are barraged with sometimes hundreds of bills to consider and often don’t have time to research all the topics, he said.
That means they often lean on their own experiences, he said.
“When you’re lacking expertise in a certain area, as an elected official, I think there’s a tendency to rely on your values, your experiences, your life experiences, to shape how you might view a particular issue,” he said. “And that’s probably where it seeps in the most.” 
Luxenberg reported owning close to 60 properties — the most in the legislature — and draws rental income from most of them. He said his policy views have been shaped by the number of people who come to him desperate for housing.
“It’s like a harrowing front row seat to the most painful part of the housing crisis,” he said.
He added that it can go the other way — that lawmakers shape policy without an understanding of what it’s like to be a landlord. But he thinks it more frequently disadvantages tenants.
“It has been my experience, frequently, that policies that specifically help renters economically face a hurdle in the legislature, and I suspect part of that hurdle is a disconnect between the lived experience of legislators and the lived experience of extremely large number of people in Connecticut who are struggling to pay their rent,” he said.

Legislation proposed
Luxenberg said he’s proposed policy that would offer tax relief to renters, and the attempts have been shut down. Most housing-related tax relief programs for residents aim to encourage homeownership in an effort to help people build wealth.
But researchers have said this approach essentially rewards wealth, offering tax breaks on mortgage interest to people who are able to afford to purchase a home, while people who rent are left without much aid.
“All the benefits in the tax codes at every level of government are for ownership,” he said. “All the things we discuss expanding or increasing are about real estate ownership.”
Lawmakers and advocates also pointed to a bill from Rep. Minnie Gonzalez, D-Hartford, as one driven by her experience as a landlord. In her latest available financial disclosure form, Gonzalez, who is on the Housing Committee, reported that she owns three properties, including her own home.
She earned rental income from one, and her husband earned it from the other. During committee meetings, she’s talked frequently of an experience she described as a “nightmare.”
Gonzalez said she was driving by her rental home one night and saw that the lights were on, even though no one was supposed to be living there. She stopped by and found someone had moved in. 
It’s not clear why the person believed they had a right to be in the property, but Gonzalez says the person was squatting. It took her four hours to resolve it, and she’s since gotten out of the landlord business.
So, this session, she proposed a bill that would allow police to remove squatters from homes without going through a court eviction process.
“They’re not going to grow up, those people, they’re not going to have any responsibility at all,” Gonzalez said during a public hearing. “And it’s very hard to say, maybe very difficult for you to accept. Squatters are illegal, and it should be criminal, and they should be sent to jail.”
But attorneys, other Democrats and tenants rights advocates have raised concerns that the bill would violate due process. Some tenants say they have oral agreements with their landlords but nothing in writing, and it would be hard for police to decide who is telling the truth.
Rafie Podolsky, a longtime housing attorney, said the legal question isn’t whether breaking into a property is illegal but what to do in more complicated situations in which tenants don’t have a lease.
“There are also circumstances where people are living there on oral leases and do not have a single piece of paper that show that they are there with the landlord’s consent,” said Podolsky, during a public hearing. “And if a landlord says to the police, ‘I want this person out. I never agreed to this. Tell them to show you anything in writing,’ they may have nothing to show you, but it doesn’t resolve the question.”
The bill passed the Housing Committee 12-6, with several Democrats voting against it.
In response to the opposition, Gonzalez said in an interview that tenants should make sure they get written leases.
“We have to stop babysitting people,” she said in an interview. “We have to do what we’re supposed to do. Yes, let’s help people, if we have the way to help people, but allowing other people to go out there and take advantage? I don’t think it’s right.”

Eviction reform
Gonzalez also voted against the no-fault eviction bill and said in an interview that she doesn’t believe that there is a housing crisis. She often sees signs advertising apartments for rent or homes for sale, she said.
Data and research have shown that Connecticut lacks tens of thousands of units of housing that are affordable and available to its lowest-income renters and that thousands more across different socioeconomic lines are paying more than a third of their income to housing costs. Construction of new homes and availability of houses to purchase have also slowed.
Gonzalez said she thinks the issue isn’t related to supply but to rents that are too high. She favors capping annual rent increases, she said.
Marx said the no-fault eviction bill is an example of one that’s been watered down because of the perspective of landlords in the legislature.
“They watered down the affordable housing measures,” she said. “They watered down the tenants rights bills so that they don’t have any teeth, so that we really pass bills that just don’t do anything for the tenants, and life is just going to get harder for our lower and middle class citizens.”
The bill now includes a provision that says the protections against no-fault evictions don’t kick in until the tenant has lived at the property for a year. Marx says they should begin the moment a renter moves into a property.
The bill has been controversial, even within the Democratic party and among lawmakers who aren’t landlords.

Rep. Larry Butler, D-Waterbury, a former Housing Committee chair and current member, said he doesn’t think it’s a balanced bill that considers the needs of landlords. He voted against it in committee.
“The legislation is like using a hammer instead of using a scalpel, in my opinion,” Butler said. Butler owns his home but didn’t report any rental income or ownership of other properties. He said he was surprised to learn that so many of his colleagues are landlords because he hears about it infrequently.
Republicans have objected to the bill, saying it would violate landlords’ rights and could push people to leave the rental business, taking homes off the market. Sampson said in an interview that he’d heard from friends who are also landlords who say they’re considering giving up their business.
“It’s concerning to me that the Connecticut legislature and the majority seems to think that they have a right to tell people what to do with property that they own, that they worked for and paid for,” Sampson said.
Tenant rights advocates say the concerns are overblown and that the bill is simply an extension of rights that already exist for seniors and people with disabilities. Other states have similar laws and haven’t seen significant harms to their rental market, they say.
Melonakos-Harrison said he thinks the concerns of landlords are considered with more seriousness because lawmakers tend to interact more frequently with landlords than renters.
“People’s perspective on housing is very much shaped through the social networks that they’re in, by people who own property and make money off of property,” he said. “It’s rare to hear any lawmakers speak about the opposite perspective. Renter issues tend to be talked about as more of something that people are not personally familiar with in any meaningful way.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_402-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-27 05:00:55.227860

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Find yourself a patch of land away from city lights just about anywhere in Kansas, and you will hear them. Sit down on a good rock and wrap yourself in the cold and dark, especially during a new moon in winter, and they will eventually begin to yip, yowl and yap. Their cries will grow in intensity until you might think yourself surrounded, subject to imminent attack, although you are likely as safe on the prairie as in your own bed.
What just sent a thrill down your spine is the cacophonous song of the coyote. These “song dogs” are among nature’s best survivors, an adaptable omnivore that has been with us since at least the last ice age. They are present in every state except Hawaii, are blamed for killing farm livestock and snacking on suburban house pets, and have been the target of unsuccessful eradication attempts for the past 200 years.
The latest campaign in the war on coyotes came April 24, when the Kansas Wildlife and Parks Commission voted 5-2 to extend the night-vision hunting season from the current three months to seven.
During the meeting, held at Fall River in southeast Kansas, the commissioners acknowledged various conflicts over extending the season but declined a request from Wildlife and Parks secretary Chris Kennedy for more time to study the coyote problem.
The new season would be Sept. 1 to March 31, excluding some firearm deer seasons. Currently, the season is limited to January, February and March. The extended season would not take effect until after the new regulation passes statutory and legal review and is officially adopted.
Night vision hunters typically spend thousands of dollars in rifles, scopes, and thermal optics. Their gear resembles tactical military gear, and that may be part of the appeal. We’ll get to this Zero Dark Coyote pretend combat presently, just as we will recount the story of a coyote named Rattlesnake.
In places like Kansas, where the myth of the frontier seethes just below the cultural surface, the coyote is not just a predator but a living symbol of the dichotomous desire to both hold the wild and to tame it. For First Peoples, Coyote often represents the Trickster, the entity who alternately brings creation and chaos. For ranchers, the coyote is a profit-eating pest to be eliminated by any means available. For romantics, the animal represents wildness, rebellion and cunning survival. We see ourselves in the clever and grinning countenance of these nocturnal ramblers.
Coyotes have been watchers on many of my outdoor adventures, but my best memory comes from a night some years ago sleeping on a sandbar on the Arkansas River far below Wichita. I had been kayaking the river for a book project and, retiring to my tent after miles of paddling, the coyote yips seemed like the voices of old friends. Their night song spanned the centuries, at least in my imagination, to a time before the plow broke the plains.
From the moment white settlers came to Kansas, coyotes were targeted for extinction because of real and suspected depredations. Rabbits and mice are the primary foods for coyotes, but just about anything can become a meal of opportunity — garbage, crops, livestock, the occasional toy poodle. Coyotes generally don’t attack human beings, although when cornered or trapped they can be dangerous, just as any wild animal can.
In 1916, the Kansas Supreme Court took up the case of a coyote in a Wichita zoo that bit a child.
Four-year-old Bessie Hibbard had been taken by her parents to the zoo at Riverside Park, where she put her hands in a cage containing a coyote on display. The animal bit and scratched her hand and arm. Bessie’s father sued the city for negligence. The state Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and found in favor of the city, saying officers and agents of the city were not liable for damages while performing official duties. A dissenting justice, Judson West, said the coyote cage was a “most malignant and excuseless” nuisance which afforded zoological specimens the opportunity to “dine upon the children” of visitors.
I’m with West.
For decades, beginning around 1900, the state attempted to eradicate coyotes by poison, firearms and paying bounties on their hides. When I was a kid, I remember some of my friends getting $2 per pair of coyote ears, paid by the county. I was a hunter in my youth, and always in need of money, but I never shot a coyote. I have since given up hunting, believing it immoral to kill wild things for money or sport. Your results may vary.
Perhaps the biggest change in the state’s approach to coyote management was the result of one man, F. Robert Henderson, a specialist who worked 27 years for the Kansas State Cooperative Extension Service. Henderson, hired in 1968, educated livestock producers across the state about the myths and realities of coyote predation.
“Not all coyotes kill livestock,” Henderson said in his memoir, published in 2016. “It is a learned thing on the part of the coyote. … I found out that generally ranchers hate coyotes.”
He also learned that most people who set out to kill coyotes end up thinking that killing indiscriminately is not the answer. Instead, you have to eliminate those animals that have learned to kill livestock, and the best way to do that is by trapping.
In the 1970s, Henderson set out to make an educational movie about coyote control. Lacking funds, he used a Super 8 movie camera and wrote his own script. The star of the film was Rattlesnake, a coyote the Henderson family had raised as a pet — something, the author cautioned, that “is not a good idea for you or the coyote.”
Rattlesnake became the film’s star because he would attack livestock when given the opportunity, a drama Henderson created with the help of a local rancher. It all seems a little bloody now, but I think the point of the staged scene was to show Rattlesnake running away when a pickup truck approached. When the film was shown, Henderson recalled, “Kids would first feel sorry for the calf, then cheer when the coyote got away.”
Like the kids, Henderson’s sympathy was with the coyote.
“Wild animals do get into situations where they create losses and cause people to have loss and worry,” Henderson wrote. “This is true, always has been and probably always will be.”
The actual number of cases is likely far fewer than generally believed.
Henderson’s memoir, appropriately called “Coyotes Go to Heaven,” is a sprawling and folksy account of his life, and that of his wife, Karen, from 1933 to 2016. Henderson recounts, among other things, hunting with Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden and the influence of environmental ethicist Aldo Leopold on wildlife conservation.
Henderson died in 2024. He was 91.
I was thinking about Henderson as I reviewed the video stream of the Wildlife and Parks Commission voting to extend the night vision hunting season for coyotes. I hadn’t known much about Henderson until a few weeks ago, when a friend suggested I check out his work. I’m glad I did, because Henderson seemed like somebody I could have been friends with.
I don’t presume to know what Henderson would have thought about the expanded coyote season, but I can tell you I find it disturbing. The kit — night scopes, thermal optics, and typically an AR-15 style rifle — seem more suited to urban warfare than recreational hunting. I suspect that playing war is the point for some. I don’t mean this mockingly, but hunting requires skills that are also useful in combat, something that novelist, soldier, and big-game hunter Ernest Hemingway knew well. But for all his faults, Hemingway did his hunting in the light.
Coyotes are officially treated as a non-game species, according to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, but they are “regulated and managed” as furbearers. As a non-game species, they can be hunted during the day year-round, and there is no bag limit. In 2021, a three-month night vision hunting period was introduced, ending March 31. With a hunting license and a special $2.50 permit, hunters can use artificial light and thermal imaging equipment.
This year, 7,310 night vision permits were issued, according to Laura Rose Clawson, chief of public affairs for the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks.
“Coyotes are an important recreational species in Kansas,” Clawson said in an email. “About 30,000 hunters spend about 200,000 days total hunting coyotes in the state. Most of this is the result of traditional (non-night-vision) hunters and methods.”
Clawson said there were alternatives to hunting for controlling losses to predation, including penning livestock at night, removing carrion, having guard animals, and fencing.
“However, coyotes do sometimes prey on livestock,” she said, “and in those cases, lethal removal of the offending animal is often the most effective solution.”
About 4% of cattle losses and 11% of lamb losses were due to coyotes, she said, citing figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Trapping is an option, but that is also lethal. The animals are destroyed after being trapped because relocation isn’t viable.
In public hearings on the night-vision season held last month in El Dorado, Junction City and Hays, a total of 58 individuals attended. Thirty-eight were in favor of an expanded coyote night-vision season, Clawson said, while 10 were opposed. Another 10 were neutral or did not complete the survey.
“I’m concerned I don’t have as much biological data on the coyote population as I’d like to have,” Kennedy, the Wildlife and Parks secretary, said during Thursday’s meeting. He also wanted “to make sure we’re not hunting any wildlife population in the state to extinction.”
Kennedy suggested postponing the vote on extending the night vision season, but the commission proceeded. There was, however, some concern. One member expressed worry about how hunting is perceived by the public. Another acknowledged that previously a wildlife biologist had told the commission that even a yearlong season would likely have no effect on the coyote population. The discussion preceding the vote was largely about conflicts with other hunting seasons, the added burden on game wardens and other law enforcement, the best month to hunt coyotes (January) and the importance of night-vision coyote hunting to the state economy.
Guided night-vision hunts are a big business in Kansas, with operators charging up to $1,800 per night. The coyotes are lured in by electronic rabbit distress calls. The operators, of course, claim they are doing landowners a favor by killing the animals.
Perhaps. But I doubt the accelerated killing of coyotes will do much to deter livestock predation because it doesn’t target the offending animals. The animals killed by the night-vision hunters are being promised rabbit for dinner, not lamb. You don’t kill all dogs because some have learned how to get into the chicken coop.
Nature is indeed “red in tooth and claw,” as Alfred, Lord Tennyson poetically observed in 1849. But we shouldn’t be. Night-vision coyote hunting seems offensive in the same way as buffalo slaughters in the 1870s or rabbit clubbing during the Great Depression.
There must be a better way to control coyotes than shooting them.
Coyotes have expanded their range and tripled their numbers since the 1980s, but it’s not the fault of the animals. Humans created the opportunity by destroying habitat and by reducing the coyote’s chief rival, the wolf. The harder coyotes are hunted, either in calling contests like the ones held in Kismet or by night-vision seasons, the larger their litters.
They have learned to exploit our trash, our livestock, and the habitats we create. They have become America’s most successful predator because we have helped them become so.
As author Dan Flores noted in 2016’s “Coyote America: A Natural and Supernatural History,” their strength is their uncanny adaptability.
“In one of the myriad ways humans and coyotes eerily mimic one another,” Flores wrote, “like us coyotes are a cosmopolitan species, able to live in a remarkable range of habitats.”
The current night-vision campaign to control the coyote population, like past hunting efforts, is doomed to fail. It may provide recreation for those who like military-grade kit, but it is ultimately a pseudo war against ourselves.
I’m rooting for the coyotes.

Enjoying the view from the train is one of the perks of being car-free, and some parts of the ride are especially beautiful.


Traveling along the coast, especially east of New Haven (on Shore Line East or Amtrak) the water views are spectacular.  Even on the wetlands side, there’s often wildlife to be seen… egrets, ospreys and such.
Crossing the soon-to-be-replaced, 125-year-old Walk Bridge in Norwalk, there’s a nice view out to the water or into downtown South Norwalk.  Westport’s Saugatuck River Bridge (known as Saga) is also a delight.  Same thing in Greenwich crossing the Mianus River where a glimpse to the north brings back memories of the collapse of the I-95 bridge in 1983 that took three lives.
But my favorite part of the ride into New York City on Metro-North is between Portchester and New Rochelle, that nine-mile straight section of track that engineers call “The Raceway.” Running right alongside I-95, the trains used to have a speed limit of 80 mph, and they’d do it.
Is there anything more satisfying than whipping past drivers on that busy interstate, showing them that the train is a faster choice?  I’ve even been known to wave as we hurtle past.
Just south of Westchester County, as trains enter The Bronx (near Woodlawn), is where the New Haven and Harlem lines converge, complete with a soaring rail overpass.  Again, a great view for a railfan such as myself. 
Another favorite of mine is crossing the Harlem River into Manhattan as the trains traverse the Park Avenue Bridge.  There’s a great view of the city skyline and brief views down the avenues.
Some stations are also memorable, even when passed at high speed.  Just who was Greens Farms named after?  And just why doesn’t the stylish new Fairfield Metro station have a waiting room?  But special mention goes to Milford where the usual advertising posters on the platform have been replaced with huge photos of the beautiful town itself.  Nice promotion.
As nice as those views are, there’s much of the ride which is far less scenic.
The seemingly bombed out factories of Bridgeport hold such memories… and promise.  And Portchester’s old Lifesaver building, complete with its terracotta candies as ornamentation, remind us of the whimsy of architecture.
Railroads are built around business, and looking into the backside of industrial sites along the right of way ain’t exactly pretty.  Even in corporate office buildings, it’s funny how landlords spend so much adorning their street-facing façade but forget that thousands see only the backs of the building, covered with graffiti and neglect.
And much of the trackside, strewn with debris, old rail ties and rusting equipment, could also use some TLC.

(Ryan Berry for Washington State Standard)Unemployment benefits for striking workers are close to becoming law in Washington after a compromise proposal cleared the state House and Senate. 
Striking workers could expect to receive the benefits for up to six weeks under the legislation.
Senate Bill 5041 now awaits a signature from Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, who has remained silent on his position on the bill. 
Earlier in the legislative session, the Senate approved a 12-week limit on striking workers receiving the benefits, and the House approved four weeks. Typically, unemployment insurance is available for up to 26 weeks a year. 
Both chambers approved the six-week proposal on Friday.
“I think really the only changes to this are that it went to six weeks and I think it’s a nice compromise,” said the bill’s prime sponsor, Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane. 
Republicans still oppose the bill, arguing that it will encourage more workers to go on strike and ​​result in higher costs for businesses. 
“When you look at how this is going to work in a large, long-term strike, I think everybody’s going to pay at some level, and that just seems frankly unfair to me,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia. 
Workers would be eligible for unemployment benefits starting the second Sunday after a strike begins, plus a one-week waiting period. 
The benefits would also be extended to workers affected by an employer-initiated lockout, something labor advocates point to as a tactic businesses can use to put pressure on workers during contract negotiations.
Benefits would have to be repaid if a strike is determined to be prohibited by state or federal law. 
The bill would require the state’s Employment Security Department to submit annual reports to the Legislature with data on the prevalence of strikes in the state and the cost of benefits for striking workers for Washington’s unemployment insurance trust fund. 
If it becomes law, the bill would take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, and is set to expire Dec. 31, 2035.

(Washington State Department of Transportation)Washington lawmakers announced Saturday a $15.5 billion plan to pay for a wide range of transportation needs, from highway megaprojects to state ferries. 
It’s backed by the first gas tax increase in nearly a decade. The package is a jump from what is now expected to be a $13.2 billion transportation budget for the current biennium. 
More than a third of the new budget will pay for road improvements, with another almost $1.6 billion to spend on highway maintenance and road preservation. 
The bipartisan framework for the next two-year budget cycle that starts July 1 includes $895 million for new ferries, terminal improvements and vessel preservation, $1.1 billion for the removal of obstacles to fish migration and $312 million in rail investments and port electrification. 
The total funding included in Senate Bill 5161 is more than what the House had initially proposed, and less than the Senate’s plan. 
No workers would face furloughs. Initially, the Senate proposed 13 furlough days in fiscal year 2026 for many state transportation workers. 
As in the original House version, some road projects not already contracted would be paused, but many of the biggest would continue. 
“We’re keeping our promises on the core projects,” said Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds. “I think it’s been a very difficult process, but we’ve landed at a result that I think Washington is going to be proud of.”
A 6-cent boost to the gas tax will help the state keep its promises. This week, the state House and Senate approved raising or creating a bevy of taxes and fees, including the gas tax, shoveling an estimated $3.2 billion toward transportation over the next six years. The suite of new revenue now awaits action from Gov. Bob Ferguson, a first-term Democrat.
The revenue package received no Republican support in the House and five Republican votes in the Senate.
Funding transportation for the next biennium came with numerous challenges, including soaring costs for highway construction, state ferry replacements, and culvert removals. Languishing gas tax proceeds make up much of the state’s transportation revenue, and a warming planet is fueling moves toward more energy-efficient vehicles.
These problems left transportation with a $1 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget, growing to $8 billion over the next six years. Without new money, lawmakers warned of major projects left unfinished. 
Lawmakers have to balance the budget across four years.
“I don’t think there’s ever been a more challenging piece of legislation that we’ve worked through,” said Rep. Andrew Barkis, the top House Republican on transportation policy.
Negotiations between the House and Senate were made even more difficult by the gulf that separated their two initial proposals. For one, the Senate looked to eliminate half of the shortfall through a creative plan to move funding for the court-ordered removal of fish passage barriers to the construction budget. The House didn’t take up the idea.
The budget announcement comes on day 104 of the 105-day legislative session, so both chambers plan to pass it Sunday. 
The framework is dedicated to Sen. Bill Ramos, who worked on the transportation budget before his unexpected death last Saturday while on a trail run near his home in Issaquah.
“This has been a difficult process,” said Liias, the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. “Losing our friend a week ago and trying to write a budget while we were all heartbroken made a very difficult task almost impossible.”
Highways
The proposed money will keep on track some of the state’s behemoth highway undertakings, like the North Spokane Corridor, Puget Sound Gateway spanning King and Pierce counties and improvements on State Route 520 between Seattle and Redmond.
And $580 million is included for the new Interstate 5 Columbia River Bridge spanning Washington and Oregon. Lawmakers this session also approved authorizing the sale of $2.5 billion in bonds to help pay for the replacement. The bond bill now sits on Ferguson’s desk.
The bridge replacement will cost an estimated $5 billion to $7.5 billion. Permits are anticipated by 2026, and construction is projected to last until 2032.
Ferries
One of the many needs looming over budget writers this session was the transition to a hybrid-electric ferry fleet.
Ferguson, though, announced last month that the state would postpone conversions of the state’s largest vessels as Washington has struggled to keep enough ferries in service. The first conversion fell well behind schedule and ballooned in price.
State officials will likely reconsider the conversions after the FIFA World Cup next summer. 
Meanwhile, bids for five brand new hybrid-electric vessels are due next month. 
The proposed budget for this biennium includes $274 million for new ferry construction, $221 million for preservation of existing ferries and $151 million for terminal electrification.
Proceeds from carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act make up almost $1.4 billion of the total budget. That money would pay for $461 million for public transit, $316 million in active transportation projects, $230 million for ferries and $225 million for work on electrification and alternative fuels. 
And speaking of the World Cup, the budget includes $9 million in grants for public transit agencies to provide increased service during the tournament.
Fish
Washington state officials last year acknowledged they couldn’t meet the goal of opening up 90% of the habitat that culverts have long blocked by 2030. 
That benchmark came after a judge found the state violated tribes’ treaty fishing rights by installing poorly designed and maintained culverts, which carry water under roadways. So the state has to pay to correct these barriers that impede salmon and steelhead migration in western Washington. 
But like other transportation projects, this work has skyrocketed in cost, with some remaining endeavors facing price tags upward of $100 million. 
The state and tribes are entering mediation to figure out a new path forward that recognizes the state’s fiscal reality and the upstream and downstream barriers that would still block fish passage even after state culverts are removed. 
The state Senate had pushed a plan to borrow up to $5 billion to address the culvert shortfall. But the bipartisan proposal ran into opposition that doomed its chances this year, including from the governor.
Liias hopes lawmakers can revive the legislation, Senate Bill 5804, next year.
But for now, he called the $1.1 billion for this work a “good-faith step to show our tribal leaders we’re serious” as the state enters mediation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sr-520-bridge-montlake-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-26 22:04:15.362087

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Democrats in the Washington Legislature unveiled a budget deal Saturday that cuts spending and hikes taxes on thousands of businesses to maintain core public services and erase a projected multibillion-dollar shortfall.
The agreement hammered out by House and Senate budget writers does not tap the state’s emergency reserves or furlough state employees, as prior proposals this year suggested doing. It pays for new collective bargaining agreements for state workers and provides $100 million for law enforcement hiring sought by the governor.
Overall, it spends $77.8 billion in the two-year budget cycle that begins July 1, roughly 9% higher than the current biennium. When all the adding and subtracting is done, there’s $7.4 billion in new spending, officials said.
It will be teed up for votes in each chamber on Sunday, the last scheduled day of the 2025 session.
“We’ve worked diligently to write a budget that addresses the fiscal challenges that we have, and continues to fund the core services that the people of Washington expect us to fund, and they depend on,” said Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee.
“There are many reductions throughout the budget that are harmful, are going to be hard for people, and for agencies to implement,” she continued. “We’re all eyes wide open about that.”
Robinson was one of four Democrats on the conference committee reconciling differences between the spending plans passed by the Senate and House. Two Republican lawmakers on the panel have not been at the table for negotiations.
One of them, Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the budget leader for Senate Republicans, criticized the process, then voted against adopting the final product 
“It’s been developed in the back halls of Olympia, out of view of the public,” he said. “I honestly believe it brings shame on the Legislature for doing it this way.”
Overall, there aren’t many surprises as the blueprint tracks with major contours of what Democrats pushed through in each chamber. 
To balance, it depends on $4.3 billion from a combination of transfers from other accounts, plus a slate of new and higher taxes on businesses and services that will start taking effect this fall. Transfers, targeted cuts, and a money-saving maneuver involving pension funds are also needed to make ends meet.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, who is completing his first session, fared well. 
In his inaugural address, he threatened to veto any budget that did not have $100 million to help local governments hire more police. There’s exactly that amount. He also wanted the state’s rainy day fund left untouched, and it was.
Ferguson did not respond to the Standard’s request for comments on the budget.
Robinson and Rep. Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane, chair of the House Appropriations Committee and a conferee, declined to say if they thought Ferguson would sign the budget.
“I can just say that the Legislature, pending approval of this conference report, will have fulfilled its constitutional and statutory obligation,” Ormsby said.
Robinson added: “The executive branch is its own branch of government. I cannot predict nor do I know what they will choose to do.”
The ledger sheet
By law, the Legislature must adopt a budget that is balanced over four fiscal years. Practically speaking, the immediate concern is the next two-year fiscal cycle that begins July 1.
Under the deal, the state will spend $77.8 billion in that period and end with $225 million in its cash reserves and $2 billion stashed in the rainy day fund.
It contains $4.4 billion to maintain levels of services required under current law. One of the largest chunks of new spending is for education, with another $682 million for elementary and secondary schools. Most of it will go to districts for providing special education services, buying materials and paying expenses like utilities and insurance.
There are cuts throughout. One of the most painful for Democrats: delayed expansions planned under the Fair Start for Kids Act. The 2021 law expands and guarantees access to state-paid early learning programs and subsidized child care for families with lower household incomes. 
Under the law, the Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program is supposed to become an entitlement next year. It won’t. There will also be delays to broadened eligibility for the Working Connections Child Care Program. Increased reimbursement rates for providers will be pushed off as well.
A reprieve for state workers
Ferguson proposed furloughing state employees one day a month in the next budget cycle to save $300 million. Senate Democrats proposed 13 unpaid days off to save half as much. Senate Republicans wanted to not fund the recently brokered labor contracts, which include a 5% pay raise over two years, and instead give each worker a $5,000 bonus.
None of that is happening. Nearly a billion dollars is penciled in to cover the contracts.
“The state needs to be a model employer,” Ormsby said. “We need to project outward to the rest of the state what it looks like to appreciate the work that people do, compensate them fairly and keep them employed.”
Taxing matters
Democrats had designs for raising up to $21 billion from new and higher taxes in the next four fiscal years. Ferguson shook his head no. 
They went back to the drawing board and came up with a different approach projected to net $4.3 billion for the coming budget and $4.4 billion in the one after that. 
It would permanently boost the primary business and occupation tax rates. Sales tax would be applied to more services. New surcharges are coming for Washington companies with more than $250 million in annual revenue. Higher tax rates are in store for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in earnings. A few tax breaks disappear. And an existing tax gets broadened to include nicotine pouches, like Zyn.
Two gimmicks gone, one added
Democrats put forth two eye-rolling, money-moving maneuvers with their earlier budget proposals. They’re put away now.
One required certain companies to prepay a month’s worth of sales tax. The thinking was to get those dollars paid into the final month of the next budget cycle that would’ve otherwise been due in the first month of the following one. It would have been like creating a 25th month of collections.
The other idea was to change the timing and amounts of apportionment payments to school districts to push hundreds of millions of dollars in spending into the 2027-29 budget.
A new move involving the state’s pension funds is in. Senate Bill 5357 lets budget writers assume a greater return on dollars invested through the state’s pension accounts – 7.25% up from the 7% set by the Pension Funding Council in 2023.
Assuming the higher rate of return means that the state can meet its funding obligations for the pensions while contributing less money to them. But jacking up the rate also raises the risk of investments not meeting higher targets, and the plans gradually becoming underfunded. Washington is generally known for having healthy public employee pension plans.
In the next four years, the shift will allow the state to save about a billion dollars by making lower payments into its pension system.
Last word
“Affordability” is one of the session buzzwords. 
Republicans have argued new and higher taxes for the operating budget will drive up costs for “hard-working Washingtonians.” Gildon said the tax increases will equate to about $2,000 a year for a family of four.
Democrats contend the steps they are taking will bolster public schools and preserve access to critical services for the state’s most vulnerable residents.
Robinson said the budget is not the one “we thought we’d be writing a year ago. That’s the hard job of governing, trying to find the balance between funding the needs of our state, the services and programs that our people depend on and rely on, and finding ways to pay for it.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1629-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-26 21:00:17.577284

(Ian Stewart/Virginia Mercury)Roughly 150 people jammed a meeting room at the Twin Hickory Public Library in Henrico County Saturday, demanding U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, oppose sweeping federal spending cuts and immigration measures stemming from President Donald Trump’s administration. The event highlighted the scrutiny Wittman and other Virginia congressional representatives have faced for how they engage with people in their districts.
Wittman, who declined an invitation to the event, was represented by an empty chair at the front of the room. Many who spoke about their concerns addressed their comments to the chair.
Attendee Ericka Kopp pulled out a copy of the Constitution and read parts of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments that addressed her concerns about the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration reform policies.
Wittman, who has represented Virginia’s 1st Congressional District since 2007, supported executive orders Trump issued in January cracking down on illegal immigration to the United States and expanding federal agencies’ authority to identify and expel undocumented immigrants from the country. Wittman and other supporters framed the orders as a way to halt drugs and dangerous criminals from entering the country, while detractors said the policies unfairly target immigrants, limit due process and pull families apart.

Kopp said parts of the text do not refer to “citizens of this nation” but instead to “all people” as having a right to a fair trial for crimes, who can’t have their “life, liberty or property” deprived without due process of law. 
“Amendment Six, ‘the accused shall enjoy,’ again, not citizens – all ‘people,’” she said. “So Representative Wittman, I ask that you read the Constitution and apply it accordingly.”

Vietnam veteran Jim Kutz voiced his concerns about the administration’s recent arrest of a circuit court judge who was accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities. He addressed his question to the entire room.
“What other leader arrested judges?” he asked. “Hitler, Mussolini and other dictators arrested judges. I think we are all very concerned about the rule of law.” In pointed remarks directed at Wittman, Kutz said, “We want you to speak up on the floor and introduce resolutions supporting the rule of law and speak out about the appalling things that are happening in the White House.”
The event, dubbed “Where’s Wittman? A Town Hall In Absentia for Virginia’s First Congressional District,” was put on by Democracy Circle RVA, a group who started meeting after Trump’s second inauguration, said organizer Jenny Pribble. 
“We’re a group of friends and neighbors, a loose-knit organization,” she said. “A lot of us have experience in political organizing, but decided this time we wanted to be engaged very locally with our immediate neighbors. I think what unites us is a real concern about attacks on rule of law, attacks on democratic institutions, and challenges now with due process.”
The group also contrasted the administration’s action with the Fourteenth Amendment,  which identifies American citizens as “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” and declares that states shouldn’t deny “any person” due process of law and “equal protection of the laws.” 
“His job is to represent his constituents, and his constituents are showing up, and they would like him to listen,” said Pribble.

In an email to the Virginia Mercury ahead of Saturday’s town hall, Wittman’s communications director Julianne Heberlein said the congressman wasn’t planning on attending the event because it wasn’t organized by his office and because he was “already committed to several other events in the district that day.” 
Wittman also directly addressed the town hall organizers in the email, defending his record of engaging with constituents and tackling important issues.
“I’ve consistently hosted live telephone town halls, and I’m proud that my most recent one reached approximately 9,000 constituents,” he wrote. “We covered a range of topics — from Social Security and veterans’ issues to the economy — and I always welcome tough questions, even from those who disagree with me.”
On March 26, Wittman held a telephone town hall via Facebook that his office says drew 9000 people. The video on Facebook has since been removed. Callers had to register on Wittman’s website in order to be a part of the conversation. According to Heberlein, Wittman has hosted from three to seven telephone town halls per year since about 2009.
Wittman said the telephone town halls allow him to connect to thousands of residents in the district, which spans from parts of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield Counties in Central Virginia to parts of the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula. There are over 471,000 registered voters in the district, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Though he values meeting with people in person, Wittman said, he encourages people to sign up on his website for the next telephone town hall.
Democracy Circle RVA did meet with Wittman on March 14, where they hand delivered an invitation signed by 79 people. 
“When we met with Rob Whitman in person, we discussed a range of issues, and on a number of issues he seemed to agree with us,” said Pribble. “But he insisted that he didn’t have a lot of power to change things beyond voting for a budget or voting against a budget. But we know that Article I gives Congress a lot of powers of oversight, of investigation.”
According to VoteSmart, a nonpartisan website compiling information on candidates and elected officials, Wittman’s recent voting record shows he voted in favor of Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a bill that requires individuals to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. He has also voted “yea” to several measures designed to enhance security as the country’s southern border. In his March video town hall, Wittman also supported sweeping federal spending cuts. 
“We have $1.7 trillion of a deficit this year, and $36 trillion of debt for the nation,” Wittman said. “That’s on the backs of our children and our children’s children,” the Daily Press reported.
Pribble said the town hall, where state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, was also in attendance, was recorded and will be shared with Whittman’s office.
“He needs to hear from his constituents about how this moment is shaping families’ lives. We have a lot of federal workers in this district. They’ve been hit hard, and I think Whitman needs to show up and hear from us,” said Pribble.

(Luke Sharrett/Getty Images)More states are enacting bans on “Glock switches,” small devices about the size of a U.S. quarter that can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons capable of firing up to 1,200 rounds per minute.
Gun conversion devices have become a rare point of bipartisan agreement on gun policy. Although firearm regulations often face pushback in Republican-led states, growing support from local law enforcement officials has helped these bans gain traction.
Last month, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears. A sear is the part of the gun that holds the hammer or firing pin back until the trigger is pulled.
“While there is a federal ban on these gun conversion devices, we needed a way to empower our own law enforcement here in Alabama to get these illegal and extremely dangerous Glock switches off our streets,” Ivey said in a statement after signing the bill into law.
These devices, which can be 3D printed or bought online for as little as $20, have become closely associated with Glock handguns, which are often cited as some of the easiest to modify.

Georgia-based Glock Inc. doesn’t manufacture, market or sell the devices, but the brand has become synonymous with them, fueled in part by frequent use of the term “Glock switch” in some genres of music and on social media platforms.
The growing use of these devices in crimes — including mass shootings — has prompted lawsuits from several cities and states accusing Glock of failing to prevent illegal modifications and contributing to public safety risks.
The company did not respond to Stateline’s multiple requests for comment.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed an auto sear ban into law in February as part of a broader public safety package. New Jersey could become the 27th state to enact a ban, after its General Assembly approved the measure in late March.
Other states — including Virginia and deeply conservative Mississippi — also have recently enacted bans. In GOP-led Tennessee, lawmakers are considering a similar measure, but the bill is still in committee and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns on April 25.
“It’s a big deal to talk about places like Alabama, Mississippi, Virginia, Indiana putting these laws on their books,” Monisha Henley, the senior vice president for governmental affairs at the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, told Stateline. “There is a general consensus that we don’t want a switch or device or auto sear to be able to attach to a firearm and turn into a weapon or war.”
Recovered at crime scenes
The bans on auto sears are a response to a sharp nationwide increase in the number of modified firearms being recovered at crime scenes.
In 2023, law enforcement agencies recovered 4,530 machine gun conversion devices, or auto sears, at crime scenes across the country, according to the latest annual data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as the ATF.


The number of these devices recovered and traced by the bureau, a process that involves tracking a firearm or device back to its first point of sale or distribution, rose from 658 in 2019 to 5,816 in 2023 — a 784% increase, according to a recent report. That total includes recoveries from all 50 states as well as U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
Between 2019 and 2023, conversion devices made up nearly 13% of all privately made firearms recovered by police and traced by the bureau — 11,088 out of 88,425 total.


Machine guns and conversion devices have been heavily restricted under federal law since 1934. While civilians can legally own machine guns made before 1986, those firearms must be registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. Newer machine guns and conversion devices are generally illegal.
There are exceptions for licensed dealers and manufacturers producing them for military or law enforcement use. Possession of an unregistered device carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a $250,000 fine.
The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, created by former President Joe Biden in 2023, quietly disappeared from the web on Jan. 21. Its website now returns a 404 error.
Just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a task force within the office delivered a list of strategies aimed at cracking down on machine gun conversion devices.
Trump, who campaigned on loosening gun regulations, signed an executive order in February directing the U.S. Department of Justice to review all federal rules and guidance for potential infringements on Second Amendment rights, including those issued by the shuttered Office of Gun Violence Prevention.

In early April, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced the creation of the Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force within the Justice Department. The announcement came soon after the rollback of the ATF’s “zero tolerance” policy, which previously required the agency to revoke the licenses of firearms dealers found to have willfully committed serious violations, such as selling guns without background checks or falsifying sales records.
Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department also established a separate task force, known as the ANTI-MCD Committee, to coordinate efforts and provide guidance on reducing the spread of machine gun conversion devices. Federal restrictions on machine guns and gun conversion devices remain in effect for now, but could change under the Trump administration.
Some gun rights groups argue state-level auto sear bans are unnecessary because the devices are already illegal under federal law.
“The overwhelming majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens and are not just going to illegally produce or purchase auto sears,” Chris Stone, the director of state affairs for Gun Owners of America, told Stateline. “When you make it doubly illegal, it’s not stopping any criminals who are purchasing auto sears on the black market.”
Alabama and New Mexico
Alabama’s ban on auto sears comes in the wake of a mass shooting in Birmingham last September in which the devices were used. The shooting left four people dead and 17 others injured.
The new law, which was sponsored in the Senate by Republican state Sen. Will Barfoot, makes it a felony to possess or sell any combination of parts intended to create an auto sear. Violators could face up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
“This wasn’t about infringing on people’s gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone,” Democratic state Rep. Phil Ensler, who collaborated with Barfoot on the bill, told Stateline. Ensler also pushed for an auto sear ban during the past two legislative sessions.
The legislation exempts law enforcement and individuals who register their firearms with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.










This wasn't about infringing on people's gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone.


– Alabama state Rep. Phil Ensler, D-Montgomery


According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 1,292 gun-related deaths in Alabama in 2023 — the latest year for which data is available. Alabama had the fourth-highest gun death rate in the nation at 25.3 deaths per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia, Mississippi and Louisiana had higher rates that year.
New Mexico saw 530 gun deaths in 2023, placing it just behind Alabama with the fifth-highest gun death rate at 25.1 deaths per 100,000 residents.
Las Cruces, New Mexico, Police Chief Jeremy Story has expressed strong support for the new auto sear ban, which makes possession of a conversion device punishable by up to three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Story also raised concern over the rise in juvenile crime, particularly the increasing use of gun conversion devices by teenagers.
Supporters in both Alabama and New Mexico argue that making possession of the devices a state offense allows local authorities to prosecute cases without relying on the limited resources of the federal court system.

“If this were not a state law … it’s completely unenforceable,” Ben Baker, the senior public safety adviser in the New Mexico governor’s office, told Stateline. “The federal government simply doesn’t have the resources, nor do they generally prosecute juvenile offenders,” said Baker, who has nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience.
Lawsuits against Glock
Several states and cities across the United States are taking legal and legislative action against Glock.
Lawsuits filed by Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and the cities of Baltimore and Chicago argue that Glock has long known about the widespread use of illegal auto sears but has failed to redesign its firearms to prevent these modifications.
In a court filing requesting the dismissal of Chicago’s lawsuit, Glock argued it should not be held responsible for illegal modifications made by third parties.
Beyond the courtroom, some states are weighing measures to prohibit the sale of firearms that can be easily modified with auto sears.
In California, such a bill has already passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. A similar bill in New York has stalled in a Senate committee since January. Both states’ legislatures remain in session until September and June, respectively, leaving time for the proposals to advance further.
Maryland lawmakers also considered a similar measure this year, but the bill failed to make it out of a House committee before the legislature adjourned in early April.
Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed a bill into law in early April that added “pistol converters,” or auto sears, to the state’s definition of rapid-fire modification devices. Possession of these devices already carried strict penalties.

The move was successful and delayed a vote on the bill. (Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Democrats were moments away from passing a cap on residential rent increases off the Washington state Senate floor Friday night. 
But a challenge from the Senate Republican leader, upheld by the lieutenant governor, is forcing a delay. 
The issue amounts more to a do-over than a derailment. Democrats are now poised to vote on House Bill 1217 on Sunday, the last scheduled day of the legislative session. 
The move from Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, late Friday came after about an hour of impassioned speeches about the help or damage that could result from the annual limit on rent increases, currently proposed to be 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower.
At issue is the bill’s title: “Improving housing stability for tenants subject to the residential landlord-tenant act and the manufactured/mobile home landlord-tenant act by limiting rent and fee increases, requiring notice of rent and fee increases, limiting fees and deposits, establishing a landlord resource center and associated services, authorizing tenant lease termination, creating parity between lease types, and providing for attorney general enforcement.”
This title is much longer than that of just about any other legislation this session in Olympia.
Braun argued it’s overly prescriptive, leaving little room for amendments, and no longer accurately described the proposal. He noted the bill didn’t have the original online “landlord resource center” the state Department of Commerce would have been required to create.
“If an aspect of the bill is removed yet still referenced in the title, it simply does not provide an accurate description for the public,” Braun said. “It’s like if we had a bill that talked about whales that were going to be in danger from outboard motors, and then we didn’t talk about whales, we talked about manatees.”
An amendment approved on the House floor six weeks ago, from Rep. Nicole Macri, a Seattle Democrat and one of the measure’s chief backers, took out the landlord resource center requirement. A month later, the Senate passed the bill without that requirement.
In response to Braun, Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, noted the legislation still had other resources for landlords.
Lt. Gov. Denny Heck, who serves as president of the Senate, took an extended break before delivering his ruling on the arguments. While noting drafters have “great latitude” to choose a bill title, the Democrat said this one breaks Senate rules.
“As this President and my predecessors have warned, while selecting such a title may tend to protect a bill by preventing certain unwarranted amendments to the bill, it is not without risk in the Senate, especially when changes are made to the bill,” said Heck. He concluded: “Senator Braun’s point is well taken and the measure is ineligible for final passage in its present form.”
Democratic staff and lawmakers responded with muttered expletives in the wings. 
The hullabaloo, which unfolded around 9 p.m. on Friday, came just a day after Democrats in the two chambers released a negotiated proposal meant to strike a compromise between the 7% limit on rent increases the House backed and the Senate-supported 10% plus inflation. 
To deal with Heck’s ruling, Democrats had to convene a second so-called conference committee to draft a revised proposal that adds back the resource center. They released the new version Saturday morning, about 12 hours after the previous bill collapsed.
“We know that our landlords are important, and I’m happy to see that in this final conference report that we have a landlord resource center so that they can get the resources that they need,” said Senate Housing Committee Chair Jessica Bateman, D-Olympia.
The chambers must now wait 24 hours before voting on it.
Despite the latest setback, Democrats emphasized this would just mean a delay, not the divisive legislation’s demise. 
“We’re going to pass rent stabilization this session,” House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said after a meeting with senators following Heck’s decision Friday night. 
But at the conference committee meeting Saturday morning, Rep. Sam Low, R-Lake Stevens, raised another issue: Can the new version of the bill include something not included in the iterations that passed the House and Senate?
Bateman pointed to the Legislature’s joint rule that appears to allow for such changes.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ferguson-inaugural-address-lawmakers-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-26 13:07:41.012206

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A property tax reform bill viewed as an alternative in case the primary measure fails passed the Senate unanimously Friday, putting pressure on a proposal supported by Gov. Kelly Armstrong to cross the finish line.
House Bill 1168 was amended to mirror many of the provisions in House Bill 1176, the bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, that Armstrong supports.
“It’s a very good bill and it’s there if (House Bill) 1176 fails,” said Sen. Mark Weber, R-Casselton. “Everything is ready to go here in (House Bill) 1168 and it contains significant relief along with our preferences from the Senate as to what needs to be included.”
North Dakota Senate advances property tax credit but plan differs from House

House Bill 1168 includes a primary residence credit of up to $1,650, an expansion of the homestead property tax credit, up to $600 for a renters rebate and an expansion of a disabled veterans property tax relief program.
The bill also includes a “skin-in-the-game” provision requiring primary residence owners to pay at least 25% of their property tax bill. Each primary residence would receive at least $500. Another provision urges lawmakers in the 2027 session to look at providing relief to other property types, such as commercial, centrally assessed, agricultural land and other residential property. 
In total, the bill is expected to provide more than $511 million in relief for the biennium, according to the most recent fiscal note provided by Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus.
The bill also includes similar 3% caps, which would limit local subdivision increases on property tax levies. Weber added, if the property valuation increases outpace the 3% cap, House Bill 1168 includes language to support school districts by making up the difference through the school funding formula to make their budgets whole.
Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, told lawmakers the large price tag for the bill is worrying especially at a time when the federal government is debating to reduce its cost share of Medicaid expansion payments to the states.
“If they change the federal match for Medicaid and Medicaid expansion, we are in big trouble,” Lee said. “It could be up to $330 million that the state will not get from the feds.”
North Dakota governor unveils bold property tax plan in first State of the State address

Sen. Brad Bekkendahl, R-Williston, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the Senate Appropriations Committee disagreed with Kroshus on the number of people that will use the new primary residence credit.
He said March 31 was the deadline to apply for the primary residence credit and about 143,000 North Dakota homeowners applied, which is less than 165,000 that were deemed eligible.
“We felt that the numbers in the fiscal note were inflated to a point where we actually took $70 million off on our calculation from these numbers … based on the number of homes we think will be actually paid the credit,” Bekkedahl said. 
House Bill 1168 will be returned to the House for its consideration of the Senate changes to the bill. If they do not agree with the changes, the bill differences will be resolved in a conference committee.
House Bill 1176, meanwhile, is in a conference committee, with the “skin in the game” provision a major point of contention between the House and Senate.

The truck was operated not by Hilcorp, the oil company, but by Brice Inc., a Native-owned construction firm that has worked with Hilcorp on its preparations for the summer drilling efforts in the remote Yukon Flats basin, north of Fairbanks.
Hilcorp is staging equipment for the drilling program at the Yukon River Camp, where the Dalton Highway, which connects urban Alaska to the North Slope oil fields, crosses the Yukon River. Once the ice on the river clears, the equipment will be barged up the Yukon toward drill sites.
 
Above the Yukon River, on Native land, Hilcorp is set to drill for oil this summer

	Thom Leonard, a spokesman for Brice’s parent company, Calista, said Brice’s truck was “between jobs” when the spill occurred earlier this month at a parking lot at the camp, which is run by a Fairbanks-based tourism business on federal land. 
The lot is typically used for “multi-day barging storage,” according to a post-spill report from Brice to regulators at the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, known as DEC.
There’s no indication that the fuel reached the Yukon itself, according to documents released by DEC. 
But critics of the drilling effort say the spill still serves as an example of the type of incidents that can happen during industrial operations like oil exploration.
The spill left some 600 gallons of pooled fuel in the parking lot that had to be vacuumed up by another truck. A video of the site obtained by Northern Journal showed workers walking through an ankle-deep pool that one of them described as diesel.
“We were told over and over again that we were overhyping the danger, we were alarmist, and that everything they were doing is perfectly safe,” Rhonda Pitka, the chief of the tribal government in the Yukon River village of Beaver, said in a phone interview. “It’s so disappointing.”

	Oil companies often hire contractors to perform specialized tasks, and Brice affiliates have worked for Hilcorp in the past.
Leonard, the spokesman for Brice’s parent company, would not say whether the truck had originally been in the area supporting Hilcorp, adding that “we don’t typically comment on clients we serve.” A Hilcorp spokesman also declined to comment. 
But an online update last month from Doyon Ltd., the regional Native corporation that owns land in the Yukon Flats where the oil drilling will take place, noted that a crew from Brice was doing debris clearing for Hilcorp’s exploration program.
A Doyon official said the company is aware of a situation that was reported to DEC but referred questions to Hilcorp as the “appropriate point of contact.”
Hilcorp’s search for oil in the Yukon Flats has support from Doyon and tribal leaders in Birch Creek, the Native village closest to where the summer drilling will take place. Other tribal leaders along the river and in Alaska’s Interior have harshly criticized the exploration campaign, saying that its potential risks are incompatible with the region’s salmon-dependent Native communities.

	While the spill took place April 6, according to documents released by DEC, drilling opponents only learned about it in recent days through word of mouth, according to Pitka. She described the incident as “exactly what we were afraid of.”
Opponents of the drilling program point to Hilcorp’s history in Alaska: The company, which traditionally has acquired and operated aging oil and gas infrastructure, has been fined for numerous incidents, and regulators have pointed to a “track record of regulatory noncompliance.”
A DEC official involved in the spill response, Terra Meares, described Brice as the “responsible party” for the spill and said that the purpose of the company’s equipment at the Yukon camp is beyond her agency’s jurisdiction. 
Decisions about potential penalties or enforcement actions, she added, would be made at higher levels of DEC. The director of the department’s spill prevention and response division was out of the office this week and unavailable for comment.
The truck was originally left at the parking lot April 4, “with no indication of leaks or issues,” according to Brice’s report to DEC. The spill was discovered early in the morning of April 6 by a camp resident who was watching the northern lights and saw or smelled fuel.
The truck’s tank holds 3,000 gallons, and the 600 gallons of “pooled fuel” were ultimately vacuumed up from snow- and ice-covered ground by another truck that was dispatched to the site, according to documents released by DEC. An excavator subsequently arrived at the site to remove thicker layers of contaminated ice, according to the documents.
Leonard, with Brice’s parent company, said the businesses “always strive to respect the environment.”
“We are Alaskans,” Leonard said in an email. “It pains us when incidents like this occur, although we are proud our team members took immediate action and followed all regulatory requirements.”

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)One of the toughest jobs in the South Dakota Legislature has to belong to Republican Party whips. Four legislators in each chamber are tasked with keeping their fellow GOP lawmakers in line. They’re supposed to ensure that the will of the majority leaders in both chambers is carried out by the party faithful. 
Whipping has to be a tough job in the Republican Party because there are so many members — 64 in the 70-member House and 32 in the 35-member Senate. It’s also a tough job because the Republican Party has been suffering from some growing pains, casting aside seasoned, traditional members in favor of a new breed with a different set of goals. 
There are plenty of new Republican faces in the Legislature and they bring with them a new set of issues. They’re keen on election integrity even though South Dakota elections are squeaky clean. They’re big on property rights, with many of the new batch winning primaries against incumbents who had the bad luck to vote for the Landowner Bill of Rights. They have a penchant for wanting to mix religious symbols with public education. Like traditional Republicans, they like to stretch the limits of the Second Amendment, this time going to the point where college students can be armed on campus and then don’t have to disarm themselves when they head to their favorite bar.

While criticizing absent Republicans, Democrats should look for their own candidates

Keeping a watchful eye on the work of legislators is Jim Eschenbaum, the new chairman of South Dakota’s Republican Party. A former Democrat, Eschenbaum earned his GOP bona fides by helping to recall the Landowner Bill of Rights and then defeating it at the ballot box. 
For those who pay attention to such things, the dust-ups between traditional Republicans and the new breed have been fun to watch. Eschenbaum seems intent on draining away that enjoyment. It looks like he wants what the Old Guard once had: everyone in the party voting in lockstep with leadership. 
If that’s the case, Eschenbaum had to be less than happy with a recent South Dakota Searchlight story that told how Republicans and Democrats worked together to soften a bill that, in its original form, would have caused librarians to be led away in handcuffs if a child was somehow allowed to check out obscene material. 
The path that House Bill 1239 took through the Legislature doesn’t reflect well on the Republican Party whips or party unity. The bill went through the House Education Committee on a 10-5 vote with four Republicans voting against the bill. In the full House, where a party-line vote would be 64-6, the bill passed 38-32 with 27 GOP members seeking its defeat. 
Over in the Senate, HB 1239 was endorsed 5-2 in the Senate Judiciary Committee with both no votes coming from Republicans. It was in the full Senate that the bill was amended to dispense with criminal penalties and instead require an appeals process for challenging materials in school and public libraries. That wasn’t easy-going, either, as the 18-16 vote included 16 votes to amend coming from Republicans. The amended bill sailed through the Senate 32-2. 
Back in the House, the amended bill was accepted, but not without a fight. The vote was 36-34 with 31 Republicans voting in favor of the amendment. That kind of split in the party will be grounds for a primary challenge if Eschenbaum has his way. 
In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, Eschenbaum said a Republican should be a constitutional conservative, voting to represent the South Dakota Constitution, the U.S. Constitution and the conservative values reflected in the party platform. 
To make sure lawmakers are toeing the party line, Eschenbaum has proposed a South Dakota GOP scorecard to keep track of how legislators vote. “I don’t know if the state central committee will decide to do it,” Eschenbaum said, “but it would be based on those three principles, the two constitutions and the party platform.”
Just as lawmakers who voted for the Landowner Bill of Rights were targeted in the last primary, it’s not hard to imagine Eschenbaum’s scorecard being used to drum up primary opponents for Republican lawmakers who insist on going their own way. “Just because you’re elected to office currently does not guarantee you’re going to get reelected to office again,” Eschenbaum said. “It just doesn’t.”
Some people may take heart when they see Republicans and Democrats working together in the Legislature so that librarians won’t be led away in chains. Others may think it’s refreshing when lawmakers have the courage to vote their conscience rather than toe the party line. It’s obvious that the new chairman of the Republican Party doesn’t see it that way.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Interior designers who work on large commercial construction projects may soon be required to get a state license if they want to work in Alaska.
On Wednesday, the Alaska Senate voted 18-2 to approve Senate Bill 54, which would create an interior design licensing process and modify the way the state regulates landscape architects.
If approved by the House and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, SB 54 would extend the term of the Board of Architects, Engineers, and Land Surveyors and it would require interior designers working on large, public-use projects to register with that board.
Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage, is the bill’s prime sponsor and said that the requirement is intended to improve the safety of commercial buildings.
“It’s part of our continuing work to make Alaska open and ready for business,” he said on the Senate floor.
In his sponsor statement, Claman said that the licensing would allow interior designers to submit stamped plans to permitting agencies for approval, potentially eliminating the need for a more expensive engineering review.
This is the third time that Claman has sponsored a bill requiring the registration of interior designers. Previous bills did not pass either the House or Senate, but this version is narrower than prior versions, said Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer. 
She opposed those prior versions but was willing to vote in favor of this one.
The “no” votes came from Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole, and Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla.
Speaking after the vote, Myers said he is concerned about the way the number of regulated professions is growing.
“I’m very skeptical of creating more occupational licenses, requiring people to register more,” he said.
“We’ve got so many problems in the private sector already; I really hesitate putting in any more barriers to employment, any more barriers to business.”
The bill has been scheduled for a hearing on Wednesday in the House Labor and Commerce Committee.

Henry McMaster called for a “nuclear power renaissance” in his recent State of the State address. Our governor urged lawmakers to support a revival of our state’s failed nuclear plant.
That’s a mistake given the inconvenient facts surrounding our state’s recent history with the V.C. Summer nuclear debacle.
I researched the future prospects for new nuclear power projects in the United States. While small modular reactors, or SMRs, have long-term potential for U.S. nuclear power, SMR’s are still on the drawing board.
There currently are no new nuclear plants under construction in the U.S.
The Deloitte Research Center for Energy & Industrials did an analysis as to whether new nuclear power plants could meet the projected need for future energy generation. The extensive analysis presumed robust deployment for the design, manufacture and projected costs of new nuclear power over the next decade. Even then, nuclear power could only meet 10% of the projected increase just for new data center demand by 2035.
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association has projected that data center growth coupled with transportation electrification will drive a 50% increase in U.S. electricity demand through 2050.
The industry points to the reliability of nuclear power along with its lower emissions. But what about the construction delays and the resulting cost overruns? And what about the creation of more radioactive waste? High-level radioactive waste is currently being stored on site, but that waste will remain radioactive for thousands of years.
The U.S. doesn’t have a long-term repository for high-level radioactive waste.
Let’s look at Georgia’s recent experience with their Vogtle nuclear power plant. Vogtle was approved in 2009. Yet the project wasn’t completed until 2024, seven years behind schedule. To make matters worse, Vogtle’s projected costs ballooned from its initial estimate of $14 billion to roughly $35 billion.
As a result, Georgia’s ratepayers have seen six rate increases since 2023. Do we want rapid increases in our electric bills in South Carolina?
When it comes to building new nuclear power plants, the real problem comes down to excessive costs. Nuclear construction costs range from $6,417 per kilowatt to $12,681 per kW. Compare that to $1,290 per kW for new gas-fired plants. This vast difference in construction costs will result in much higher electric bills.
S.C. ratepayers would be on the hook for all nuclear construction costs. But it doesn’t end there. Add the costs of nuclear fuel, ongoing maintenance, and the storage of the nuclear waste, and the costs are astronomical.
S.C. ratepayers are already paying for the failed V.C. Summer nuclear plant after it was abandoned in 2017. That failed nuclear project ultimately bankrupted SCE&G and Westinghouse. Several utility executives were convicted and served prison or home detention sentences for their role in covering up those cost overruns.
Remember too that those same utility executives hid the independent Bechtel report from the Public Service Commission and the public. Why? So they could continue to get their millions in cash bonuses by covering up their crimes. If not for a mid-level whistleblower, this cover up would have cost our residents, small businesses and large industries even more damage.
Santee Cooper, our state-owned utility, is soliciting proposals to see if others might be interested in buying the partially built nuclear reactors. It seems inconceivable that any entity would want to invest in that failed project, though many companies have shown initial interest. Formal proposals are due May 5.
The experts interviewed by Utility Dive wouldn’t hazard a guess about how much it would cost to complete V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3.
Santee Cooper and Dominion Energy have already made it clear that they have no interest in trying to revive V.C. Summer, even though they still own the site.
When all is said and done, neither should South Carolina. We would be foolish to risk repeating those same mistakes again. The bottom line: New nuclear power plants are not a viable option. There’s too much risk.
Our state’s future power generation needs are best met with a mix of existing nuclear plants, existing gas plants, new solar coupled with battery storage, hydro dams and pump storage. Currently, solar panels with storage are the lowest cost option for our state’s electricity generation.
During an earnings call Wednesday, NextEra Energy CEO John Ketchum said the U.S. must remain realistic and pragmatic about its energy policies.
“We need to be practical about when technologies will be available at scale and how much they’ll cost when they show up — all of which factors into how much Americans pay on their electric bill each month,” he said.
Low-cost renewables and battery storage should be used as a “critical bridge,” he said. “We cannot isolate ourselves to just a couple of technologies, like gas and nuclear, which are much more expensive than they’ve ever been and take far longer to build.”
Small modular nuclear reactors are “still 10 years away at scale in the best of scenarios,” he added.
South Carolina should think twice about building more nuclear power plants.
Nuclear power plants are just too expensive to build. And the small modular nuclear reactors are a decade away from being a viable alternative.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2264-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-04-26 09:12:14.138527

Aaron Henry testifies before the Credentials Committee at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Credit: Wikipedia
Civil rights activists started the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to challenge the state’s all-white regular delegation to the Democratic National Convention. 
The regulars had already adopted this resolution: “We oppose, condemn and deplore the Civil Rights Act of 1964 … We believe in separation of the races in all phases of our society. It is our belief that the separation of the races is necessary for the peace and tranquility of all the people of Mississippi, and the continuing good relationship which has existed over the years.” 
In reality, Black Mississippians had been victims of intimidation, harassment and violence for daring to try and vote as well as laws passed to disenfranchise them. As a result, by 1964, only 6% of Black Mississippians were permitted to vote. A year earlier, activists had run a mock election in which thousands of Black Mississippians showed they would vote if given an opportunity. 
In August 1964, the Freedom Party decided to challenge the all-white delegation, saying they had been illegally elected in a segregated process and had no intention of supporting President Lyndon B. Johnson in the November election.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Early in this year’s legislative session, state officials looking to close a $3 billion budget gap targeted the “unsustainable growth” in developmental disabilities services as one of the main drivers of the deficit and set out to cut $457 million from the program.
What followed was 90 days of emotion, rallies, negotiating and arguing that ended with both sides getting to a place they could live with: Advocates were able to claw back close to $300 million in cuts and got program reductions to a level they said was regrettable but survivable, at least.
But after all that, both sides now wonder if they fixed the problem they set out to solve, of unsustainable growth in the self-directed care portion of the Developmental Disabilities Administration. One lawmaker said all of this year’s wrangling may amount to a Band-Aid on a problem they could be visiting again next year.
“I’m not sure that the legislature was able to address some of the underlying concerns with needs of the community being balanced against spending that seems to continue to increase,” said Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard) who serves on the Senate Finance Committee.
“I think there are still fundamental issues that are outstanding that probably need a deeper review, and agreement upon on what approach to take to bring spending on DDA services to a level that the state can sustain,” he said.
A spokesperson with the Department of Health said in a written statement Wednesday that the agency “expects to continue discussions on DDA program sustainability.”
“The Maryland Department of Health is deeply committed to providing high-quality services that support Marylanders with disabilities,” the statement said. “To drive that effort forward, the department will work in partnership with the Maryland General Assembly and key stakeholders.”

In early discussions on the fiscal 2026 budget, former Health Secretary Laura Herrera Scott pointed to an increase in enrollment for the “self-directed service” model of care as a contributing factor for the agency’s budget woes.
Enrollment for self-directed services grew more thatn 30% in both 2023 and 2024, particularly among young people moving from school into the Medicaid waiver program, according to the health department. Budget analysts have suggested that self-directed services tend to cost the state more than community-based services.
The DDA administers Medicaid waivers that allow Marylanders with developmental disabilities to receive a wide variety of services, from live-in caregiver supports to transportation, respite care, employment services and more.
At the end of 2024, there were about 16,800 Marylanders who selected a community model Medicaid waiver, where people join an established organization for disability care. Another 3,600 waiver recipients elected the self-directed model, where the waiver recipient or their family hires individual employees for services.
“It is true that people are choosing self-direction,” said Alicia Wopat, president of the Self-Directed Advocacy Network of Maryland. “I think COVID-19 gave people a glimpse into what self-direction is like, because providers sadly couldn’t provide during that period of time … I don’t think the growth is unexpected.”
Wopat hopes that the increased interest will mean that self-directed services can be protected in future budget discussions, not slashed with budget cuts.
“It’s important for all of us to have choices in how we run our lives, and it should be no different for people with a disability,” Wopat said.
The General Assembly ultimately cut some $164 million from the DDA in fiscal 2026, as part of the larger budget wrangling this year. For self-directed services, that means cuts to a program that helps families afford one-time expenses to support their family member with developmental disabilities, as well as caps on wage bonuses for some of the self-directed service care providers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But despite those cuts, Lam said that there are still some details that need to be understood regarding the DDA budget. The “restored” funding this year serves as a “Band-Aid” on the issue, while lawmakers and community leaders figure out how to fund the developmental disabilities programs sustainably, he said.
“There are still questions on why the cost of these services continue to rise so significantly, why self-directed care seems to be rising significantly,” Lam said.
“That discussion is hard to have during the throes of session, and so what took place this session was a Band-Aid to hold the community over,” Lam said, “but it doesn’t address the underlying issues there that have been festering for a while.”
Temporary factors
There were other factors that led to the financial woes at the DDA, some of which were temporary and should not play as much of a role in future budget discussions as they did this year, said Laura Howell, CEO of the Maryland Association of Community Services.
Howell noted service providers have now all transitioned from the old payment model to a fee-for-service payment model, that should allow for better spending forecasts for the agency.
The previous model paid providers up-front and expenses would be reconciled at a later date. The department periodically needed to account for unexpected costs, as the older system did not accurately project spending needs to deliver services. The new model, which was being phased in over the past few years, providers are reimbursed for services delivered.
The health department agrees that the new payment system will help the state officials better understand the DDA’s spending.
How did we get here?: Analysts, officials unsure how disability agency overspent

Meanwhile, lawmakers have boosted reporting requirements from the health department so they can also keep tabs on spending at the DDA.
Other factors that contributed to some of budget deficit at the DDA were a result of higher pay increases for staff from an increase in the state’s minimum wage, and the expiration of COVID-era relief dollars that had been supporting the agency.
“So all of those things led to the [spending] issues that we saw this year. We shouldn’t be seeing those things moving forward, nothing should be a surprise,” Howell said.
Howell agrees that the “unanswered question” in future DDA budget talks is whether the state is able to support funding for self-directed services.
“It’s hard to imagine that we could possibly be anywhere close to the same situation where were with this year,” she said. “I can’t see any reason why the DDA shouldn’t be able to adequately and accurately project the cost moving forward, because all the data should be there. The only question is what happens with self-direction budgets.”
As for Wopat, she hopes that the state includes more voices from the self-directed services community so that the model can be protected for those who rely on care that is more individualized.
“I hope everyone is included in those conversations as to how to best manage what’s happened with the state’s finances,” Wopat said. “That stakeholders of all kinds have opportunities to collaborate and come up with solutions that are best for people.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_nov19_selfdirected_disabilityrally_edit-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-26 08:01:21.620710

Admission to Africana studies, Asian studies, data analytics, disability studies, Middle East studies, philosophy, religious studies, Spanish and women’s and gender studies programs has been suspended starting with the 2025-26 school year “in compliance with SB1”, according to a Monday news release from the university.
Students currently enrolled in one of the programs can still complete their degree and all nine of these programs will remain available as minors.
“I also want to be clear that these disciplines remain an important part of UToledo,” Dr. Scott Molitor, Toledo’s interim provost and executive vice president of academic affairs, said in a written statement. “Faculty will continue to teach courses that are part of minors, certificates or concentrations, as well as significant components of our core curriculum.”
Senate Bill 1 bans diversity efforts, regulates classroom discussion, prohibits faculty strikes, creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, and eliminates undergraduate degree programs that produce on average less than five degrees annually over a three-year period, among other things.
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced the bill at the end of January, it quickly passed both chambers and Gov. Mike DeWine signed it into law March 28. It affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges, and is set to take effect at the end of June. Youngstown State University faculty are trying to get a referendum on the November ballot to block S.B. 1.
UT was already undergoing an annual review of low-enrolled academic programs when DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law, according to the university.
“At the same time UToledo was undergoing its program review process, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law Senate Bill 1, which includes language that requires universities to eliminate undergraduate programs that have conferred fewer than five degrees annually over any three-year period,” according to the university.
Those nine programs had 57 students majoring in them during the spring semester and 15 students graduated from those programs during the 2023-24 school year, according to the university.
Toledo is suspending 12 additional degree programs unrelated to S.B. 1. They are:

Bachelor of Business Administration in Organizational Leadership and Management
Bachelor of Science in Health Information Administration
Master of Arts in Philosophy
Master of Arts in Sociology
Master of Education in Educational Research and Measurement
Master of Education in Educational Technology
Master of Education in Educational Psychology
Master of Music in Music Performance
Master of Science in Geology
Ph.D. in Curriculum & Instruction: Early Childhood
Ph.D. in Curriculum & Instruction: Educational Technology
Ph.D. in Foundations of Education: Research and Measurement

“It is important to keep our academic portfolio current with the degree programs our students want and that industry needs from their higher education partner,” Molitor said. “This is now our third year of an annual process to evaluate our programs and make sure we are allocating resources to areas in high demand, which requires us to both look for new programs we should start offering and existing programs that we should stop offering.”

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — Following recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia, and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters — massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents, and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris, and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities, and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

If this bill becomes law, the state will prevent municipalities in Missouri from enacting source of income discrimination bans, and will void bans already in place in St. Louis, Webster Groves, Columbia and Clayton, along with a portion of Kansas City.
Source of income discrimination bans are designed to prevent landlords from refusing to rent to potential tenants based solely on the kind of income that they have available to them. Many landlords will only consider W-2 wages when evaluating potential tenants, but this helps to prevent many of the poorest among us from being able to access safe, stable housing.
A single mother may have child support payments as her primary source of income, but a landlord isn’t bound to consider that when she applies for tenancy. A bus driver who has suffered repetitive stress injuries and now receives Social Security Disability Insurance may also struggle to find a landlord who is willing to rent to them.
However, the most common form of source of income discrimination is a refusal to accept Housing Choice Vouchers, also known as Section 8, a federal housing program that has been addressing homelessness in the U.S. since 1974.
Despite being chronically underfunded by the federal government, these vouchers have been proven to lift people out of poverty, improve mental and physical health outcomes, and decrease homelessness. Seventy-five percent of HCV holders have extremely low incomes, defined as less than 30% of the federal poverty line (currently $32,150 for a family of four) or less than 30% of the local area median income.
These folks do not earn enough money to qualify for tenancy on their own; the section 8 program allows these families to pay 30% of their income in rent while the government pays the balance.
The legislation, which has cleared the House and Senate in differing forms, would make it extremely difficult for these low-income renters, the majority of whom have already experienced chronic homelessness, to find housing. It’s like finally finding a golden ticket after years of searching and then having it snatched away.
A 2018 study showed that over 67% of landlords refused to rent to voucher-holders in cities without source of income anti-discrimination laws. In comparison, less than 31% of landlords refused to rent to voucher holders in cities with source of income discrimination bans in place. This demonstrates that source of income discrimination bans are effective local public policy and should not be preempted by our state government.
This legislation is being framed as a protection for landlords, seeking to prevent them from being “forced” to participate in a federal program. They say that this is government infringement on the property rights of landlords. They say that it’s too hard to comply with government regulations for landlords who participate in the section 8 program.
This is utter and complete nonsense.
To participate as a landlord, property owners simply have to submit to an annual inspection and ensure that their rental rates are in compliance with federal Fair Market Rent standards, which are typically very generous. Inspection protocols have recently been revised to only consider key health and safety factors rather than cosmetic issues.
And, quite frankly, in listening to legislative committee discussion on this issue over the last two years, it seems like the concerns of landlords are actually centered on a prejudiced belief that poor renters are bad tenants.
Federal data shows that renters using housing vouchers are actually excellent tenants who stay in a unit for an average of 7 to 8 years, despite the fact that landlords are free to evict them for breaking the terms of their rental agreement. This is because of the program’s smooth transitions in employment status of renters, adjusting the amount paid by the government based on fluctuations in the income of the renter.
Voucher holders are also typically assigned a case manager that helps renters to understand the terms of their lease and comply with landlord regulations.
Over 86% of rental units in the country are owned by for-profit entities.
If we allow these landlords to opt-out of renting to single parents living on child support, individuals with disabilities that prevent them from working full-time, and seniors and other low-income families utilizing these federal vouchers, where do we envision they will go?
We are a nation that abhors the homeless, but we continue to pass policies that exacerbate homelessness.
Time and time again, Missouri legislators prioritize the perceived “rights” of business owners over ensuring the basic needs of Missourians.
Our state motto, “salus populi suprema lex esto,” translates to “the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law.”  Our legislators continue to defy this principle in favor of making it easier for business owners to make money.
The highest profile example of this behavior this session is the legislature pushing to overturn the new requirement for business owners to provide paid sick leave to employees that was just approved by voters in November. If you can’t afford to pay sick leave to your employees, you shouldn’t be in business.
And you shouldn’t leave families living on the streets because you are unwilling to take part in a fifty-year-old safety net program designed to keep them safely housed.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_4515-scaled-e1725567309853-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-04-26 07:00:15.662676

(Screenshot of Nebraska Public Media livestream)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s projected budget deficit for the next two years has grown by $190 million after the state’s economic forecasting board fixed its previous estimates to be more on target.
State lawmakers have less than a month to fill the gap.
The Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board on Friday afternoon revised its earlier projections for the final two months of this fiscal year as well as the next two fiscal years that lawmakers are considering in the annual budget-writing process. The budget advanced from the Appropriations Committee on Thursday, without revised projections, at the time with $124 million left to find.

Two measures advanced Thursday to the final stage of lawmaking, related to school retirement and repealing recently passed business incentives, filling that most recent budget hole with $7 million to spare.
That means the $190 million added to the next two fiscal years will nearly all need to be found in spending cuts or new revenue.
Lawmakers will begin debating the Appropriations Committee’s advanced budget bills May 6 and must send them to Gov. Jim Pillen by the end of the 80th legislative day: May 15.
The Friday revised projections also increased the budget hole for the current fiscal year by a separate $190 million amount. It will be absorbed through state reserves.
Disappointing but not unexpected
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Appropriations Committee chair, attended the forecast and said future details will be day by day. Some cash reserves might be used.
Clements said he doesn’t like to be in a negative position but that Nebraska has good cash reserves. He’s hopeful the economy will be better than projected but senators “have to deal with the forecast that we have.”
  State Sen. Brad von Gillern of Elkhorn. Aug. 8, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the companion Revenue Committee, said he was disappointed in the forecast but that it’s reflective of global uncertainty, which leads to negativity in projections.
He said he doesn’t dispute the board’s numbers but was unhappy that internal projections between the Legislative Fiscal Office and Nebraska Department of Revenue weren’t more in sync. The average legislative estimates anticipated $300 million less revenue than the average department projections for the next biennium.
‘Chaos is the word of the day’
Former State Sen. John Kuehn of Heartwell, a member of the forecast board, was among the nine forecasters who said federal uncertainty is impacting their local communities.
“Chaos is the word of the day,” Kuehn said.
He said investments are unpredictable and that it is difficult for consumers or businesses to make firm long-term plans.
“Just keep your head on a swivel and see what the day’s news cycle is going to bring, and don’t open your accounts,” Kuehn said. “And if you do, be sitting down.”
  State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth. Aug. 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Other forecasters noted the up-and-down nature of tariffs from President Donald Trump. Clements said it could take a little while to settle down from that feeling of “chaos.”
“It’s unfortunate that we had to do this so quickly after these tariffs, before they were negotiated and resolved,” Clements said.
‘Catch its breath’
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, upon learning of the amended economic forecast figures, gave a reaction some Nebraskans might share: “Holy s—.”
He said his immediate thought was that if senators want to consider a pause in the multi-year lowering of the income tax rate for the highest earners and corporations, “it is there, ready to go.”
Pausing those rates at 4.99%, rather than going down to 3.99% by the start of 2027, could save nearly $500 million over the next biennium, according to a fiscal estimate for Brandt’s Legislative Bill 171.
“We could just stop it for a year or two to allow the state to catch its breath, and we can do that without increasing any taxes, no new taxes,” Brandt told the Nebraska Examiner.
Clements and von Gillern said they have no appetite for “pausing” income tax rates, which von Gillern said could lead to more harm. Opponents have said applicable Nebraskans are now expecting the 2023-enacted tax cuts and a change would equate to a tax increase for those folks.
“We know that the one thing we can do to improve our bottom line is to keep people here,” von Gillern said. “If we raise the income tax or pause the income tax cut, we’re going to continue to drive people off like we did for decades.”
LB 171 has not advanced from the Revenue Committee.

Sales taxes
Brandt also has LB 169 and LB 170, which would add a statewide sales tax to pop, candy and about 18 other goods or services, such as swimming pool cleaning and maintenance, dating services, chartered flights, lobbying and pet grooming. Taxes on cigarettes would also increase. 
Both bills have advanced from the Revenue Committee, as has LB 712 from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward to increase taxes on vapes up to 40% wholesale.
Earlier on Friday lawmakers, in a 34-10 vote, lawmakers approved LB 9 from Hughes to increase taxes on alternative nicotine products, designed to automatically capture emerging tobacco products. A fiscal note estimates about $3 million for the next biennium.
Brandt called it a “test” as the body considers the broader sales tax and sin tax bills. He and von Gillern said the forecast could change the calculus.
“I think the body’s going to have to take those a little more seriously than they thought they were going to,” von Gillern said.
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, a freshman member of the Appropriations Committee, did not vote to advance the mainline budget Thursday. She declined to vote “yes” or “no,” and it advanced 7-1 over the opposition of State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha.
Spivey said she is not a fan of the Brandt sales tax bills, which she said could disproportionately impact people from marginalized communities. She said the deficit and tax burden can’t continue to be put “on people that are struggling to make ends meet that we really need to address some of the larger ticket items that we know are actually causing the deficit.”
Other big-ticket items
Spivey said the forecast was not the news she and others were hoping for, but it was expected. She said difficult decisions are ahead and that senators need to take a different approach, such as revisiting expenditures for the new state prison, Perkins County Canal and income or property tax relief programs.

Cavanaugh and Spivey, among others, have said the deficit is self-inflicted and that future budget years look even worse. Spivey said senators must prioritize investments to grow the economy and provide a return on investment. That includes smart justice reform, she said.
“I think there needs to be some serious and deliberate conversations that we have to sit in and we cannot keep avoiding,” Spivey said.
Brandt, chair of the Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee, said cuts to the Perkins County Canal “ain’t going to happen.” 
“If we do that, it’s going to get ugly,” he said. “I’m not willing to do that.”
On Tuesday, while on a different Brandt bill to merge two state agencies and prioritize water resources, State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha sought to shrink the canal size, saving $61 million to $150 million. The $61 million effort failed 12-29. The $150 million effort failed 13-33.
Other reactions
Pillen, reflecting in a statement on the forecast, did not address a root cause of the revised forecast: volatility of $100 million less in individual income tax each of the next two years. Instead, he said the state had “a great opportunity to be strong fiscal conservatives.”
“I am looking forward to working with the Legislature to close the budget gap while delivering the property tax relief that Nebraskans expect and deserve,” Pillen said Friday.

Pillen’s original budget recommendations left $62.4 million in wiggle room for lawmakers, if all of his ideas and those from senators were adopted. That included investments in property tax relief being led by Hughes, which, for now, remain in the Education Committee.
One major item different from the Appropriations Committee budget and Pillen’s is increasing rather than cutting state funds to the University of Nebraska, a difference of about $46 million.
Rebecca Firestone, executive director of the OpenSky Policy Institute think tank, said it’s clear that the state will face “significant headwinds” for the budget but that lawmakers have options to ensure access to “critical state services.”
“Now is the time to consider making thoughtful choices about raising revenue in a fair and sustainable manner,” Firestone said in a statement. “We urge the Legislature to resist the temptation to balance the budget by making deep cuts to critical services like health care and education.”



How the forecasting board works
The Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board consists of nine members, five appointed by the Legislature’s Executive Board and four appointed by the governor. Members meet every February and October as well as each April in odd-numbered years. Additional meetings can be called by the board chair.
The Nebraska Department of Revenue and the Legislative Fiscal Office each give revenue estimates that help inform the board’s decision in crafting forecasts, including tax receipts. Economic tools are also used.
For each fiscal year, board members anonymously write projections for sales taxes, individual income taxes, corporate income taxes and miscellaneous taxes, informed by the estimates.
The values are collected and a range is created, as well as an average. A motion can be made for any final projection, which must receive five votes. The final projection must be approved, too.
The next forecasting board meeting is set for Oct. 31.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NEFAB-042525-meeting-1024x576.png,,,2025-04-26 07:00:15.662676

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A district judge in Utah issued a marvelous decision on April 18, finding Utah’s school voucher law to be unconstitutional. The 60-page decision was based on a variety of constitutional flaws that the Utah law shares with Idaho’s recently-enacted education tax credit law. The Utah law was enacted in 2023 with $42.5 million in state funds. State funding increased by $40 million in each of the next two years.  
The Utah judge said the Utah Constitution gives “a direct command to the legislature to perform a single duty: establish and maintain the state’s education systems.’” The judge continued, “This clear expression of one duty — coupled with the absence of any general duty to provide for the education or intellectual improvement of Utahns — impliedly restricts the legislature from creating a publicly funded school or education program outside of the public school system.” In other words, Utah’s Legislature is restricted from using public funds to support any form of private education.
Of interest is the fact that every member of the Idaho Legislature was sent a “Legislative Alert” on the first day of the 2025 legislative session, warning that any scheme to use taxpayer money for private education would be violative of the Idaho Constitution in a number of respects. The alert was provided by The Committee to Protect and Preserve the Idaho Constitution, a group that participated in the successful lawsuit to overturn the restrictive initiative law enacted in 2021. 
The alert identified the same constitutional flaw focused upon by the Utah judge — that Idaho’s Constitution prohibits the funding of private and parochial education. That has been the law of Idaho ever since statehood in 1890.
The alert spelled out several other constitutional infirmities that any voucher scheme would entail, including a deliberate transgression of Idaho’s strong prohibition against state support for religious education, discrimination against rural kids and Idaho religions that don’t operate parochial schools, lack of accountability for taxpayer money expended on private schooling, and diminution of state money necessary to support Idaho’s public school system, which has been chronically underfunded for decades.
The Utah judge’s decision mentioned a number of other infirmities in the Utah law — private schools often exclude students with special needs, or condition admission upon adherence to certain religious beliefs, or fail to provide “free” schooling as constitutionally required for taxpayer-supported education. These flaws are also inherent in House Bill 93, the subsidy bill approved by the Legislature this year.
The Idaho Legislature was clearly warned of the serious constitutional problems with House Bill 93, which will subsidize private and parochial education to the tune of $50 million in just the first year. Yet, because of massive funding from out-of-state groups that are seeking to weaken public schools across the nation, a majority of our legislators cast aside the Constitution and passed the subsidy bill. The governor lacked the courage to veto the legislation, despite overwhelming public outcry against it. 
Now, as with the similar travesty in Utah, concerned Idahoans will have to resort to the courts in order to protect the wishes of Idaho’s constitutional drafters. Please stay tuned.

Now, it needs to take the next step and boost its proxy voting rules so its voice is heard by corporate  boards.","The Maryland State Pension and Retirement System has a Climate Advisory Panel to advise on its investments, but it needs to add climate-aware proxy voting standards on its corporate shares as well, writes Shruti Bhatnagar. (Photo by Skórzewiak/stock.adobe.com)Maryland’s public pension, the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System (SRPS), is making strides to address the climate crisis, but it has more work to do.
The SRPS stewards the retirement savings of public sector workers in Maryland, and key to its role in providing a reliable retirement benefit is the system’s ability to anticipate and manage climate change’s sweeping economic impacts. In late 2024, the SRPS created a Climate Advisory Panel to bring in climate experts, which shows great promise for a comprehensive climate strategy.
But SRPS must not wait to adopt well-established practices. In particular, SRPS’s proxy voting guidelines, the policy that establishes how it will vote on key issues at shareholder meetings, need to align with the urgency of the climate crisis and the financial risks of climate change.
Proxy voting guidelines allow pensions like SRPS to leverage its influence as investors by voting at the annual meetings of major corporations on key issues like climate disclosures, biodiversity protections and Indigenous rights. Right now, SRPS’s guidelines are missing language on climate risk, and the pension system is failing to support critical climate votes.

Strong proxy guidelines are a powerful tool to protect retirement savings while advocating for responsible corporate behavior. Maryland’s economy — and the retirement security of its thousands of public sector workers — depends on a stable climate, and SRPS has a responsibility to fully employ the tools at its disposal to address climate change.
SRPS Earned a “D” for Proxy Voting Performance
Despite its growing awareness of climate risk, Maryland’s pension system still lags in holding corporations accountable.
In a recent evaluation by the Sierra Club, Maryland earned a “D” for its proxy voting guidelines and 2024 voting record. The evaluation highlighted SRPS’s failure to support key shareholder resolutions on biodiversity and climate accountability. Additionally, SRPS missed critical opportunities to hold corporate directors responsible for misaligned business practices that exacerbate the climate crisis.
Proxy voting guidelines serve as a blueprint for defining responsible corporate behavior. Strengthening these policies would allow SRPS to better align its investments with Maryland’s climate goals and safeguard the retirement savings of public employees. As some of the largest shareholders in the country, public pensions like SRPS have the power — and the obligation — to push corporations to adopt sustainable business practices.
The Stakes for Maryland’s Economy and Workers
The financial risks of climate change are no longer theoretical. Extreme weather events, supply chain disruptions, and shifting energy markets create instability that threatens corporate profits and investors. When pensions ignore these investment risks, it jeopardizes the long-term returns that retirees depend on.
SRPS has already acknowledged these dangers and taken initial steps to assess climate-related financial risks. However, its weak proxy voting guidelines remain a critical gap in its overall strategy. Stronger guidelines would ensure that SRPS doesn’t just acknowledge climate risk — it is actively working to mitigate it.
As the impacts of climate change accelerate, SRPS must take a leadership role in pushing for meaningful change. Maryland’s climate goals are ambitious, but those efforts are undermined if our public pension fails to align its investment policies with our state climate targets.
Strengthening its proxy voting guidelines would allow SRPS to hold corporations accountable for their climate-wrecking behavior and incentivize a shift toward sustainable business practices. These actions would not only align our public pension’s investments with our state’s climate goals — it would also protect the financial future of our public sector workers and retirees.
A Call for Stronger Action
Maryland has an opportunity to lead by example. Strengthening SRPS’s proxy voting guidelines is a necessary and practical step toward protecting the retirement savings of thousands of public sector workers and fostering a thriving economy. By demanding that corporations act responsibly, Maryland can reduce climate risk, protect our public pension, and secure a sustainable future for all.
As the 2025 shareholder season approaches, all eyes are on SRPS. Public sector workers, environmental advocates, and communities will be watching to see whether the pension will rise to the challenge, or continue to lag behind.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AdobeStock_452740190-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-04-26 07:00:15.662676

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.












They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency




Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Matthew Perschall / Louisiana Illuminator)Amid discussions of splitting LSU’s top leadership role into two positions, System President William Tate is moving his office to the same campus building that once held the school chancellor’s office. 
LSU Board of Supervisors members Collis Temple Jr. and Rémy Starns confirmed to the Illuminator there have been discussions about splitting the two jobs, though board action has not been scheduled. 
When asked about the proposal after the supervisors’ meeting Friday, Chairman Scott Ballard said the proposal was “not on my agenda.” 

“I don’t think we’ll ever do that,” Ballard said. 
The system president and chancellor roles were merged into one post in 2012, after which the joint office-holder began working out of the University Administration Building on West Lakeshore Drive. Tate will move into offices at David Boyd Hall, a building near Memorial Tower on campus that housed the chancellor’s office before the positions were merged. Tate’s staff and some other workers currently based at the University Administration Building, including employees in the general counsel’s office, will also make the move. 
“We’re going to go back to that tradition,” said LSU chief of staff Ashley Arceneaux, Tate’s top aide. 
Arceneaux said the move does not indicate splitting the roles is imminent and Tate will still maintain an office in the University Administration Building. 
“That’s always been a conversation,” Arceneaux said of splitting the roles. “A change like that would be a long-term change, and so I think there would have to be a lot of discussion.”

“Defendants’ actions are unlawful,” Harvard’s lawsuit states. “The First Amendment does not permit the Government to ‘interfere with private actors’ speech to advance its own vision of ideological balance.’”
Yet in his first term, President Donald J. Trump declared that free speech mattered.
Trump issued the “Executive Order Restoring Free Speech and Ending Federal Censorship” on March 21, 2019. In it, he expressed the importance of free inquiry and open debate to education and directed federal officials to use the federal government’s funding of higher education to ensure that universities promote free inquiry.
Channeling free-speech champions Benjamin Franklin and James Madison, Trump wrote that “free inquiry is an essential feature of our Nation’s democracy.”
As a professor of constitutional, criminal and comparative law, and as a citizen who enjoys his liberty, I agree.
Free speech is fundamental to human progress. Scientific, medical, technological and social advancements all rely on the free flow of information. Robust discussion and disagreement are equally important to maintaining a healthy constitutional republic.
In the words of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”
The First Amendment’s free speech and press clauses protect all forms of expression – oral, print, digital and artistic – from governmental interference or punishment.
Of the many types of speech, political speech is the most protected.
On the first day of his second term in office, Trump issued another free speech executive order. It affirms the administration’s commitment to free speech, directs that tax money is not used to abridge free speech and instructs federal employees to “identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech.”
In a vacuum, Trump’s orders appear to bode well for free speech.
But what is important is free speech reality, not rhetoric. Three months into his second term, where does Trump stand?
The many interconnected orders, letters, statements and actions of Trump’s White House make an assessment of any positive effects difficult. On the other hand, the Trump administration has clearly violated and chilled free speech on many occasions.
 
Repression and retaliation
Attempts to silence the president’s adversaries are developing as a pattern.
Law firms and attorneys who have sued or prosecuted Trump, or represented his adversaries, have been targeted for retribution and concessions. It began with an executive order on March 6, 2025, directed at the U.S.-based global law firm Perkins Coie, which had once represented Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton. A second order was issued on March 14, 2025, against Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison because it once employed an attorney who investigated Trump. Subsequently, at least six other prominent law firms were also targeted.
Several law firms acceded to the president’s demands, agreeing to accept clients without regard to political beliefs, to eliminate DEI practices, and to perform pro bono work valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars for causes Trump supports.
The firms that didn’t accede to the president’s demands had their security clearances removed, access to federal buildings restricted, and were banned from working for federal agencies. A few of the firms that didn’t relent have won temporary injunctions barring the administration’s actions against them.
The nonpartisan free speech advocacy organization Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression decried the orders as threatening the foundations of justice and free speech. In one of several challenges to these orders, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote on March 12, 2025, that Trump’s order appeared motivated by “retaliatory animus” and concluded that it “runs head on into the wall of First Amendment protections.” Two other federal courts reached similar conclusions.
In the first three months of his second term, Trump withdrew Secret Service protection of several prominent critics who are former federal government officials, including John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, his top aide, Brian Hook, and former high-level health official Anthony Fauci also lost their security protection.
It is hard to imagine that these decisions won’t have a profoundly chilling effect on potential critics of the president, especially since the revocations were publicly announced and each individual has been the subject of credible threats resulting from their governmental service.
 
Targeting the press
A similar pattern exists for journalists, where Trump is using his power to punish organizations whose reporting he doesn’t like.
AP journalists were banned from the White House and Air Force One on Feb. 11, 2025, for refusing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, the new name Trump had ordered for the body of water. On April 9, 2025, this ban was found to violate the First Amendment by a judge nominated by Trump during his first term.
Denouncing CNN and MSNBC as “illegal” and claiming they are paid political operatives, Trump suggested they should be investigated during a speech at the U.S. Department of Justice.
Trump effectively closed Voice of America, after 83 years of continuous broadcasting, for being “anti-Trump” and radical in its views. By charter, the broadcaster represents “America, not any single segment of American society,” with “accurate, objective, and comprehensive” news and “a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions” through television, radio, internet, social media and satellite broadcasts to peoples around the world.
The Federal Communications Commission has initiated regulatory actions against the licenses of several television stations for broadcasts that have been accused by the President of being anti-Trump or biased in favor of Kamala Harris. Early in the process, the outcomes of these actions are to be determined.
 
Pressuring universities and students

Other administration actions, I believe, raise serious free speech issues.
Harvard isn’t the only university feeling pressure.
The administration is threatening to withhold federal money from universities as a way to coerce many of them to comply with administration policies in ways that implicate free speech and in some instances violate legal processes for the withholding of federal support.
Some of the Trump administration’s recent immigration enforcement efforts have targeted international students who are in the U.S. lawfully but who participated in Palestinian rights protests and disagreed with  Israel’s actions during the war in Gaza.
The administration claims that some students whose visas have been revoked were either Hamas supporters or violated criminal laws. The administration has also said that many students are being deported under broad authority the secretary of state has to deport those deemed a danger to national security.
 
Democracy and free speech
In the past decade, the U.S. has fallen in press freedom, rule of law and democratic governance, resulting in the classification of a “flawed democracy” by the Economist Intelligence Unit, a democratic watchdog. Unsurprisingly, there has been a simultaneous rise in public support for authoritarianism. These changes make support for free speech increasingly important.
On March 4, 2025, Trump declared in a speech before a joint session of Congress that he “stopped all government censorship and brought free speech back to America.”
The record doesn’t support this claim.

He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.
Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.




It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro



Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts
One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”
Bias and language barriers
Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.
“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”
‘Ripple effect’
Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes
Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

Diane was hunting for meat not a trophy, but this moose was a state record. (Photo provided by Diane Carpenter to Carolyn Kozak Loeffler, published with Carpenter family permission)Last month, five large boxes were hand-carried from Alamos, Mexico, across the U.S.-Mexico border to Tucson, Arizona. There, at the local UPS store, they were reboxed before I received the phone call I had been looking forward to for over a year: “They’re ready to ship.” 
These boxes, containing over 600 documents covering nearly 35 different subjects related to the economic and social development of early statehood and rural Alaska, are the personal historical archive of Diane Carpenter — a former longtime resident of Bethel, educator, public servant, bush pilot, mother, community organizer, social activist and significant shaper of Alaska’s early statehood years. 
Although most people outside of the Bethel region have never heard her name, Diane Carpenter’s contributions to Alaska — especially to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta — were immense. The arrival of her collection back in Alaska was six years in the making and made possible by a dedicated team of friends and family in both Alaska and Mexico, and of course, by Diane herself. 
I first encountered Diane’s name while conducting research for Gwen Holdmann, founding director and chief scientist at the Alaska Center for Energy and Power — an applied research group at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Gwen was interested in the work, politics, and people involved in the formation of the Alaska Village Electric Cooperative — a cooperative utility unlike any other in existence. Although the early years of the organization were well documented in the literature, there was almost nothing published about how the organization came to be incorporated back in 1968. AVEC currently serves 59 remote community microgrids in a geographic region larger than any other cooperative utility in the world. 
Most cooperative utilities interconnect their customers through a common transmission network. That was not possible for AVEC due to the immense geographic distances involved. Instead, AVEC owns and operates individual powerhouses and distribution systems in each of these nonroad-connected communities and has been able to navigate operational challenges thanks in no small part to the work of the founders of the organization in formulating the innovative structure and culture that continues to define AVEC today.
Early in January 2024, I was pouring over AVEC-related materials at the Alaska and Polar Regions Collections and Archives at the Elmer E. Rasmuson Library when I came across a letter Diane had written in 1967 addressed to Richard Hausler, a deputy administrator for the Rural Electrification Administration in Washington, D.C. In the letter, she provided comprehensive feedback on a preliminary plan to electrify rural Alaska. Her language was powerful; her understanding of and advocacy for rural Alaska was deep. “The report did not state how much Native people themselves would be involved in the organization and operation of the cooperative,” she writes. “Many of the Native people are beginning to resent their having little or no say regarding programs that affect them; no matter how good the program is, they feel – quite rightly, I think – that their views should be heard and considered.”
She goes on to discuss the organizational structure, local involvement and empowerment, training needs, and much more to create the rural utility that would eventually become AVEC. She closes by saying, “There is no question but that these efforts are worthwhile. My husband and I will be most happy to help further them in any way we can. Best regards. Sincerely yours, Diane Carpenter. Stony River.”

	At this time, the vast majority of remote and rural communities did not have electricity due to many geographic, economic and political challenges. Lack of power service severely limited economic opportunities for rural Alaska residents. Despite many individual community efforts to apply for federal electrification funding, their applications were denied, often citing the enormous construction costs and lack of local economy to repay the loan and pay for continued service.
“Who is this woman?” I asked myself. Mind you, in 1967 the Civil Rights Act was only three years old, race riots occurred in cities throughout the U.S., and women faced legal discrimination in trying to open could be denied were unable to open their own bank accounts for another seven years. 
With the assistance from the archivist, I made a hasty scan of the letter and sent it to Gwen, who then searched online, found Diane’s memoir “In the Winter of the Orange Snow,” bought it in town the next day, and read it. Late the next night, I received this text from Gwen, “This woman’s life was insane.” Gwen meant that in the best way possible, as she herself is no stranger to outdoor adventure and innovative problem-solving while rearing a young family.
We reached out to Diane’s publisher the next morning and were delighted to learn that not only was Diane still alive at the age of 92, but she was working on a second memoir – this one covering the years she homesteaded in Stony River – the years she formed AVEC. The publisher connected us with Diane directly and she graciously agreed to meet virtually from her home in Alamos, Mexico.

	In our first meeting with Diane and her team of supporters, we learned that not only was Diane still an articulate champion of rural Alaska, but she kept meticulous records from her years in the Y-K Delta. Her personal archive captures both her individual perspective of living in rural midcentury Alaska, and also a bigger historical moment in time for our state: A transitional period between achieving statehood, statebuilding and the formal discovery of oil on the North Slope, the development of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System and the subsequent oil wealth that has defined so much of our state’s economy ever since. 
Diane had been working closely with the library in Bethel as well as other close friends and contacts in Alaska on finding a permanent home for her archive where it could be digitized and made accessible to all. Gwen and I both felt strongly about supporting the project however we could, and over the next year, constructed a plan in partnership with Diane, her team in Alaska and Mexico, and the Alaska and Polar Regions Collections and Archives at the UAF Elmer E. Rasmuson Library.
During this time, we had the pleasure of getting to know bits and pieces of Diane’s larger life story. Diane, an expert community organizer, was instrumental in the creation of many valuable programs in service to Alaskans and especially Alaskan women, including the Tundra Women’s Coalition in Bethel. But it was her work coordinating the regional, state, and federal effort that resulted in the successful organization we now know today as AVEC that she was most proud of. Through grassroots local organizing, the pooling of resources, substantial state and federal agency cooperation, and the construction of a thoughtful, deliberate organizational structure to foster community buy-in, Diane and her collaborators created a lasting and innovative utility structure that provided essential power services to communities across Alaska when no one else would. Willie Hensley served as AVEC’s founding president. Diane was VP.
When recently asked why she became so involved in early rural electrification efforts, Diane was quiet and reflective for a moment before replying, “Because I could… and if I didn’t, who would?” In interviews, it is clear that Diane’s deep affection and respect for the communities, families, and people of Western Alaska motivated her work. Her memoir and personal stories time and again tell of a need brought forth by the community and Diane rising and organizing to meet it. She led the incorporation of townships in order to create local schools so school-aged children could stay in their villages; coordinated the construction of powerhouses and airstrips; she founded women’s shelters and safe houses; and she advocated and organized for more equitable health and safety services for rural communities, just to name a few.
After a long battle with cancer, Diane passed away peacefully at home in Alamos last month surrounded by her family and friends. Her story exemplifies both the can-do spirit of the time as well as her own dogged determination and work ethic. Diane accomplished so much in her lifetime, but perhaps her most impactful legacy for current and future generations is her lived example of the power we each have to organize the meaningful and lasting investments we want in our own communities — that collaborative innovation, determination and political will can overcome seemingly impossible challenges. 
Diane’s archive is currently being digitized and processed, but should be available to the public for research within the next 12 months.

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Federal agents were already investigating a secretive state vendor for legislative mailers in May 2020 when Tennessee’s director of legislative administration found out a scandal-ridden staffer was running the company.
Now-retired director Connie Ridley testified Friday in U.S. District Court she was “advised” by the U.S. Department of Justice to keep processing invoices because of a federal investigation into Phoenix Solutions, a company run by ex-staff member Cade Cothren.
Testifying Friday on the fourth day of the corruption trial for former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff Cothren, Ridley said she wouldn’t have approved New Mexico-based Phoenix Solutions as a state vendor if she had known Cothren was behind it.
In the wake of his involvement in a sexist and racist texting scandal that led to his resignation and Casada’s decision to step down in August 2019, Ridley said she had no confidence in Cothren and his judgment. 
Casada, Cothren and former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson were indicted on federal charges in 2022 in connection with an alleged fraud, bribery, theft and money laundering scheme involving the state’s postage and printing program for lawmakers, in which they’re allowed to use state funds to pay for information mailers to constituents. House members receive $3,000 annually and senators $8,000 because their districts are larger.
The prosecution introduced documents showing Cothren, using the alias Matthew Phoenix, formed Phoenix Solutions in December 2019, about three months after he left the Speaker’s office. Smith and Casada allegedly directed business to Cothren in return for kickbacks.

Ridley said Smith, who resigned, pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal authorities, pressured her to make payments to Phoenix Solutions when it filed invoices for work on constituent mailers for former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood and current Reps. Jay Reedy, Paul Sherrell and Esther Helton-Haynes, all of whom are Republican.
Ridley said she initially declined to process the invoices because Phoenix Solutions hadn’t filled out a federal W-9 tax form. 
Prosecutors displayed the IRS tax form, which was filled out under penalty of perjury, showing the signature of “Matthew Phoenix,” the bogus name used by Cothren to hide his identity. Prosecutors say Casada and Smith had to hide Cothren’s name or lawmakers wouldn’t have used the company.
Federal attorneys also showed canceled checks to Phoenix Solutions with Cothren’s signature.
Defense attorneys have admitted that Cothren was “Matthew Phoenix” and that he had to keep his identity secret or he wouldn’t have been able to conduct state business.
Ridley acknowledged she approved Phoenix Solutions as a vendor once it filed the W-9 form. She also required the same for Smith’s company, Rivers Edge Alliance, and Casada’s company, Right Way Consulting and eventually set up direct deposit into bank accounts. 
Most of those invoices from December 2019 through mid-2020 ranged from about $2,500 to $4,500. The total amount involved in the case is $52,000.

Defense attorneys said in their opening statements that federal investigators took aim at Cothren because of his indiscretions as chief of staff, believing he had to be guilty of running an illicit company because he was a “sinner.”
Ridley, who had discretion to approve vendors, said rules for lawmakers’ constituent mailers changed in mid-2020 when questions were being raised about Phoenix Solutions. The House Speaker’s office also had final approval on the mailers to make sure they met state guidelines.
The former director said she got “pushback” from Smith because of the rules, in addition to pressure to pay Phoenix Solutions.
At one point, Ridley said, Smith told her it was a “poor reflection on the state” for Phoenix Solutions not to be paid.
Prosecutors showed an email to Ridley from Smith saying it would be “illegal or unethical” to print and send out mailers without knowing payment was coming.
One email from Matthew Phoenix to a bogus assistant, Candice McKay, said it seemed as if the state’s Legislative Administration Office was “having some drama” and added Tennessee is “not the easiest state to work with.”
In response to cross examination from Cothren’s legal team, Ridley said she had concerns about approving Phoenix Solutions and both Casada’s and Smith’s companies as vendors and that she took her concerns to House Speaker Cameron Sexton. 
“I felt it was a conflict of interest for sitting members of the General Assembly to sell services to other members,” she said. 
Ridley said she did not share her concerns with either Casada or Smith and ultimately, senior staff members for Sexton directed her to pay the invoices for all three companies.

Don Bacon, R-Neb., confirmed Friday that he is considering retiring from Congress, although he is just coming off one of his best fundraising quarters.
Bacon told the Nebraska Examiner that the decision on whether to run for reelection next year will be a family decision, made this summer. 
“I prayed a lot before deciding to run last cycle,” Bacon said. “I’m doing the same now.”
 John Cavanaugh exploring bid 

With the 2026 midterms only a year away, political groups from both sides of the aisle are pouring money and resources into Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District competitive seat. Bacon, who continues to be in the national spotlight as one of the few House Republicans to criticize the Trump administration, just had one of his best fundraising quarters. Now Bacon, 61, is poised to decide whether to pivot to private life. 
State Democrats, who view Bacon’s seat as vulnerable, are still looking for a candidate. However, State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha confirmed to the Examiner that he’s exploring a possible run for Nebraska’s 2nd District, regardless of Bacon’s decision to run or not. The Omaha state senator said he had made calls to feel out a potential run last week.

When asked how the calls went, Cavanaugh said, “Everyone likes me.”
“I am deeply concerned about the failure of the Congress to protect the interests of the people of Nebraska,” Cavanaugh said. “The people of Nebraska deserve a strong voice in Washington.”
He emphasized that he hasn’t made an official decision about running and that he has no set timeline. The last Democratic-aligned state senator, Tony Vargas, who ran against Bacon, has failed twice to unseat him. A Nebraska Democratic Party spokesperson said the party is still in talks with ”strong candidates” for the congressional district, and it will be up to the candidate to determine the timing of an announcement.
“If I am that voice, I will run regardless of who else is running,” Cavanaugh said. 
 Drawing attention

A potential midterm race is becoming clearer after independent Dan Osborn focuses his effort on the U.S. Senate once again. The Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District has already drawn attention from state and national Democrats this year, with Democrats leading in-person town halls and spending media ad buys from multiple Democratic-aligned groups. 
Bacon hauled in $910,000 in donations for the first quarter of fundraising for the year. A campaign spokesperson, Matthew Zacher, said Bacon is focused on ”governing and solving problems for his constituents.”
“This strong fundraising keeps all options open ahead of 2026,” Zacher said. 
The National Republican Congressional Committee flaunted House Republicans’ fundraising efforts for the first quarter, including Bacon. An NRCC spokesperson said Bacon’s “massive fundraising haul underscores how fired up voters are to send him back to Congress.”  
House Republicans who are considered in toss-up races have outpaced vulnerable House Democrats this fundraising cycle. Bacon’s fundraising is below the average of other Republicans considered to be in toss-up districts or learning Republican, according to Roll Call. 
The average for those House Republicans was $977,000.
 Bucked ‘blue dot’

The 2nd District saw roughly $21 million in spending from outside groups during the Bacon-Vargas 2024 race. The candidates raised a combined $10 million. 











This strong fundraising keeps all options open ahead of 2026.

Bacon has fended off Democratic challengers in close races in previous years and has bucked the “blue dot” voting trend for Democrats in the last two presidential elections. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates Bacon’s seat as a Republican toss up.
“Don and Angie will make a decision on seeking another term in the coming months,”  Zacher said.

(Stock photo by Douglas Rissing via Getty Images)The Trump administration has lambasted the Washington attorney general’s lawsuit against a county for cooperating with federal immigration agents in violation of state law. 
The latest development, based on a court filing from the U.S. Department of Justice last week, marks another escalation of tensions between the state and feds over immigration. 
President Donald Trump’s Justice Department is asking a judge to side with Adams County as it faces litigation from Attorney General Nick Brown over the state’s “sanctuary” policy known as the Keep Washington Working Act. 
“Washington asserts KWW is lawful, because it does not ‘impede’ federal officials from accomplishing their work,” DOJ senior litigation counsel J. Max Weintraub wrote. “But that is exactly what KWW was designed to do. And it has accomplished that end — actively facilitating aliens’ evasion of federal law in Washington.”
Weintraub argues that the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, enacted by Congress, preempts the Keep Washington Working Act. And he points to the Constitution’s supremacy clause that holds federal statutes “shall be the supreme Law of the Land.”
“KWW contravenes the Supremacy Clause for a host of independent reasons, and virtually at every turn,” Weintraub wrote.
Brown’s lawsuit against Adams County has also received a stiff rebuke from Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Michael Baumgartner, whose eastern Washington district includes part of the county. 
In a letter, Baumgartner and two other Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee wrote the state “not only actively thwarts federal immigration enforcement, but it also targets local law enforcement officials for complying with federal law.” 
Brown defended the law in a sharply-worded response last week and questioned why his lawsuit was getting such national attention. 
Passed in 2019, the Keep Washington Working Act makes the state a so-called “sanctuary” for immigrants without legal status. President Donald Trump has floated punishing such cities and states, including through withheld federal funding. 
On Thursday, a federal judge in California blocked the Trump administration from taking that kind of recourse over immigration enforcement. Seattle, which has a sanctuary policy of its own, is one of more than a dozen local governments that brought the case.
The state law mostly stops local police from helping federal authorities with immigration enforcement. For example, police can’t provide nonpublic personal information to federal authorities investigating civil immigration cases, and can’t interview or detain people solely based on questions about their immigration status. 
Police also aren’t allowed to ask about their immigration status, except in rare cases.
In his lawsuit last month, Brown alleged the Adams County Sheriff’s Office flouted the law for years. He says deputies unlawfully jailed people based solely on immigration status, enabled federal immigration agents to question those in custody and shared confidential personal information of Washingtonians with federal officials.
In court filings, the county denied the state’s allegations, with arguments about the Keep Washington Working Act that mirror the DOJ. 
In a Friday statement, Brown said the DOJ and Adams County employ “the same factually and legally incorrect arguments.”
“There is no conflict between Keep Washington Working and federal law, and we look forward to continuing to present our case in court,” the attorney general continued.
The complaint, initially filed in state court in Spokane County, has been moved to federal court. The attorney general is looking to move it back to state court because the case is focused on allegations regarding state law, not federal.

U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., said he got confirmation Thursday from the White House that the administration will authorize two meteorologists next week for the NWS office, which will allow it to deploy weather balloons twice a day.

“They’re all smiles,” Flood said, referring to the Valley NWS officials. 
The announcement came after the Weather Service office for the Omaha area and other Great Plains offices announced that they would pause the deployment of weather balloons due to cuts from the Trump administration last month. Trump cut 1,000 jobs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, which includes the National Weather Service. 
Flood was among several in Nebraska’s federal delegation to push back against NWS DOGE cuts. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing his concern about the plan to lay off personnel at NOAA following the recent wave of deadly storms across the country, after telling the Examiner that he would “press the White House” to restore the Weather Service office’s ability to deploy weather balloons.
The rest of Nebraska’s all-GOP delegation expressed concerns about grounding the weather balloons. Flood said he wants to introduce legislation that would reclassify National Weather Service employees as public safety. 
“Had that been in place, this would never have gotten to the point it is,” Flood told the Examiner. 
Weather balloons are a key tool in forecasting. Midwestern meteorologists feared the data loss would have led to forecasting challenges. Flood also provided specifics on the NWS official staffing issues – the office typically has 13 meteorologists but was down to eight. 
Nebraska experienced a blizzard last month, which caused Gov. Jim Pillen to declare a state of emergency for 24 counties. The damage estimates from the blizzard are estimated to be more than $64.8 million. The governor is seeking federal disaster assistance from the Trump Administration, calling the winter storm “one of the most destructive winter weather events to impact Nebraska in recent history.”
Eric Hunt, an agricultural meteorologist with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, told Nebraska Public Media that the “worst-case scenario” involves forecasting accuracy returning to its 2000s levels because it would lead to shorter warning times for potential severe weather and less accurate long-term forecasts.

(Novagold Resources photo)For years, plans to develop Alaska’s largest gold prospect appeared to have stalled amid lawsuits and questions about costs. 
Now, a $1 billion deal could inject new life into the massive Donlin gold project in Western Alaska.
That’s the message, at least, from the investors who are doubling down on Donlin, including two prominent East Coast billionaires. They say they’re more motivated to push the project toward production than the global mining giant that just pulled out.
In a sale announced this week, Barrick Gold Corp., one of the world’s most prolific gold mining companies, will give up its half of Donlin. 
Paulson Advisers, a Florida-based firm led by financier John Paulson, is paying Barrick $800 million for 40% of the project. 
The remaining 10% will go to Novagold Resources for $200 million. Novagold is a publicly traded company that already owned half of the project and has been working on it alongside Barrick for years. 
Barrick, which operates gold and copper mines in the U.S., Africa, South America and the Middle East, brought deep pockets to Donlin, along with expertise as a developer. 
But the company also had competing priorities and wasn’t pressed to move Donlin from exploration into the multibillion-dollar construction phase, Novagold’s chairman, Thomas Kaplan, said at a briefing this week.
Donlin, which is one of the world’s largest gold prospects, is gaining deeper backing from Paulson, a longtime investor in the metal who already owned shares in Novagold. He says he’s poised to bring not only new cash to the project but also fresh intent to speed it along.

“Our goal is to immediately advance this project toward production,” Paulson said at the briefing. 
A coveted, contentious deposit
Donlin has been studied for years and Novagold estimates that it contains deposits of gold worth more than $100 billion. Boosters consider the project to be one of Alaska’s most promising deposits, given its sheer size. But it’s also one of the most contentious. 
Its developers enjoy considerable support from elected officials and Alaska Native-owned corporations, which own the land where Donlin sits. They see the project as an opportunity to create hundreds of jobs and generate revenue for local governments and Indigenous shareholders. 
But Donlin faces staunch opposition from several tribal governments as well as regional and statewide conservation groups. They fear the effects of a large-scale mine in a remote region where people have long depended on salmon and other wildlife and traditional foods. 
Paulson’s investment comes as four separate lawsuits over Donlin’s state and federal permits work their way through the courts — and as questions linger about the economics and logistics of powering a sprawling, open-pit operation. The mine would be built on tundra near the upper reaches of the Kuskokwim River, far from existing roads and the electricity grid.

	Donlin is almost fully permitted but has not moved into construction in part, according to its new owners, because Novagold and Barrick weren’t aligned on how quickly to proceed. 
Traditionally a gold company, Barrick has recently shifted its focus to copper — a key component for electric cars and other modern technologies that some investors consider a more strategic, long-term bet. Barrick has appeared more interested in developing copper mines in other countries than in advancing Donlin, according to industry observers.
“I think what held (Donlin) back in the past was Barrick, through no fault of their own,” Paulson said. “They had many projects around the world. And Donlin was somewhat of an orphan asset.” 
Market analysts at Jefferies, a New York investment bank, echoed Paulson in their own review of the deal. 
“From what we could tell, Donlin was not a priority in Barrick’s portfolio — not anytime soon, anyway — and so we are not surprised by the sale,” the review said.
The analysts added, however, that the deal appears to have come at the right time for Barrick because of rising gold prices — which likely boosted Donlin’s value. 
Gold has hit repeated record-high prices in recent months and is now selling at more than $3,300 per ounce, up some 30% this year.
Barrick appears poised to use cash from the sale to invest in its other mines. In a press release, the company’s chief executive, Mark Bristow, said Donlin “might be better suited in the hands of others, while we pursue our priority portfolio of Barrick-managed growth projects.”
A Barrick spokesperson declined to comment further. 
Kaplan, Novagold’s chairman, said he harbors no ill will toward Barrick and looks forward to celebrating the Donlin deal with Bristow “over a bottle or two or three of very, very fine Bordeaux.” He also said at the briefing, perhaps jokingly, that he almost named one of his children Donlin.

	Kaplan himself is a billionaire investor, who, like Paulson, has long been known for his enthusiasm for gold. His firm, The Electrum Group, invested in Novagold over a decade ago and is now the company’s largest shareholder. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Kaplan made multiple attempts to buy Barrick’s half of Donlin over the past 15 years.
“Donlin for me was the Holy Grail,” Kaplan told the Journal.
Novagold’s stock has jumped nearly 60% since the sale was announced, in a sign that investors view it as a good deal. 
Along the Kuskokwim River, downstream of the Donlin prospect and thousands of miles from Wall Street, the deal elicited a range of opinions. Some said they hadn’t heard about the project’s change in ownership. Others said it made no difference to their opposition.
“It’s scary and frustrating,” said Beverly Hoffman, an elder in Bethel, a Kuskokwim River town and regional hub. As someone who “depends on the food resources to sustain our way of life,” Hoffman said in a phone interview, “it angers me that this money can just be thrown around.”

	Hoffman co-founded Mother Kuskokwim Tribal Coalition, a regional advocacy group that’s fighting Donlin. She said she’d like Paulson, the investor, to come visit her in Bethel. 
“I’ll take him out in a boat,” she said. “I would love to talk salmon with him. I would love to talk birds and berries.”
Like many Bethel residents, Hoffman is a shareholder of the regional, Indigenous-owned company Calista Corp., which owns rights to the minerals at Donlin. 
The corporation, which selected those lands for their mineral potential under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, has strongly supported Donlin, given its potential to pay royalties to Calista and create jobs for shareholders.
“Although there’s this news about a planned ownership change, our vision and our priorities at Calista have not changed,” said Vice President of Corporate Affairs Thom Leonard.
Calista periodically meets with Donlin’s owners, has had a “very positive” history with Novagold and doesn’t expect that to change, Leonard added. “We’re ready to move forward when it’s proven and we believe that it’s safe to do so.” 
A politically connected investor
It still might be too early to say exactly how the sale will affect the mine’s prospects, according to Brett Watson, an economist at the University of Alaska Anchorage who follows the industry closely. 
Watson is waiting to see what changes Novagold and Paulson make to Donlin’s operations this year, and how quickly the owners move to update their economic analysis of the project. 
Before Barrick’s sale, Donlin had announced plans to spend $43 million on exploratory drilling and other operations this year.
As soon as the deal closes, the new ownership team aims to begin a key step toward construction: an $80 million, two-year update of an existing economic study of Donlin, said Novagold’s chief executive, Greg Lang. 
Donlin is already halfway done with its planned drilling for the year, he added. Once the sale is finalized, Lang said in an interview, Novagold and Paulson will look to expand Donlin’s budget, “if appropriate.”

	Paulson originally gained fame by making billions of dollars in a bet against the U.S. housing market leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.
Since then, Paulson has poured large sums into mining, becoming one of the country’s highest-profile gold investors. 
His firm holds a roughly 35% stake in Perpetua Resources, which is building a large mine in Idaho with support from the Trump administration. That project targets gold and antimony — an element that’s surged in value amid a trade war with China — and it recently has progressed quickly from the study phase toward construction.
“We want to repeat that success we’ve had with Perpetua, with Donlin,” Paulson said. “It was a similar mine development as we have here. Only Donlin is much larger.” 
Paulson & Co., Paulson’s family investment office, has other mining interests in Alaska, though the billionaire has largely stayed behind the scenes. 
They include a one-third stake in International Tower Hill Mines, a small company looking to develop a gold deposit north of Fairbanks. The firm also owns nearly 9% of Trilogy Metals, which is seeking to build a copper mine near the end of the controversial, state-proposed Ambler Road in remote Northwest Alaska.   
Beyond investing, Paulson is known for his ties to President Donald Trump. He donated millions of dollars to Trump’s presidential campaign and hosted a fundraiser last year at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. He was floated last year as a potential U.S. treasury secretary pick. 
A spokesperson for Paulson referred a request for comment to Novagold.

Lawmakers double budget for correction ombuds
Democratic state lawmakers have nearly doubled the budget for the state’s new correction ombuds. While Governor Ned Lamont flat-funded the office at $400,000 annually — an amount that both members of the Correction Advisory Committee and Interim Ombuds DeVaughn Ward have said is not nearly enough to perform the ombuds’ necessary duties — including responding to complaints and visiting prison facilities.
Ward told the Committee at a meeting in February that he planned to ask lawmakers for a budget of around $800,000.
The additional money — which increases the ombuds’ budget to a total of $790,800 in 2026 — includes funding for an advanced nurse practitioner, a special investigator, an assistant ombuds and an administrative assistant.
“ That one person [the ombuds] can’t possibly go to the 13 correctional facilities that we have and deal with the number of complaints or concerns that people may have,” Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, told lawmakers at a meeting on Tuesday.

Advocates voice concerns on special ed bills
Advocates for students with disabilities say they’re deeply concerned with some of the provisions in Senate Bill 1561 and House Bill 7277, controversial measures that have also been criticized by some lawmakers.
The legislation have numerous provisions that include changes to how private special education programs can bill for services and a requirement that the Office of Policy Management, along with the state Department of Education, create fixed costs for services for students that are outsourced to other school districts.
On Wednesday, the Connecticut Council of Administrators of Special Education and Special Education Equity for Kids of Connecticut came together to send a letter voicing their criticism to the lawmakers that have championed those bills. They said that the rate setting provisions in SB 1561 and HB 7277 have numerous flaws, including the short time frame of just six months for designing and implementing a rate setting system, as well as assigning that job to the Office of Policy Management, which they argue is not equipped with the educational expertise to take on this task. While the groups said they agree with some of the proposals, they believe the others would have a “devastating” impact on special education students.
The groups asked Gov. Ned Lamont to convene a Blue Ribbon Commission that would include parents, administrators, economists, and other experts to assess whether a rate-setting system is feasible, and, if so, detail recommendations for that system. The groups said that while they favor some aspects of the legislation, they requested to meet with lawmakers to work together to improve the proposed bills.

Work, live, ride
A bill known as Work, Live, Ride that would push towns to build more housing near train and bus stations passed the Appropriations Committee on Thursday. The legislation includes funding to increase staffing at the Office of Responsible Growth, which would be tasked with helping towns figure out their zoning and planning development.
Under the bill, certain funding for municipalities would be prioritized for towns that adopt zoning to increase residential density near public transit, a concept known as transit-oriented development.
Supporters say it would increase housing supply, which the state desperately needs, and benefit the environment by encouraging more people to use public transportation.
Opponents fear it would weaken local control and that the prioritization of funding would mean towns that don’t join the program would miss out on money they need for infrastructure projects.
The additional positions at the Office of Responsible Growth would mean the need for an appropriation of about $250,000 in the state budget, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill. It passed the committee with a 40-14 vote, and next heads to the House.

Public defender eligibility
Lawmakers and the governor appear to be at odds over who should be eligible for public defender services in the state.
In February, Lamont unveiled a budget that reduced eligibility for public defender services from 250 percent of the poverty level — $80,375 for a family of four — to 200 percent of the poverty level, or $64,300 for a family of four.
Lamont’s proposal would reverse the expansion that the legislature made in 2022, which has only just begun to take effect since January.
Deborah del Prete Sullivan, legal counsel for the Office of Public Defenders, said that before the increase in eligibility, even someone making minimum wage couldn’t qualify for public defender representation.
“These are not people who are making a lot of money at all,” del Prete Sullivan told the appropriations committee in February, just after the governor’s budget was unveiled.
The appropriations committee budget restores funding for 20 public defender positions originally removed from the governor’s budget. Del Prete Sullivan noted in February that the department had hired people to cover the anticipated increase in caseload, and that reducing the eligibility level would mean either having to lay people off or institute a hiring freeze.
Connecticut public defenders represented people in over 118,000 cases in 2024.

Free bus fare for high school students
The $55.7 billion two-year budget adopted by the legislature’s Appropriations Committee this week includes $3 million in both fiscal years 2026 and 2027 to provide free bus fare for high school students. The Transportation Committee also passed a separate measure to provide discounted and free bus rides to high school students as well as veterans. That proposal, which is not included in the version of the budget passed by the Appropriations Committee, requires the Department of Transportation to create a program allowing certain high school students to ride buses for free or discounted fares, as well as free bus fare to veterans.
“The [Transportation Committee] proposal is a recognition that these are two important groups of public transit riders and we need to support efforts to get them connected to places of work, education, recreation and home,” said Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, co-chair of the Transportation Committee. “I think the Appropriations package takes a significant step in supporting this effort.”

Riparian ‘buffer’ bill advances
The area around rivers, streams and wetlands known as the “riparian zone” would enjoy greater protections from development under a bill advanced by state lawmakers on Friday.
The legislation, House Bill 7174, gives the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, along with local wetlands commissions, the ability to regulate activities within a 100 foot buffer zone surrounding any waterway or wetland. Currently, those agencies only regulate activities within the boundary of the wetlands itself.
Proponents of the bill argue that it is necessary to help protect riparian areas from over development, which can have negative impacts on habitats, water quality and flood control.
“These buffer areas around streams help to alleviate some of the major flooding by controlling erosion, and fostering native soils,” said Rep. Brandon Chaffee, D-Middletown.
Critics, however, argued that the legislation amounted to massive expansion of those agencies’ regulatory powers.
Rep. Doug Dubitsky, R-Chaplin, proposed several amendments to the bill — some of which were technical in nature, and another that would have reduced the buffer zone to 10 feet — that were voted down by the majority Democrats on the Planning and Development Committee.
“There are better ways to ensure that we have clean water in this state, than to essentially take over large swaths of the land mass of this state,” Dubitsky said.
The bill makes several other minor changes to the powers held by local wetlands commissions, and allows the commissioner of DEEP to develop regulations for fish passageways at certain dams.
The Planning and Development Committee voted to advance the bill Friday, following similar approval by members of the Environment Committee. The bill now heads to the House for further consideration.

Vermont’s largest public transit agency is now, as a result, weighing new training for its bus drivers on how to interact with federal agents. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Feds threaten states’ transportation funding over noncompliance with immigration enforcement.","Green Mountain Transit buses drive down Main Street in Burlington on May 14, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerPresident Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday told states and other recipients of federal transportation funding that they could lose those dollars if they do not comply with the White House’s interpretation of federal laws — including on immigration.The guidance, outlined in a letter from U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, told recipients that their obligations, by taking federal funding, included “cooperating with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” as well as other agencies, “in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.”Failing to do so would “compromise the safety and security of the transportation systems supported by DOT financial assistance,” the missive states, as well as “prioritize illegal aliens over the safety and welfare of the American people.” The four-page letter also takes aim at diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, calling them “discriminatory” and saying that states and others “must ensure that the personnel practices (including hiring, promotions, and terminations) within their organizations are merit-based and do not discriminate.”Duffy said, without providing specifics, that there had been instances in which recipients of federal funding did not cooperate with “ICE investigations,” and that some recipients had “issued driver’s licenses to individuals present in the United States in violation of Federal immigration law,” which he suggested would be grounds for losing federal dollars. Since 2014, Vermont has allowed people who live in the state — but who do not have lawful status or U.S. citizenship — to get “driver’s privilege” cards. It’s one of 19 states, along with Washington, D.C., that offer “driving privileges to unauthorized immigrants,” according to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures.Clayton Clark, general manager of Green Mountain Transit, outlines proposed reductions in local bus service at a public hearing in Burlington on Sept. 11, 2024. File photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerVermont’s largest public transportation agency, Green Mountain Transit, funds about two-thirds of its operations with federal money and received the letter from Duffy on Thursday, said Clayton Clark, the agency’s general manager. Clark said the agency is, as a result, working on new training for what its drivers and other employees should do if federal immigration agents board a bus or come to one of the agency’s transit hubs in downtown Burlington or Montpelier. The state Agency of Transportation got the letter late Thursday, said Amy Tatko, an agency spokesperson, in an email Friday, and is in the process of reviewing it. In the state’s budget for the current fiscal year, which ends in June, federal funds make up almost 60% of transportation spending, according to the Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Office.Joe Flynn, the transportation secretary, said in a brief emailed statement that the letter “requires further understanding,” especially about the Trump administration’s intentions, but added the state agency is “not overly concerned at this time” about what it says.Clark said that Green Mountain Transit — which operates local and commuter bus services, as well as on-demand transit for people with certain medical needs, across Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle and Washington counties — would, broadly, tell its employees to comply with federal immigration enforcement officials. “We would not want them to interfere — but we also would not want them to, you know, be aiding,” Clark said. The agency’s staff has not had any such interactions with federal immigration enforcement so far, he said in an interview Friday morning. Still, Clark said he is concerned by the nature of recent detentions by federal agents in Vermont and other states that took place with little warning and were conducted by officers wearing plainclothes and masks. This could make it difficult, for instance, for the agency’s employees to get a clear sense of what was happening, Clark said. He noted that Green Mountain Transit’s No. 56 bus stops just down the street from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Colchester where Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist and lawful U.S. resident, was arrested earlier this month in that manner. Clark said he expects that some people use the No. 56 to get to appointments at that office. “When folks are not in uniform, not wearing any type of identification that would let you know what organization they’re from,” Clark said, “how do we know that this is ICE — and not somebody who’s, you know, trafficking New Americans?” Clark said he is concerned that the prospect of immigration enforcement raised by Duffy’s letter could discourage people from taking public transportation. But he said Green Mountain Transit could not afford to put its federal funding at risk, regardless of how he felt, personally, about this week’s federal guidance.He estimated that the agency, which is already facing steep financial challenges and has had to cut some services in recent months, would only be able to provide about 20% of the service that it currently offers if it were to lose all of its federal funding.Green Mountain Transit has already made one change to its operations in response to recent actions by the Trump administration, Clark said. After learning the administration could target federal funds used for what are — at least in the White House’s view — diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, Clark said, the transit agency pulled the plug on its “Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee” meant to ensure its services were meeting the needs of people from historically marginalized communities. The agency made the decision to disband the committee in March, Clark said. Trump has taken aim at what he considers “DEI” programs in government and the private sector from the outset of his second term. His billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s cost-cutting “government efficiency” department has, meanwhile, repeatedly targeted federal jobs for cuts that it has said were related to diversity and inclusion efforts. Clark said Green Mountain Transit plans to replace its “JEDI” committee with “rider engagement” committees, still aimed at soliciting feedback from its passengers.At the statewide level, the Trump administration earlier this year put federal grants for some major transportation projects under “review,” including large new bridges and a planned buildout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the state. During Gov. Phil Scott’s weekly press conference on Wednesday, Flynn, the transportation secretary, said in response to a question that the EV funding was the only pot of transportation money he knew of at that point that was still under threat.Sen. Richard Westman, R-Lamoille, who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee, said Friday that he was concerned by the position that the letter put the state in. He said it is difficult, if not impossible, to predict what steps the Trump administration will take, and noted the state’s transportation revenue challenges gave it little flexibility.“I wouldn’t want to comply,” he said, referring to the immigration enforcement described in Duffy’s memo, among other measures. “But I can’t afford to live without the money.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Feds threaten states’ transportation funding over noncompliance with immigration enforcement.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/buses-1-20240514.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 20:05:51.691968

(Courtesy of Ann Moylan Fiala, Ainsworth Volunteer Fire Department)A Friday morning update from Ainsworth Fire Chief Brad Fiala, shared through the local KBRB Radio station, indicates the north-central Nebraska Plum Creek Fire is up to 70% contained as crews continue to battle the fire west and north of Johnstown in Brown County.
The fire started Monday afternoon after a private landowner’s prescribed burn done in coordination with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, local fire departments and other partners escaped containment, according to local and state officials.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen issued a statewide burn ban Wednesday afternoon through the end of April, when the fire was 0% contained and 6,631 acres had been burned. By Thursday morning, the fire was 40% contained.
Game and Parks is enforcing a temporary campfire ban across its properties.
Many outside resources that were called to assist will depart the area Friday, according to Fiala’s update. The two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from the Nebraska National Guard that had been on scene will still make water drops on interior hot spots Friday.
“We are trying to work hot spots and smoldering areas now,” Fiala said in the update. “You are still going to see smoke in there for the next couple [of] weeks.”
Fiala said warmer temperatures and strong winds are expected to return to the area Sunday, which could complicate the response as crews continue fighting.
Landowners are encouraged to help local volunteer fire departments monitor the area. One cabin was destroyed and 45 cattle were killed, and a few people lost their deer stands. Crews have managed to save other houses and structures in the area.

CoreCivic, a private company that manages the Crossroads Correctional Center in Shelby, said Friday it will appeal the decision.
The victim, Nathaniel Lake, was convicted of a crime he maintained he did not commit, and he was transferred to CoreCivic’s prison in Shelby, according to a news release Friday from the law firm representing him, Heenan and Cook of Billings. The Montana Supreme Court later overturned that conviction.
“While there, Mr. Lake was assaulted by another inmate serving a double life sentence without parole for deliberate homicide who had previously assaulted 11 times,” the news release said.
The original complaint filed in Toole County District Court in December 2021 said CoreCivic had been named in multiple lawsuits around the country with allegations based on “inmate injuries and deaths inflicted by other inmates.”
The lawsuit said a 2016 U.S. Department of Justice audit found CoreCivic routinely had insufficient staffing.
It also said a 2021 presidential order prohibited the DOJ to renew contracts with private prison operators, including CoreCivic, “noting that such facilities do not provide safe living or working conditions” compared to publicly operated ones.
CoreCivic maintains it takes safety seriously. In January 2025, the Brennan Center for Justice said the Trump administration reversed the order against private prison contracts.
According to the news release, the assailant “buzzed” out of his own locked pod and into Lake’s locked pod in the 2018 attack.
“He then went to Mr. Lake’s cell and beat and choked him for over 3 1/2 minutes undetected by any jailers,” the news release said. “A jailer found Mr. Lake at lockdown count and he was life-flighted to a hospital in Great Falls.”
The complaint said the assailant moved quickly, “no CCC staff intervened in the attack on Lake,” and he was allowed to “freely roam the prison between units without staff intervention.”
Lake was in a coma for 33 days and spent four months in the ICU, the lawyers said. Lake is also represented by Bechtold Law in Missoula.
The complaint said Lake had a “significant history of mental health issues” and was designated as a sex offender at the time, which made him more vulnerable to an attack.
But it said Lake maintained his innocence of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, and the news release said the conviction didn’t stick.
After being released from the hospital, Lake returned to CoreCivic for six months, but was released when the Montana Supreme Court overturned his conviction.
The complaint said the Missoula County Attorney’s Office declined to refile charges, and Lake has no criminal record.
In a statement, lawyer John Heenan said the award delivers on the request of the team’s client. The lawyers said the jury found “deliberate indifference” on the part of CoreCivic.
“In the face of a company that flatly refused to accept any responsibility for its conduct, we told the jury that Mr. Lake didn’t want sympathy, he wanted justice,” Heenan said. “The jury resoundingly rejected CoreCivic’s excuses and delivered justice.”
Based in Tennessee, CoreCivic describes itself as one of the largest corrections operators in the country. In an email, spokesperson Ryan Gustin said CoreCivic will appeal the decision.
“We take the safety and well-being of every person in our care very seriously,” Gustin said. “We respectfully disagree with this decision, don’t believe it reflects the facts of the case, and will appeal it on several legal grounds.”
The complaint said the prisoner who assaulted Lake was criminally charged with two counts of aggravated assault, pleaded guilty to the first count, and was sentenced to 15 years at the Montana State Prison with no time suspended.
Lake suffered a traumatic brain injury under CoreCivic’s negligent supervision, which had severe and permanent consequences, the complaint said: “He will likely require care for the rest of his life.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-865986514-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-04-25 19:07:44.210515

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Although older teens could work unlimited hours, they wouldn’t be able to get treatment for sexually transmitted infections on their own under two bills the Florida House approved Friday.
House lawmakers voted on party lines both to require parental consent for health care providers to treat minors with STIs and to let 16- and 17-year-olds work full-time hours during the school year without their parents’ permission.
The passage of the bills rolling back child labor laws (HB 1225) and exceptions entitling minors to privacy with doctors (HB 1505) prompted ardent debate from Democrats, who raised concerns about children who may be too afraid to report abuse.
Orlando Democratic Rep. Rita Harris put forward a failed amendment allowing minors 16 and older to get treatment for STIs without parental consent.
“There is definitely space for people who are 16 or 17 to be able to make decisions on their own, as it was stated,” Harris said. “They drive a car. We trust them to get behind a car, which could literally kill people and kill themselves.”
It didn’t come up during Friday’s debate, but the legislation co-sponsored by Lake Mary Republican Rep. Rachel Plakon also would remove a “loophole” in Florida law that allows physicians to prescribe birth control to a minor if their medical opinion is that the patient would suffer health hazards otherwise.


Plakon said she wants parents to have greater involvement over their kids’ health decisions than institutions.
“The overwhelming majority of parents want to do the right thing for their children, and we believe that the passing of this legislation is a restoration of parental rights with health care and will foster better communication between parents and their children,” Plakon said. 
Parental consent doesn’t apply to minors whose parents are being investigated for a crime against them. The Senate version, SB 1288, has not been scheduled for a floor vote. 
Additionally, the change could come at a time when Florida teens are contracting chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis at the highest rates since 2008, according to 2023 data from the Florida Department of Health. Those infections can be cured with antibiotics, but worsen if left untreated.
Seventeen-year-old Adriana Rodas views the bills in juxtaposition to each other. The South Floridian traveled to Tallahassee in March to testify against HB 1505. 
“I think saying that [teens] are only old enough to do one thing, and that one thing also happens to benefit the people who want to make this legislation pass, is hypocritical because it just shows to me that they always say they care about children, but then when it comes to having them work longer hours, which deteriorates mental health and can really slow them down academically, they don’t care,” Rodas said in an interview with Florida Phoenix.

Repealing labor laws
Lawmakers then approved the bill loosening working laws for young Floridians, which Democrats decried as a chance for employers to exploit minors, by a vote of 78-30. 
Specifically, the bill would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to work shifts longer than eight hours on the day before a school day and more than 30 hours in a week while school is in session. The bill loosens restrictions for 14- and 15-year-old home-school students, online students, and those who’ve graduated. 
Employers wouldn’t have to give 30-minute breaks to older teens under the bill. 
“In Florida, we’re requiring parental rights for many other things, like field trips, school presentations, and even, previously, this bill that just moved, kids would need parental rights for STI treatment,” said Jacksonville Democratic Rep. Angie Nixon.
Florida now allows waivers signed by parents. guardians, or school superintendents for young people to work beyond restrictions spelled out in state law, but Republicans argued that the ultimate permission is granted by parents, and a waiver should not be required. 
Rep. Monique Miller, a Republican representing Palm Bay and the bill’s sponsor, said that, because of “a resurgence in apprenticeships and such, we want to reduce barriers to teenagers learning their trade.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office drafted the legislation, Orlando Weekly reported.
The bill makes Florida’s minor labor laws stricter in one aspect. It was amended to prohibit students from working past 10 p.m. on school nights. Florida law now allows students to work until 11:00 p.m. 
The Senate version of the bill, SB 918, has not moved since its first committee stop, when it passed on a 5-4 vote. That bill, and the original version of the House bill, would’ve let minors work overnight on school nights. 
During its last committee stop, the bill was amended to speed up a preemption established last year, when lawmakers voted to eliminate local living-wage laws, specifically for government contractors, effective in 2026. The 2025 bill revises that preemption to take effect this year.

A diverse group of students testified before the House and Senate education committees Friday, singing the praises of their small schools and urging the state to preserve DEI programming.

Photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerAs lawmakers toil away trying to reform Vermont’s school funding and governance systems, they’ve declared better student outcomes a principal goal. Well, on Friday, the students themselves showed up to testify on H.454, as well as on efforts from the administration of President Donald Trump to cut diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools. And while the youth had lots of positives to say about their schools, they weren’t so effusive about where lawmakers are headed. “When I first read the governor’s proposal,” Zoe Epstein, a Champlain Valley Union High School junior said, “I was shocked by the absence of student input.”Lawmakers often hear the same voices again and again, but the students who showed up before the House and Senate education committees Friday represented Vermont in all its complexity. The committees received testimony from public and private school students. Rural students and students from the state’s largest district. Students who have experienced racism, homelessness and those for whom English is a second language. Almost all the students who spoke praised the individualized experiences small classes and schools provide. “Consolidation may ease the burden on taxpayers,” Willow Sharma, a Brattleboro Union High School student said, but “small schools mean so much for our Vermont communities.”Students at the Long Trail School, an independent school in Dorset, warned lawmakers of the diminished opportunities that restricting school choice would have on kids like themselves.Attending the private school would have been “entirely out of my family’s financial ability without school choice,” Morgan Cable, a Long Trail student, said.From southern Vermont to the Champlain Valley, high school students urged lawmakers to preserve or expand diversity, equity and inclusion programming, especially as the state grapples with confusing federal demands to end “illegal DEI.”“As a person of color growing up in Vermont, I spent a lot of time in spaces that weren’t made for people like me,” Arena Coryer, a Colchester High School student, said, but DEI gives her “hope” not just for herself but “every student who’s ever felt like they didn’t belong.”Though most students focused on the laudable outcomes they see in their small schools, Max Demaine, a student at Lake Region Union High School, addressed the economic aspects of lawmakers’ and Gov. Phil Scott’s policy proposals. He pointed out that his Northeast Kingdom district, which serves a high proportion of economically disadvantaged students, spends far less than many schools in the state. Yet lawmakers were considering consolidating rural schools like his and allowing wealthy districts to keep spending more per student. “Why not make other schools have the same model as us?” he asked. — Ethan WeinsteinIn the knowPresident Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday told states and other recipients of federal transportation funding that they could lose those dollars if they do not comply with the White House’s interpretation of federal laws — including on immigration.The guidance, outlined in a letter from U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, told recipients that their obligations, by taking federal funding, included “cooperating with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” as well as other agencies, “in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.”Duffy said, without providing specifics, that there had been instances in which recipients of federal funding did not cooperate with “ICE investigations,” and that some recipients had “issued driver’s licenses to individuals present in the United States in violation of Federal immigration law,” which he suggested would be grounds for losing federal dollars. Since 2014, Vermont has allowed people who live in the state — but who do not have lawful status or U.S. citizenship — to get “driver’s privilege” cards. It’s one of 19 states, along with Washington, D.C., that offer “driving privileges to unauthorized immigrants,” according to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures.Read more about the letter and responses later at VTDigger.org.— Shaun RobinsonOn the moveThe Legislature has approved S.28, which makes technical changes that strengthen protections enacted last year for people who practice “legally protected health care activity” in Vermont, including reproductive health services and gender-affirming care. The Senate also approved S.131, an amendment to the charter of the City of Burlington that would ban the carrying of guns into bars and other places that serve alcoholic beverages.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers continue to debate the first increase to the gas tax in 20 years, with the House on Friday narrowly advancing a 5-cent tax increase while the Senate unanimously defeated a separate bill with a 3-cent increase.
Supporters in the House said the increase is needed to adequately maintain roads and bridges. A 5-cent increase to the motor fuels tax, which includes gasoline and diesel, would put North Dakota at 28 cents, still competitive with neighboring states.
Members of the Senate, meanwhile, objected to raising the gas tax while at the same time trying to cut property taxes, which has been a primary goal of the legislative session.
Lawmakers debate 3-cent gas tax increase, hike in EV registration fee

“It doesn’t make sense to the Senate to offer and promise property tax relief, and then we tax you on the backside of something else that everybody uses,” said Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg.
The 5-cent gas tax proposal is contained in the North Dakota Department of Transportation budget, Senate Bill 2012. House members voted 61-31 to advance the budget, but the gas tax amendment to the bill only passed by a 47-42 margin. 
North Dakota has not increased the motor fuels tax since 2005. Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby, said vehicles have become more efficient in that time, leading to a leveling off or decline in overall gas tax revenue to support road projects.
“This is a fairness tax or a fairness levy,” Nelson said. “The people who are using the roads are the ones paying for it.”
Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown, said the gas tax revenue is not keeping pace with the inflation the Department of Transportation is seeing with construction costs. The tax increase is estimated to raise an additional $70 million.
Supporters also said the dollars are needed to get federal matching funds for road projects.
“This is about safety, this is about fixing our roads, even our rest areas,” said Rep. David Monson, R-Osnabrock. “We have so many needs in North Dakota.”
Others in the House urged a no vote on the tax increase, arguing that it would lead to the state spending more taxpayer money. 
“This is a tax on our family, our friends and our constituents,” said Rep. Dan Johnston, R-Kathryn. “And the state is flush with money.”
Across the hall, the Senate voted 45-0 against House Bill 1382, which would raise the motor fuels tax to 26 cents per gallon and increase registration fees for electric vehicles. It’s estimated to raise an additional $42 million for counties, cities and townships to use on road projects.
“This bill would place a heavy burden on North Dakota residents since 80% of all the fuel purchased in the state is by our residents,” said Sen. Michelle Powers, R-Fargo. “We would be asking for approximately $50 to $100 per year from our constituents, mainly affecting our rural communities.”
She also said supporters of the gas tax increase have lamented that the gas tax has not been increased in more than 20 years.
“Just because a tax hasn’t been raised doesn’t mean it should be raised,” she said.
The gas tax in Minnesota is 32 cents per gallon, 28 cents in South Dakota and 33 cents in Montana.
The Department of Transportation budget is going to a conference committee, which meets Saturday. The House also added to the bill $155 million in bonding to finance the four-laning of 19 miles of U.S. Highway 85, including a sensitive 6-mile stretch through the Badlands south of Watford City.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)When House Bill 145, aimed at raising nonresident base hunting license fees from $15 to $100, moved through committee hearings, the legislation saw opposition from the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association who thought the increase “drastic.”  
Gov. Greg Gianforte agreed, and on Tuesday sent the bill back to the legislature with a recommended amendment for a more moderate increase — to just $50. 
“Like the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association and other conservation groups, I support a modest increase of the nonresident base hunting license fee, but believe the increase from $15 to $100 is too great,” Gianforte wrote in his amendatory veto letter. 
The shift from $100 down to $50 still represents a 230% increase from the existing license fee. Forty dollars of each fee goes to fund access programs for hunters, including the Block Management Program, and will generate an additional $2.5 million, according to projections from the governor’s budget office. 
The House and Senate on Thursday both approved of the governor’s amendment. 
“This has been a really entertaining bill,” Rep. Gary Parry, R-Colstrip, said on the House floor. “It started out at 100, you go to committee, they drop it to 50, then it comes back from the Senate up to 100. I’m going ‘Yeah, no,’ I don’t even know in committee which one I’m supposed to defend. 
“Anyway, so the governor got it and he said ‘No, gonna be 50,’ and here we are complaining we got so much money in the budget, I’m trying to give him more money and he’s taking it away. So, let’s concur.”  
Parry said he was concerned that if the House rejected the amendment, the governor would exercise one of the executive branch’s check on legislative power and issue an outright veto. 
Montana’s governor has three versions of veto power over legislation that reaches his desk. 
The most basic is the outright veto, when the governor decides, for any reason, that he does not agree with a bill passed by the Legislature. A two-thirds vote by both chambers — conducted as normal business if in session, by a mail poll after adjournment, or during a special session — can override a veto. 
Gianforte also holds the power to issue individual line item vetoes in bills that appropriate state funds, while approving the bulk of the bill — a power shared by 44 state governors. 
Line item vetos don’t often receive much attention, as they often involve ensuring a budget is balanced, but a case in Wisconsin drew national attention in 2023 when Democratic Gov. Tony Evers removed a few words in a 158-page budget bill to increase school funding for 400 years, instead of the intended two. 
Montana’s governor can also recommend amendments to bills, officially called an “amendatory veto.” Similar to amendments made in a legislative committee, altered bills must be approved by both chambers and then returned to the governor for final consideration.
If one or both chambers reject the amendments, the bill returns to the governor in its original form, where he could then opt to veto it outright. If only one chamber approves of the recommendations, a conference committee may be convened to hammer out the differences. 
On Thursday, the House and Senate approved of the governor’s amendments to several bills in addition to House Bill 145. 
Changes to Senate Bill 45, which creates a judicial performance evaluation system for sitting judges, removed a section which would have added the evaluation information to the state’s voter information pamphlet.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)After the arrest of Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan by federal agents Friday morning, the city’s political and activist communities responded forcefully, protesting against the arrest across the city. 
Dugan was charged with obstruction of justice and harboring an individual after a group of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agents showed up outside of her courtroom last week to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. 
The criminal complaint against Durgan alleges she broke the law by allowing Flores-Ruiz to use a side door in her courtroom to exit without going past the agents. The agents saw him leave and later apprehended him on foot. 
While a larger protest took place outside of the federal courthouse in downtown Milwaukee, local resident Jeneca Wolski stood alone outside of the county courthouse where Dugan was arrested.
“[I’m] just a local citizen who is horrified that we are finding ourselves in this position right now,” Wolski told the Wisconsin Examiner. “We’re sliding downhill so fast. I don’t want to be looked back on by history as part of it. We have to do everything we can to kick and fight and scream to save our democracy right now.” 
At a press conference, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley accused the administration of President Donald Trump of acting to intimidate “anyone who opposes these policies.” Crowley added that Dugan was arrested by a “large, performative showing” of federal agents in the county courthouse. 
 “We have an obligation to administer our courts in a safe, efficient manner that delivers due process for anyone,” Crowley said. “The Trump administration’s actions are clearly preventing us from doing so by intimidating judges and eroding public faith in our judicial system.” 
People gathered outside the federal courthouse in Milwaukee Friday afternoon to protest Dugan’s arrest. At the rally, Christine Neumann Ortiz, executive director of immigrant rights group Voces De La Frontera, told the Wisconsin Examiner the Trump administration was trying to undermine efforts to oppose its immigration policies.
“They basically want to be unleashed to do whatever they want to commit these raids in courtrooms across the country,” she said. “They don’t want any resistance from judges or from the community standing up for people’s due process rights or limiting their policies of mass deportation and racism.”
Seven of the city of Milwaukee’s legislative representatives said in a joint statement that Dugan’s arrest and ICE operating inside the courthouse will “lead to a breakdown of civil society.”
“The County Courthouse is a sanctuary for justice and peace where the accused come forward willingly in a fair and unbiased process,” said the lawmakers, Sens. Chris Larson and Tim Carpenter and Reps. Christine Sinicki, Darrin Madison, Supreme Moore Omokunde, Angelito Tenorio and Sequanna Taylor. “Arresting people out of a courtroom will lead to a breakdown of civil society. We do not support the presence of ICE in places where it will lead to intimidation against witnesses and victims of crimes, denying everyone involved the justice they deserve.”
U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, questioned how Dugan’s arrest makes the country safer. 
“The Trump Administration continues to test the limits of our Constitution — this time by arresting a sitting judge for allegedly obstructing an immigration operation at the courthouse,” Durbin said. “When immigration enforcement officials interfere with our criminal justice system, it undermines public safety, prevents victims and witnesses from coming forward, and often prevents those who committed crimes from facing justice in the United States. How does this make America any safer? How does arresting a sitting judge make America any safer? It is imperative that Judge Dugan is afforded due process and the presumption of innocence, as required by our Constitution and her fundamental rights as an American.”
State Senate Minority Leader Diane Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety, criticized the arrest in a joint statement. 
“Today’s arrest of a sitting judge, at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, is a frightening escalation of the Trump Administration’s attacks on America’s judicial system,” they said. “This is part of a pattern by this Administration – defying court orders, flouting the democratic system of checks and balances, ignoring the right to due process, and threatening judicial independence – that alarms us as legislators and as residents of this great state and this great country. We will follow this case closely. We will continue to stand up to lawless and unconstitutional actions. And, we will always fight for a bedrock principle of American democracy: equal justice under the law.”
The Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, an activist group, was planning protests Friday afternoon outside the federal courthouse and Saturday outside the FBI’s Milwaukee field office. In a statement, the group said the arrest was a “heinous attack.” 
“They are seeking to send a clear message: either you play along with Trump’s agenda, or pay the consequences,” the group said. “During this period of racist and political repression, we must stand together to denounce today’s actions by the FBI. What happened to Dugan is not new. The FBI and other agencies have been emboldened in recent months, snatching people off the streets, separating families, terrorizing communities, breaking doors down of pro-Palestine activists, and contributing to the unjust deportation of immigrants who don’t have criminal records. What is new is that they have gone after a judge.”

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.



They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo courtesy of a participant who asked not to be identified) An unlicensed dog breeder from California who was caught on an audio recording has been fined $15,400 for offering puppies for sale Easter weekend at a Las Vegas class offering “Puppies & Yoga.” 
It’s illegal to sell dogs without a breeder’s license in Clark County, which is enduring a critical animal overpopulation crisis. A bill before state lawmakers would prohibit retail pet sales statewide.
“I don’t need a license,” the breeder, Denise Gottlieb, told the Current when reached by phone. “I do this all over the country.” 
An activity report obtained by the Current from Clark County Animal Control says Gottlieb of Pinon Springs, CA, had 11 puppies and three adult dogs at a Puppies & Yoga class Easter weekend at Kalma Events in Commercial Center.
“Fines for illegal selling of puppies range from a minimum of $500 per count or the sale price or offered sale price of the animal,” Clark County spokesperson Yazmin Beltran said via email.  “Fines have ranged from $500-$5,000 per count.”
In 2024, the county issued citations for 94 counts of illegal sales of puppies, with fines totaling $201,250. So far in 2025, the county has issued fines totaling $46,700 for 36 counts of illegal sales.  
Gottlieb, when confronted by Animal Control officers who were tipped off to the event on April 19 by Nevada Voters for Animals, denied she was selling the puppies and refused to provide her identification to officers, who she alleged cited her because she called them the “f-cken dog catcher,” according to the county’s activity report.  
Gottlieb “became very confrontational,” the report says, when officers told her they “received statements and audio as evidence” of the attempted sales. Gottlieb can be heard on the recording offering one puppy for $750 and another for $1,295. 
“I could have walked out of there with a puppy, with no adoption record, nothing,” says one of two animal rescuers who attended the class and recorded Gottlieb. The Current agreed not to identify the sources out of concern for retaliation.
The county’s report says a man identified as Edgar, the owner of the business, told Animal Control officers via phone that “he has the breeder’s (sic) sign a contract stating that the sale of animals is not permitted on the property or during class,” however, officers did not ask to see the contract, according to a County spokesperson. 
Gottlieb said she was unaware of such a contractual provision. 
The Current was unable to find a local business license for Puppies & Yoga, which operates in 14 states, according to its website. 
Puppies and Yoga did not respond to numerous requests for comment.  
Wellness trend or commoditization?
“I feel like they are using puppies for money,” said one of the two animal advocates who tipped off authorities to the attempted sales. 
Puppies and Yoga Las Vegas charges $69 per person and advertises as many as five classes a day on the weekend, each for about 20 people.
“Our puppies come from breeders who recognize the importance of early socialization and want their puppies to be well-socialized before moving to their new homes,” says Puppies & Yoga’s website.
Yoga classes featuring small animals such as puppies, kittens, goats, and rabbits are a popular trend.  Animal advocates are increasingly concerned, noting potential emotional and physical trauma can befall small animals, and citing health concerns, such as intestinal parasites that are common in puppies and can be transmitted to other dogs and to humans. 
Italy’s Ministry of Health has banned “puppy yoga” classes, the BBC reports, saying it was aware that organizers “borrow” puppies from breeders.
Gottlieb can be heard on the recording saying she brings the puppies to town every weekend. It’s unknown whether the puppies were used in subsequent yoga classes on Saturday. 
The company did not respond to requests for comment on whether it has considered using its events to assist shelters and rescues with adoptions. 
“We’ve done puppy yoga as a fundraiser twice,” said one of the Current’s sources, who operates an animal rescue. “But all of the money goes back to the rescue.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/more-cropped-puppy-art-1024x760.jpg,,,2025-04-25 19:07:44.210515

The state-owned power company will start charging a special rate to ensure energy-intensive data centers are paying their share of costs to build new power plants. (File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette).South Carolina’s state-owned power company will start charging a special electricity rate executives say is meant to ensure energy-intensive data centers, built to serve the country’s ever-growing technology needs, are covering the cost of generating the massive amount of power they require.
The goal is to ensure existing customers don’t end up footing the bill for new, power-hungry companies.
The governing board of Santee Cooper voted unanimously Friday to implement the new rate for large, incoming customers on an “experimental” four-year basis, testing it out before considering whether they want to make the policy permanent.
In a presentation to the board, Mike Smith, director of billing and pricing for the Moncks Corner-based utility, said he anticipates large customers coming into Santee Cooper territory could need as much as 1,000 megawatts of power as soon as 2030.
“That’s significant growth for a system the size of ours,” he said.
That growth rate mirrors the demand utilities are seeing across the Southeast, he said.
“We expect that to continue,” Smith said. “We don’t think it’s going to abate anytime soon.”
The new rate goes beyond data centers.
It applies to any customer requiring 50 megawatts of power or more, which would sweep in some of the electric vehicle and battery manufacturers under construction in the state. Those companies have reported energy needs between 100 and 150 megawatts, according to economic development officials.
Still, it’s data centers that have dominated the conversation around energy in South Carolina. These windowless buildings house rows of servers necessary for everything from artificial intelligence to high-speed financial trades. The largest of these centers can use as much as 200 megawatts each.
“We do welcome large loads because they’re good loads for the system. However, because of their size and operating characteristics, they’re difficult for Santee Cooper to absorb,” Smith said.
Santee Cooper’s new experimental rate comes as South Carolina grapples with how to meet the energy needs of a growing population, manufacturing base and, of course, an influx of data centers being built by tech giants such as Google, Meta and Blox.
A provision on the issue was inserted in legislation under consideration by the General Assembly.
Senate passes sweeping energy bill aimed at meeting SC’s growing power needs

In a late-night debate about two weeks ago, the Senate voted to limit tax and power-related incentives the state allows for data centers. Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey pushed for the change saying that as data centers come to South Carolina, he wants them to pay an equivalent share of the costs for power plants built to serve them.
In the weeks since the Senate vote, which amended a bill previously passed by the House with almost no opposition, data center developers have pushed back, said Geoff Penland, Santee Cooper’s director of government relations.
He said technology companies are worried about the loss of sales tax breaks they’ve historically received on both computer equipment and electricity.
Penland said it appears the House and Senate may reach a compromise on the matter with just two weeks left in the legislative session.
While Santee Cooper is largely unconcerned with incentives for data centers, the energy legislation is of the utmost importance to the utility as it seeks permission to partner with private utility company Dominion Energy on a possible 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant on the site of a former coal-fired power plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
And the board’s vote Friday means these new power rates will go into effect no matter what legislators ultimately decide on data centers.
Meeting a growing energy demand requires construction of expensive power plants, power transmission lines, as well as the purchase of extra power that Santee Cooper has to buy from other utility companies on occasion when it doesn’t have enough energy of its own.
Building and buying those things mean increased rates for all customers, even if those other customers aren’t the ones driving the need for those investments, Smith said. That’s what Santee Cooper is trying to curtail.
Smith pointed to a similar effort by Georgia Power Company, which asked utility regulators to develop special contractual terms for large users.
Under Santee Cooper’s new rate, large users must sign a 15-year contract, one they can’t get out of without paying a set minimum. The utility also will charge more for power used at times of day when demand for energy is at its highest.
Santee Cooper worries about the possibility that these large users, particularly data centers, could come on the grid and then leave before the utility is able to get back the money it spent to serve them, Smith said. The long-term contract aims to prevent that.
Finally, the new deals require large users to ramp up to their full contracted power usage within three years.
“It also protects us from somebody who comes in, oversells, and says they’re going to come in at 300 megawatts and ends up at 127 (megawatts),” Smith gave as an example.
“Regardless of how many kilowatt hours this customer uses, if they come on the system, they’ll be accountable,” he added.
While the board ultimately all voted in favor of the change, two members who represent South Carolina’s power cooperatives, which get their power from Santee Cooper, raised concerns that no large customer would agree to these new terms.
They said Santee Cooper and rural electric cooperatives will lose potential new business.
They also worried about the speed with which the change was made. Santee Cooper staff will typically take 18 months to vet and implement a new, permanent rate. This change was studied over just a few months.
In an effort to allay concerns, staff told the board because of the rate’s “experimental” status, it could make changes at any point in the four-year trial period.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC_0320-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

Kim Reynolds testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Feb. 5, 2025 about government efficiency efforts in Iowa. (Photo courtesy of CSPAN)Gov. Kim Reynolds has filed a lawsuit against the Des Moines Register that seeks to keep confidential some of the written communications among her senior advisors.
In court papers filed Friday by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, Reynolds asks for an injunction to stop the Register “from demanding production of the documents protected by executive privilege.”
The lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court, argues that the Register “contends that the governor may not communicate with, or privately correspond with, her most senior advisors without those communications being open public records. That is not — and cannot be — the law.” The lawsuit claims that such a requirement for disclosure would preclude her from receiving “candid advice from her closest advisors.”
However, the Register argues that the documents being withheld by Reynolds were not authored by, or sent to, Reynolds, and are instead part of an exchange among her advisors and staff.
The documents in question are tied to Reynold’s Feb. 5 testimony before the U.S. House Oversight Committee, which was conducting hearings on government efficiency. At the time, Reynolds was questioned by U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, as to whether she agreed with Michael Flynn, a former advisor to President Donald Trump, that Lutheran Family Services was connected to a “money-laundering operation.”
During the hearing, Reynolds answered by saying, “I can tell you that in Iowa, the taxpayers of Iowa hold me personally responsible and accountable for state government, just as they hold President Trump accountable,” and when pressed on whether she agreed with Flynn, she said “I can’t speak to that.”
Days later, Reynolds said she “absolutely” did not agree with Flynn’s assessment and praised the organization for its charitable works.
The Register then sought access to emails to and from several of Reynolds’ advisers that referenced Lutheran Family Services. Reynolds’ office says it turned over more than 800 pages of documents, while withholding four documents that it said contained “candid, private advice and counsel from her most senior advisors.”
According to the Register, the four withheld emails are each labeled with the subject line “Media Prep Doc,” and Reynolds herself was not copied on those emails.
In the newly filed lawsuit, Reynolds’ office argues the Register’s view is that “executive privilege cannot include documents sent between senior staff intended for the governor. Instead, presumably, the governor must be CC’d or otherwise included on an email or other communication directly to assert privilege.”
Mason Mauro, Reynolds’ spokesperson, said Friday in a written statement that “it is in the public’s interest that governors can receive candid advice from their closest advisors. We are confident that the judicial branch will recognize that governors have a constitutional executive privilege in Iowa, just as they recognized a legislative privilege last year, and have used a deliberative privilege to protect the communications of Iowa Supreme Court justices.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Reynolds.CSPAN_.2.5-e1738792607674-1024x638.png,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

Naig was a guest Friday on the Iowa PBS show “Iowa Press,” where he also discussed the challenges facing Iowa’s agricultural economy, bird flu and eminent domain.
Naig, a Republican and native Iowan, has been ag secretary since 2018 and was reelected in 2022.
No official bid for governor
Naig said the announcement from Gov. Kim Reynolds that she would not be seeking reelection came as “a bit of a surprise” that has caused him to pause and consider the possibility of running for the position. 
“I still, at this stage of my life, I want to be of service to the state of Iowa, and I want to think about the best ways that I can do that,” Naig said. 
Naig said at this time the discussion is on his “side of the table” with family, friends and supporters to decide if a run for governor is the best path forward.

When pressed for more details, like staff and campaign strategies in the event of gubernatorial bid, Naig said he’s not to that point. 
“This is around my kitchen table, this is about me getting into a planter tractor here in the next couple weeks and giving a lot of thought to it,” Naig said. “That’s not to say we’re not talking to a lot of folks.” 
Naig said Republicans in Iowa have a deep bench of potential candidates. Attorney General Brenna Bird, Sen. Mike Bousselot, House Speaker Pat Grassley, and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann have said they are considering the gig. 
Changes impacting ag in Iowa 
Naig said the agricultural economy in Iowa is “tough” and while there were positive trade outcomes from the first Trump administration’s foreign policy, Iowa farmers are in a worse position now to weather potential trade wars. 
“We don’t have the kind of buffer in our ag economy — profitability and margins are not where they were even then, today,” Naig said. “There’s not a lot of room to absorb that shock.” 
Naig said this was a message sent to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins during her recent visit to Iowa, and that the ag department should be ready to support farmers. 
Naig said he is “encouraged” by the countries that are coming to the table to negotiate better trade deals, and hopes to see greater domestic consumption of ag commodities by expanding the ethanol industry and branching into sustainable aviation fuel. 
“What you hope and certainly what we’re advocating for is unleashing that domestic consumption, but needing to make sure that we’ve got an expanded trade portfolio as well,” Naig said. 
Naig said India could be a potential “game changer” if the country were able to make a trade agreement with the country.

The nation is in its fourth year of an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has impacted more than 168 million birds nationally. 
Naig said he is considering options, like a vaccine for birds, now that he was not willing to consider three years ago. He also said there needs to be more people in the animal industries sector of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to respond to outbreaks like HPAI.
The Iowa secretary said he did not believe a “herd immunity” approach, which has been suggested by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was “a workable solution” to the bird flu.
Other issues 
Naig has been pushing for the Legislature to expand the Choose Iowa program, which helps to market and support Iowa grown products and producers. 
One of its programs is similar to the recently cut federal Local Food for School and Local Food Purchase Assistance programs, which were COVID-era funds to help schools and local institutions purchase from local farmers. 
Naig said he hopes the Choose Iowa versions, which this year were just pilot programs, could be a permanent program, funded through regular appropriations rather than short-term funding pools. 
“We want something that can actually stand the test of time, be around, be something that you can plan for,” Naig said. 
Naig also addressed the issue of eminent domain, which has been a growing topic of debate across the state, particularly in relation to a carbon sequestration pipeline that has planned more than 1,000 miles of pipeline in the state. 
“It should be rare,” Naig said. “It should be the least desirable option to get something done, and there should be overwhelming voluntary agreements in place before something like a project — any project with eminent domain — would go forward.”

A Louisiana judge this week set aside the first-degree murder conviction and death sentence of Jimmie Chris Duncan, whose 1998 conviction for killing his girlfriend’s 23-month-old daughter was based in part on bite mark evidence that experts now say is junk science.
The decision comes after a Verite News and ProPublica investigation in March examined the questions surrounding Duncan’s conviction as Gov. Jeff Landry, a staunch death penalty advocate, made moves to expedite executions after a 15-year pause.
Judge Alvin Sharp, of the 4th Judicial District in Ouachita Parish, pointed to new testimony during a September appeals hearing that such bite mark analysis presented by a once-heralded forensics team is “no longer valid” and “not scientifically defensible.”
The original analysis came from forensic dentist Michael West and pathologist Dr. Steven Hayne, whose longtime partnership as state experts fell under legal scrutiny after questions emerged about the validity of their techniques.

Over the past 27 years, nine prisoners have been set free after being convicted in part on inaccurate evidence given by West and Hayne. Three of those men were on death row.
Duncan was the last person awaiting an execution based on the pair’s work, which Sharp said in his ruling appeared “questionable at best.”
Other expert witnesses said that Hayne’s autopsy and his findings were “sloppy in practice” and “inadequate overall.”
“It is worth noting that the qualifications of Dr. Hayne were lacking in certain ways to an extent that called into serious question” the pathologist’s “expert designation,” Sharp wrote in his ruling.
Sharp also stated in his ruling that he found “very compelling” the September testimony of an expert medical witness who said that the child’s death was not the result of a homicide but of an accidental drowning.
It remains unclear when — or if — Duncan will walk free.
Robert S. Tew, district attorney for the 4th Judicial District, can choose to appeal the decision, retry Duncan on the murder charge or a lesser offense or accept the court’s ruling and set him free. Tew did not respond to requests for comment. Duncan’s legal team declined to comment.
Louisiana has a long record of convicting and sentencing to death people later found to be innocent. In the past three decades, the state has exonerated 11 people facing execution, among the highest such numbers in the country, according to The National Registry of Exonerations.
Duncan, 56, has maintained his innocence for more than three decades, while prosecutors continued to insist that Duncan committed the murder and should be executed without delay.
Duncan was babysitting Haley Oliveaux, his girlfriend’s daughter, at the house they shared in West Monroe, on Dec. 18, 1993. He said he had left her alone in the bathtub while he washed dishes. At some point, he said he heard a loud noise from the bathroom. When he went to check on Haley, he found her floating face down in the water. She was pronounced dead a few hours later.
While Duncan claimed it was a tragic accident, authorities charged him with first-degree murder after Hayne and West examined the girl’s body and determined there was evidence she was sexually assaulted and intentionally drowned. After about two weeks of testimony in 1998, the jury found Duncan guilty and sentenced him to death.
Years later, Duncan’s post-conviction attorneys uncovered evidence that was not presented at trial that, they said, proves his innocence. This includes a jailhouse informant who wrote to prosecutors offering to share Duncan’s confession to the crime in what the defense claims was an exchange for leniency (the informant later recanted his trial testimony); past head injuries Haley suffered that might explain her death; and a video in which West can be seen grinding a cast of Duncan’s teeth into Haley’s body. West later claimed those bite marks, which the defense says the forensic dentist manufactured, were a match for Duncan’s teeth.
Hayne died in 2020. West did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling.
West has previously said he was simply using what he called a “direct comparison” technique, in which he presses a mold of a person’s teeth directly onto the location of suspected bite marks because it provides the most accurate results, according to a 2020 interview with Oxygen.com.
West said he no longer believed in bite mark analysis in a 2011 deposition in a different post-conviction appeal, saying, “I don’t believe it’s a system that’s reliable enough to be used in court” and admitted to making mistakes in previous cases. But he told The New Republic in a 2023 interview that his methods are valid because other people have used them.
In this week’s ruling, Sharp also noted the September testimony of Detective Chris Sasser, who investigated Haley’s death. Sasser said there was “no blood, no signs of struggle, no cleaning rags and no cleaning agents” in the bathroom or house where the alleged crime occurred. This undermined the state’s assertion that there was “massive blood loss,” the ruling said.
In addition, Sharp found that Duncan’s trial attorney, Louis Scott, provided ineffective counsel. Sharp pointed to a witness who testified that Scott failed to “investigate or present evidence that was available at the time of the trial,” that he did not “develop a coherent theory of defense,” and that he failed to disclose a conflict of interest.
Scott’s wife told Verite News and ProPublica that he has suffered significant health problems including memory and speech impairment and declined to comment on the judge’s ruling.
Duncan is among 55 people on death row in Louisiana, though until very recently he and the others were not in imminent danger of being executed as the state hadn’t put anyone to death since 2010 due to the unavailability of execution drugs. That changed with Landry’s 2023 election.
Landry has made clear his intention to carry out these death sentences as soon as possible, having recently approved the use of nitrogen gas, a controversial method allowed in only three other states.
This cleared the way for the state’s first execution in more than 15 years, as Jessie Hoffman was put to death on March 18 using nitrogen gas.

US revokes a lawful international student’s visa at Middlebury College

The news last month of SEVIS statuses being revoked came with orders to self-deport, sending many international students scrambling. Soon after, in a Michigan court, the Department of Homeland Security stated that changes to SEVIS have no bearing on a student’s lawful status, sowing further confusion.A University of Vermont spokesperson confirmed Friday that its students have not faced any visa revocations officials are aware of. Officials from St. Michael’s College also said they were not affected by the revocation.“Out of respect for the safety and privacy of those community members, we will not be publicly sharing specific information related to our community members’ immigration or visa status,” Gretchen Galbraith, vice president of academic affairs and provost at St. Michael’s, said in an emailed statement.Across Vermont, several colleges and universities declined to comment, some in an effort to safeguard student security.The American Civil Liberties Union that brought some of the lawsuits challenging the student visa revocation celebrated the change Friday.“The power of the people is stronger than the people in power,” said Hillary Rich, senior staff attorney with the Vermont ACLU, in a statement. “ACLU affiliates brought over a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration’s unlawful termination of student visas across the country — and now the administration has reversed course.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trump administration reverses course on international student visa crackdown .",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Middlebury-College-Campus-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

Joel Rudman and Tracy Caruso in the Capitol on April 25, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)For the past month, something of a civil war has raged between Florida Republicans in Tallahassee.
Gov. Ron DeSantis has accused Florida GOP House leadership of being “at war with the voters who provided the supermajority in the first place.”
He’s criticized them for ignoring his request for a property tax cut and not doing enough on condominium legislation.
And he’s accused them of working with the “liberal media” in the now-concluded investigation into Hope Florida, the welfare assistance program led by First Lady Casey DeSantis.
As a show of support, supporters of DeSantis called for a “Rally in Tally” Friday afternoon at the Capitol in support of his “Freedom Agenda.”
There was no such rally, but there was a press conference on the Plaza Level of the Capitol featuring former Panhandle House Republican Dr. Joel Rudman and Tracy Caruso, wife of Palm Beach County GOP Rep. Mike Caruso, along with some DeSantis supporters.
‘There was a mandate when we voted DeSantis in … and there isn’t a person here who ran on the idea of dismantling any of DeSantis’ policies,” said Tracy Caruso, who has already filed to run in the House District 87 seat in 2026 now held by her husband.
“My message to everyone here is please come out and talk to your representatives,” she added. “Tell them that you stand with our great Gov. Ron DeSantis.”
Text messages sent this week to voters from Restore Our Nation (RON) PAC, a DeSantis-affiliated political committee, bore a similar message: “Florida House leaders are working with Democrats to stop our agenda and sabotage Florida’s success. … Call your State Rep … and tell them to stand with the people and me to keep Florida free!”
  Text messages like this were sent to Floridians this week from Restore Our Nation (RON) PAC.
Rudman stepped down from his seat representing parts of Okaloosa and Santa Rosa counties late last year to run for the congressional seat vacated by Matt Gaetz, but lost in the GOP primary to former CFO Jimmy Patronis.
He said on Friday that he was “appalled at what was being taught” at a learning session for House members last November.
“We weren’t being taught open carry. We weren’t being taught red flag laws. We weren’t being taught immigration,” he said. “Instead, the topics of discussion that afternoon from the top down were, ‘We are not listening to Ron DeSantis anymore.'”
Rudman has made these charges repeatedly in recent weeks, including during a press conference hosted by DeSantis last week.
“Looking back, once the session started, I had no idea what we were facing even here today,” Rudman said. 
“I had no idea that we would see what I would call treachery. Basically, we have the most popular conservative governor in America. Other people in other states stop me and they tell me, ‘I wish I was from Florida. What can we do to get your conservative leadership in Georgia? In South Carolina? In Mississippi? So, to have this open revolt was even more that I couldn’t dare imagine.”
“We cannot have representatives who go against our governor when he’s the one who makes the decision on these things,” added Larry Downs from Pensacola. “I don’t want the fighting amongst our governor and our legislators. I don’t like that. I want them to lead.”
 Perez responds
Perez fired back in a statement sent to Fox News on Friday.
“While the Florida House remains the most conservative body in the Legislature — passing a budget billions lower than the Governor’s, approving larger tax cuts than the Governor, and pushing bold conservative policies like repealing gun laws and passing E-Verify — the Governor seems uninterested in a conservative Legislature,” he said.
“He wants a compliant one. After seven years in office, it’s clear he doesn’t want people asking hard questions, especially after neglecting his duties while running for president.”
Rep. Caruso was also slated to speak at the event, but with the House in session, he was unable to attend.

Trump and (Attorney General Pam) Bondi can't just decide to arrest sitting judges at will and threaten judges into submission,” wrote Schumer, a New York Democrat.Trump administration officials, including Bondi, defended the arrest as legitimate. The FBI had been investigating Dugan after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers sought to detain an immigrant without legal authority to be in the country who was in her courtroom on a misdemeanor charge.Bondi wrote on social media just after noon Eastern, “I can confirm that our @FBI agents just arrested Hannah Dugan — a county judge in Milwaukee — for allegedly helping an illegal alien avoid an arrest by @ICEgov. No one is above the law.”Democrats objectDemocrats in Washington who sounded their objections to the arrest Friday argued it subverted separation of powers.Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, said Trump “continues to test the limits of our Constitution — this time by arresting a sitting judge for allegedly obstructing an immigration operation at the courthouse.”In a statement, Durbin added that local courtrooms should be off limits to immigration enforcement agents.“When immigration enforcement officials interfere with our criminal justice system, it undermines public safety, prevents victims and witnesses from coming forward, and often prevents those who committed crimes from facing justice in the United States,” Durbin wrote.Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who represents Wisconsin, issued a statement shortly after news of the arrest, calling it “a gravely serious and drastic move.”“In the United States we have a system of checks and balances and separation of powers for damn good reasons,” Baldwin said.“The Trump Administration just arrested a sitting judge,” Arizona’s Ruben Gallego said in a social media post. “This is what happens in authoritarian countries. Stand up now — or lose the power to do so later. The administration must drop all charges and respect separation of powers.”Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, was more careful in his criticism but said Trump is “constantly challenging” separation of powers laid out in the Constitution.“I don’t know what happened in Wisconsin, but amplifying this arrest as the Attorney General and FBI Director have done looks like part of a larger intimidation campaign against judges,” the Rhode Island Democrat said in a statement.In a since-deleted post on Bluesky, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey accused Trump of “using immigrants to justify an all-out assault on our democracy and rule of law.“After openly defying a Supreme Court order, calling for judges to be impeached, and bullying and belittling judges, today his FBI director took the extreme step of ordering a sitting judge arrested,” Booker wrote, referring to the high court’s order that the Trump administration “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is being held in El Salvador.Spokespeople for Booker did not respond to a late Friday inquiry about why the post was taken down.Trump officials back up arrestAdministration officials boasted online following the arrest.FBI Director Kash Patel deleted a post on X in which he wrote Dugan  “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery.Trump posted a screenshot on his social media site from the conservative activist account “Libs of TikTok” that featured a photo of Dugan and celebrated her arrest.White House Border Czar Tom Homan said that Dugan crossed a line in her opposition to the administration’s agenda.“People can choose to support illegal immigration and not assist ICE in removing criminal illegal aliens from our communities, BUT DON’T CROSS THAT LINE,” he wrote on X. “If you actively impede our enforcement efforts or if you knowingly harbor or conceal illegal aliens from ICE you will be prosecuted. These actions are felonies. More to come…”Trump vs. courtsTrump and administration officials have publicly attacked judges online, including calling for the impeachment of District Judge James Boasberg for the District of Columbia after he ordered immigration officials to halt deportation flights to El Salvador.The administration allowed the flights to reach Central America, and is now at risk of being held in criminal contempt of court as a legal fight plays out.The president’s verbal attacks on Boasberg prompted a rare rebuke from U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in mid-March.And the administration has seemingly refused to do anything to facilitate the return of Maryland resident Abrego Garcia from a notorious El Salvador mega-prison, despite a Supreme Court order.",,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 21:28:37+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT, 18 states sue Trump administration over K-12 DEI guidance and threats to funding",Associated Press and CT Mirror Staff,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/ct-trump-administration-k-12-dei-lawsuit/,Attorney General William Tong joined a coalition of state AGs challenging the Education Department's interpretation of civil rights laws.,"Nineteen states that refused to comply with a Trump administration directive aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools went a step further Friday, filing a federal lawsuit challenging what they consider an illegal threat to cut federal funding. 
The lawsuit filed in Massachusetts by Democratic attorneys general seeks to block the Department of Education from withholding money based on its April 3 directive ordering states to certify their compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls “illegal DEI practices.” States also were told to gather signatures from local school systems certifying their compliance by April 24. 
Instead, the plaintiffs — including Connecticut — informed the government that they stand by their prior certifications of compliance with the law but refuse to abandon policies that promote equal access to education. 
“There is just no question that Connecticut schools have and will continue to comply with federal civil rights laws,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement Friday. “From the start, this has been about [President Donald] Trump and Linda McMahon trying to force their MAGA ideology on Connecticut students and teachers by unlawfully withholding our taxpayer dollars. 
“This is illegal and deeply destructive, and we’re not going to let Trump and McMahon rob from our schools and imperil our children’s futures,” Tong said.
The new lawsuit comes a day after judges in three states ruled against the Trump administration in separate but related cases. 
A Maryland judge postponed the effective date of a Feb. 14 memo in which the education department told schools and colleges they needed to end any practice that differentiates people based on their race. A judge in Washington, D.C., granted a preliminary injunction against the April certification letter. And in New Hampshire, a judge ruled that the department can not enforce either document against the plaintiffs in that case, which includes one of the nation’s largest teachers’ unions. 
All three lawsuits argue that the guidance limits academic freedom and is so vague that it leaves schools and educators in limbo about what they may do, such as whether voluntary student groups for minority students are still allowed. 
The new lawsuit accuses the administration of imperiling more than $13.8 billion, including money used to serve students with disabilities. 
“Plaintiffs are left with an impossible choice: either certify compliance with an ambiguous and unconstitutional federal directive — threatening to chill polices, programs and speech – or risk losing indispensable funds that serve their most vulnerable student populations,” the lawsuit states. 
In addition to Campbell, the plaintiffs are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. 
The education department did not respond to a request for comment Friday. President Donald Trump’s education secretary, Linda McMahon, has warned of potential funding cuts if states do not return the certification forms. 
In a Tuesday interview on the Fox Business Network, McMahon said that states that refuse to sign could “risk some defunding in their districts.” The purpose of the form is “to make sure there’s no discrimination that’s happening in any of the schools,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TongTruck-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

Swanson has been on paid administrative leave since October 2024. Photo by Jennifer Hauck/Valley NewsThis story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on April 25.WOODSTOCK — Police Chief Joe Swanson has be demoted to patrol officer after a ruling by the Woodstock Village Trustees. The five trustees issued a decision this week that sided with Municipal Manager Eric Duffy, who proposed the demotion last fall, according to Swanson’s attorney, Linda Fraas, of Manchester, N.H.On Thursday morning, Swanson reported to work at the department as a patrol officer, the same entry-level position he held nearly 20 years ago, Fraas said.“There’s no obligation for him to return to work as a patrol officer, but he’s the kind of guy that knows they are short of police officers and he’s not going to hold it against the public for what (the Trustees) have done to him. So he showed up,” she said.The decision by the trustees appears to set the stage for a protracted legal battle. Swanson’s fight to be reinstated as police chief — or to seek redress for damages over what he claims is a breach of his employment contract — would now move to the courthouse.“We’ll be filing a lawsuit in Windsor Superior Court next week,” Fraas said on Thursday, confirming news first reported in the Vermont Standard this week.The decision by the trustees came out of a marathon 14-hour public hearing last month where several police department employees aired grievances over Swanson’s leadership. Trustees have maintained they would not disclose their decision to the public, asserting that Swanson’s demotion was a “personnel matter.” (It was Swanson who insisted that last month’s hearing be open to the public, otherwise the trustees would have held it behind closed doors.)Swanson, 45, was promoted to chief by Duffy in 2023 after decades with the Woodstock department. He was placed on paid administrative leave last fall following a traffic incident during which his husband, who was driving, got into a verbal altercation with another driver.Swanson was absolved of any wrongdoing in the traffic incident by two separate investigations. But the inquiries brought to the surface simmering tensions within Woodstock’s police department. The department is currently being run by Sgt. Chris O’Keefe, who was the department’s No. 2 ranked employee under Swanson and is now interim chief.Neither trustees nor Duffy responded to a Valley News request for comment this week.Fraas said she is waiting to consult with Swanson before releasing the trustees’ 47-page decision to the public. Fraas said the ruling was “really hard to grasp because it’s filled with so many insults and attacks on (Swanson’s) character, so many characterizations that are gratuitous, mean-spirited and hateful.”Fraas contended that it is unlawful for the town to demote Swanson because there is nothing in his contract that allows it.“They’re making up some statutory authority that doesn’t exist,” she said.Any claim of “just cause is equally ludicrous based on the evidence” that was contained in an investigator’s report of Swanson’s leadership and the testimony of several department employees in a public hearing last month, she said. Fraas ticked off a list of causes of action that she said would be included in Swanson’s lawsuit against the town, including “breach of contract, wrongful termination, intentional infliction of emotional distress and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.”In addition to the lawsuit, Fraas said she expects to appeal the trustees’ decision to superior court for review, which is allowed under state municipal law. Fraas said it is possible that at some point she may seek to have Swanson’s lawsuit against the town moved to another venue. She cited potential conflicts could that arise from among the various parties, ranging from their prior business before the court, the close contact between town officials and local residents and the wide media coverage of Swanson’s situation.Swanson grew up in Woodstock and has previously served on the Selectboard. The town’s police, emergency and fire building is named after his father, the late Phil Swanson, who was the longtime town manager. The current morass began in October when Swanson was a passenger in a vehicle driven by his husband, Nicholas Seldon, a Woodstock attorney. Seldon got into a heated encounter with the driver of other vehicle.The other driver filed a “citizen’s complaint” against Seldon and Swanson, which led Duffy to place Swanson on administrative leave while Vermont State Police investigated the incident. The investigation absolved Swanson of any criminal wrongdoing. At the same time, a parallel investigation by the Vermont Criminal Justice Council cleared Swanson of any professional misconduct.During the investigations, Duffy — who had promoted Swanson to chief only 15 months earlier — began getting reports from police department personnel about Swanson’s job performance. The complaints centered on poor communication, irregular work hours, poor recordkeeping, a messy office, uncomfortable interactions with staff and a habit of showing up out of uniform.The complaints led Duffy to hire an outside investigator, who delivered a report of his findings detailing Swanson’s supposed shortcomings. Around the same time, the police union and dispatchers union — each of which has a handful of members — issued “no confidence” votes of Swanson and called upon Duffy to hire a new chief.Duffy, testifying at the Trustees’ hearing last month, said the subsequent knowledge led him to change his mind about Swanson’s management skills. Duffy believed nonetheless that Swanson was a capable patrol officer and concluded that bumping him down to the bottom rung on the ladder in the department was the appropriate response.In the “quasi-judicial” hearing where the five trustees sat as “jurors” in a trial-like setting run by a “hearing officer” who was hired by the village, Swanson finally took the stand after midnight, some 14 hours into the proceeding.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)A Republican state lawmaker in Washington won’t be allowed back in the House chamber this session following his latest outburst during a legislative debate.
Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah, will be participating remotely in the last three days after his latest verbal disruption proved to be “the last straw” for House leaders.
“What I did was a breach of decorum. I accept the consequences of my action,” Dufault said in a statement Friday. “But I will also continue to fight for my constituents and stand up to the tyranny of the majority when needed.”
Dufault, who represents the 15th Legislative District in central Washington, has been rebuked several times in the course of the 105-day session for making comments in floor debates that run afoul of House decorum.
On Thursday, at the outset of debate on a highly controversial bill concerning the rights of public school students and their parents, Democrats denied a Republican lawmaker’s motion to reject the version passed by the Senate for not comporting with House rules.
When the presiding speaker, Rep. Tarra Simmons, D-Bremerton, issued the ruling, Dufault leapt up and angrily shouted his disagreement.
“It was the last straw. It was more intense,” House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle said Friday. “A lot of members were anxious about his mental state and whether that could be a physical threat.”
Lawmakers in both parties said privately that at that moment, they feared Dufault might be armed and something worse might occur. Dufault said in an interview Thursday, he has a permit to carry a concealed weapon but had no weapons on the floor.
Following the episode, floor proceedings in the House paused for about two to three hours, and Washington State Patrol officers increased their presence in the chamber.
In the House, the Speaker can remove any person creating a disturbance or engaging in disorderly conduct in the chamber. Fitzgibbon said barring Dufault for the rest of the session was a mutual decision with leaders of the House Republican caucus.
Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn, declined requests for comment Thursday. On Friday, a spokesperson sent an email saying Stokesbary “is not going to comment on internal caucus discussions.”
Dufault said Thursday night he learned of the ban in a text from his caucus leader. He said he was working virtually from an office in the legislative building.
“I will always speak passionately. I will always speak directly,” he said. “I believe that my tone is appropriate and measured.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1014-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.

The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
Gov. Tony Evers said the arrest was another example of the Trump administration’s attacks on the judiciary.
“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump Administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor,” he said. “I have deep respect for the rule of law, our nation’s judiciary, the importance of judges making decisions impartially without fear or favor, and the efforts of law enforcement to hold people accountable if they commit a crime. I will continue to put my faith in our justice system as this situation plays out in the court of law.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights. In recent weeks, the administration has attacked the integrity of our judicial system, refused to comply with a Supreme Court order, and arrested a judge for using her authority to protect the fair administration of justice.”
This is a developing story and will be updated.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Three weeks ago, the taps rumbled to life in Thomas Chee’s home. For the first time in his life, water sputtered through his faucet. 
“Oh, it was so beautiful,” said 47-year-old Chee on Friday. “Boy, it just hit me. It hit hard, and I just broke down.” 
Chee is one of the few dozen residents of Westwater, Utah, a small Navajo community in the southwest corner of the state that for years lacked water and electricity. Chee, who currently serves as the community president, has called Westwater home for his entire life. 
He, along with his neighbors, have used outhouses, hauled water with tanks on the back of their trucks, relied on solar electricity and lit kerosene lamps. With his grandmother, Chee would often walk down to a spring in a ravine near his home to get drinking water.

Until now.
For 25 years, residents have been trying to get water. In March, Chee said, “our prayers were answered.” 
On Friday, Westwater residents celebrated alongside Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, Utah GOP Rep. Mike Kennedy and other lawmakers, bureaucrats and tribal leaders. 
“As president, my priority has always been water, water, water,” said Nygren, who took office in 2023. “I grew up without running water. I know what it’s like to haul water. I know what it takes, it’s tough, it’s something that our kids and our relatives shouldn’t be going through.”
Bringing water to Westwater was part of a larger, ongoing effort to expand access to water in Navajo communities. Estimates vary, but somewhere between 30% to 40% of homes on the Navajo Nation, the country’s largest Indian reservation, lack running water. That’s despite Lake Powell and the Colorado River, which supplies drinking water to 40 million people across seven states and Mexico, running along the northern border of the reservation. 
But those communities are mostly rural, tucked away in some of the most remote parts of the lower 48 states. Westwater is not. 
The same ravine where Chee and his family got their drinking water separates Westwater and Blanding, home to about 3,100 people. In minutes, a Westwater resident can get to Blanding’s main street, which has a hospital, a grocery store, a city hall, bank, and a handful of cafes, shops and restaurants. Utah State University’s campus in Blanding is visible from Westwater.  
“I was shocked with how close this community was to Blanding,” Henderson told Utah News Dispatch Friday, describing her first visit to Westwater. “This is a community right here, next to a city. So to me, this challenge was something that I felt was worth taking on.”

Expanding basic utilities to Westwater was less of a logistical issue — which is often the case for the remote communities that dot the Navajo Nation — and more of a jurisdictional issue. 
The land has long been home to Navajo families, and was purchased by the Navajo Nation in 1986. However, it’s “fee simple” land, not reservation land, meaning the residents pay taxes to San Juan County. That’s different from untaxed “trust” land, which makes up most American reservations and is under full control of indigenous people. 
For 25 years, as Westwater residents lobbied for access to water, they were stuck in jurisdictional limbo, caught between the Navajo Nation, the city, county, and state. 
“No one really took ownership, no one took responsibility for the people out here. It wasn’t really the tribe’s responsibility, it wasn’t the county, or the city’s responsibility. So I decided it was the state’s responsibility,” Henderson said. 
Henderson, who gave Westwater a shoutout during her inaugural address earlier this year, said she made improving access to water and electricity a priority.

In 2020, the Utah Legislature appropriated $500,000 to electrify Westwater, matched by a $500,000 donation from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Two years later, Westwater tied into Blanding’s grid and lights flickered on in the 29 lots that make up the small community. That same year, Blanding struck a deal with the state of Utah, the Navajo Nation, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority and San Juan County to bring culinary water to Westwater. 
The Navajo Nation chipped in $5.5 million, and Utah state leaders allocated $3.5 million in American Rescue Plan funds, the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden in 2021. Blanding city leaders changed its ordinances to allow for a well to be drilled, and a coalition of nonprofits, with help from the county, helped raise funds and coordinate the project.  
State officials helped Blanding build an arsenic treatment plant and drill a new well near the spring that divides the city and Westwater. For the last couple years, crews have been building a pipeline into the community. 
By late March, every Westwater resident had potable water flowing through their taps.  
“This project is a testament to what can happen when people come together,” said Logan Monson, the former mayor of Blanding who now serves as a Republican lawmaker in the Utah House. “It is my hope today that this water project will stand as a symbol, a symbol that every person matters. That every community deserves to be seen.” 
Now that the residents have water and electricity, leaders have high hopes for the small city.

“Moving forward, the Westwater community is not going to have those struggles, so that they can focus on some of the things that matter. What else can life provide you when you set yourself up,” Nygren said. 
Chee, standing in the creek where he once helped his grandmother bring water back to their home, echoed the Navajo Nation president. 
“I believe we will thrive. Life has gotten easier,” he said. “We don’t have to worry about hauling, or looking for water. I believe my community will be more productive.” 
Chee spoke over the soft trickle of the spring, pausing as his eyes watered. 
“For many years, we relied on this beautiful water right here. It sustained life. Sorry to be emotional, but water is a real precious resource,” he said. “It’s been a long time coming for my people to have this infrastructure.”

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho Supreme Court on Friday heard arguments in a lawsuit that alleges state officials drafted biased and misleading information for voters on an abortion rights ballot initiative. 
Idahoans United for Women and Families, the group behind the ballot initiative, in January sued, alleging ballot titles and financial analysis — developed by state officials for voters to see — are inaccurate. 
“Idahoans need clear and concise information about a proposed ballot initiative’s fiscal impact and its purpose to decide whether to say yes or no at the ballot box — based on their understanding, and not on confusion,” said Anne Henderson Haws, an attorney with the law firm Holland & Hart, which is representing the abortion ballot initiative group. “The fiscal impact statement and the ballot titles prepared for the Reproductive Freedom and Privacy Act fail to meet these standards.”
As Idaho Legislature winds down, Republican lawmakers maintain strict abortion bans

State agencies defend the descriptions — which use “fetus viability” in one reference, and say the initiative will marginally raise state expenses. The agencies, which wrote the ballot titles and fiscal analysis, say they comply with state law.
“To the extent there’s a gap here, I think the gap between their definition and the term fetal variability is worlds larger than the gap between the term fetal viability and fetus viability,” said Idaho Solicitor General Alan Hurst, who works for the Idaho Attorney General’s Office. “And if the two terms are not synonymous — like if fetus favors us slightly, and fetal favors them slightly, which we don’t concede — then why is it that the one that’s in favor wins out, when the statutory standard is you’re not supposed to be either in favor or against?” 
The ballot initiative proposes abortion exemptions to Idaho’s strict abortion ban laws for emergencies, fetal viability and other reproductive health protections.
The court will issue a decision at a later date.
In 2023, the Idaho Supreme Court ordered the Idaho Attorney General’s Office to rewrite ballot titles for an unsuccessful election reform ballot initiative, following a lawsuit.

 Justices grilled AG attorney on using ‘fetus viability’ in ballot title

The ballot titles, developed by the Idaho Office of the Attorney General, are brief descriptions of the initiative.
The short title doesn’t say that the law would allow emergency abortions after viability, Idahoans United spokesperson Melanie Folwell previously told States Newsroom.
And the short title uses the term “fetus viability,” which is not the medical phrase, the initiative group argues. That conflicts with the long title’s use of the term “fetal viability,” the group argues. 
Justices repeatedly asked Idaho’s solicitor general why the attorney general’s office used a different term than the initiative’s policy.
Hurst said the AG’s office believes fetal viability and fetus viability are essentially the same term.

At one point, Justice Robyn Brody questioned whether the language was meant to evoke the broader abortion debate. 
Anti-abortion activists often call fetuses unborn children. But abortion-rights activists often frame abortion in terms of medical freedom for pregnant patients.
Hurst then referenced news writing standards by the Associated Press, a prominent international news wire outlet, that advise against using the terms “pro life” and “pro choice” in news articles. 
“There are no neutral options here. To the extent the neutral options are here, its fetus viability — fetal viability,” Hurst replied. “That’s more favorable to their side than to ours. The AG has not used pro life language in this. He has done his utmost to use language that is consistent with the way the initiative frames things.”
Justice Cynthia Meyer soon pointed out that the Attorney General’s Office’s long title uses the term “life of the unborn child.”
 Fiscal impact statement says initiative will marginally raise state costs. That’s also in dispute. 

The bigger issue is with the fiscal impact statement, Folwell previously told States Newsroom. 
The fiscal impact statement says the initiative wouldn’t affect taxes or the state’s general fund, but it says the initiative could minorly affect state expenses — in Medicaid and prisoner populations.

“Passage of this initiative is likely to cost less than $20,000 per year. The Medicaid budget for providing services was about $850 million in FY2024,” the fiscal impact review said. “If passed, nominal costs in the context of the affected total budget are insignificant to the state.”
Initiative organizers argue that’s not true. 
Justice Colleen Zahn pressed an attorney for Idahoans United on how the initiative wouldn’t raise costs, since Idaho pays for Medicaid patients who need care from complications from abortion pills.
“There’s no evidence that it would increase costs so as to increase any budget that doesn’t already exist,” Henderson Haws said. 
The fiscal analysis was prepared by the Idaho Division of Financial Management, an agency overseen by Idaho Gov. Brad Little. 
 What is the Idaho abortion rights ballot initiative? 

After filing four proposed policies in August, Idahoans United for Women and Families narrowed its focus down to one policy that would establish a fundamental right to contraception and fertility treatments under Idaho law.
That would include:

in vitro fertilization;
making decisions about pregnancy and childbirth; 
legalizing abortion before fetal viability; and
preserving the right to abortion after viability in medical emergencies.

Under the proposed initiative, fetal viability would be determined by a physician and what treatment is available. In the medical community, viability is generally considered to be between 23 to 24 weeks of gestational age.
Initiative organizers are collecting signatures in the hopes of qualifying the initiative to be considered by Idaho voters in the November 2026 general election.
A ballot initiative is a proposed law that Idaho voters can approve or reject — independent of the Idaho Legislature. Only the Legislature can propose constitutional amendments, unlike many other states. 
To pass, the initiative would require a simple majority support from voters.

Both the W and the Walston-Hoover Stadium, which the release stated is also used for recreational programming, are in need of renovations and updates, according to the college. The $5 million ask is tied to the community wellness and recreation initiative branch of “Our Brightest Days: The Campaign for Realizing Purpose and Leading Change,” a Wartburg fundraising campaign with an overall goal of $36 million.
Funds would go toward updating exercise and pool equipment, resurfacing indoor and outdoor tracks, replacing field turf and upgrading a climbing wall, according to the release.
“For nearly two decades, the Ohle Wartburg-Waverly Sports & Wellness Center has stood as a shining example of what can be accomplished when a college and community join forces with a shared vision,” said Sheila Kittleson, The W’s executive director, in the release.
According to the university’s campaign webpage, almost $970,000 of the $5 million goal has already been raised. Other targeted areas the university is fundraising for include scholarship funds, experiential learning opportunities, alumni and career connections and classroom technology upgrades.

Elfer estimated there about 15 to 20 roads underwater in the area. 
A truck sits in high water after the owner parked, then boated to his residence on Chickasaw Road in Vicksburg as a rising Mississippi River causes backwater flooding, Friday, April 25, 2025.
“We’re about half a foot (on the river gauge) from a major flood,” he said. “But we don’t think it’s going to be like in 2011, so we can kind of manage this.”
The National Weather projects the river to crest at 49.5 feet on Monday, making it the highest peak at the Vicksburg gauge since 2020. Elfer said some residents in north Vicksburg — including at the Ford Subdivision as well as near Chickasaw Road and Hutson Street — are having to take boats to get home, adding that those who live on the unprotected side of the levee are generally prepared for flooding.

“There are a few (inundated homes), but we’ve mitigated a lot of them,” he said. “Some of the structures have been torn down or raised. There are a few people that still live on the wet side of the levee, but they kind of know what to expect. So we’re not too concerned with that.”
The river first reached flood stage in the city — 43 feet — on April 14. State officials closed Highway 465, which connects the Eagle Lake community just north of Vicksburg to Highway 61, last Friday.

Elfer said the areas impacted are mostly residential and he didn’t believe any businesses have been affected, emphasizing that downtown Vicksburg is still safe for visitors. He said Warren County has worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency to secure pumps and barriers. 
“Everybody thus far has been very cooperative,” he said. “We continue to tell people stay out of the flood areas, don’t drive around barricades and don’t drive around road close signs. Not only is it illegal, it’s dangerous.”
NWS projects the river to stay at flood stage in Vicksburg until May 6. The river reached its record crest of 57.1 feet in 2011.

University of Kentucky President Eli Capilouto announced the reversal following the Trump administration’s Friday decision to restore student visa registrations of foreign students that faced legal challenges. 
In a message to campus issued Friday afternoon, Capilouto said the visas revoked for a small number of international graduate students earlier this month had been restored. On April 4, Capilouto announced the Department of Homeland Security notified UK that the department was revoking some F-1 student visas.
“This week, we learned that this decision has been reversed for those students and their status has been restored,” Capilouto said Friday. “University officials again immediately informed impacted students. Teams from across the university continue to monitor this important issue and any changes.” 
Capilouto said UK administration will continue to update students, faculty and staff about how federal policies will affect campus online. 
International students and graduates at other Kentucky universities — Murray State University, Campbellsville University and the University of Louisville — faced similar situations over the past couple of weeks. A spokesperson for UofL said visas for three recent international graduates have been restored Friday afternoon. Spokespeople for MSU and CU did not immediately return a request for comment Friday afternoon. 
Earlier this week, campus groups and local organizations rallied on MSU’s campus to show support for international students there after a student’s visa was revoked. 
Inside Higher Ed tracked that as of Friday, more than 1,800 international students and graduates across the country had their legal status changed by the U.S. State Department. 
Meanwhile, Capilouto addressed how changing federal policies at large under President Donald Trump are impacting higher education in a report to UK’s board during a Friday meeting. In addition to the revocation of visas for international students, universities across the country are facing pressure to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies or risk losing federal funding. 
At the state level, Kentucky public universities are weighing how to implement a recent state law that seeks to eliminate DEI in higher education. In response to that, UK and UofL canceled graduation ceremonies for students in some minority groups. Capilouto said in his report UK took “that action because we believe that’s what is required” under the law. 
To the board, Capilouto said the administration will be “seeking your guidance on how we can best” navigate this time” over the next few months. 
“How do we comply with the law — and the directives we receive — from policymakers at both the federal state and levels … while, at the same time, working every day to support the people … our students … our staff … our faculty … who make our mission possible?” Capilouto said in his report.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0798-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-25 17:08:28.111147

FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
Dugan-Crim-complaint
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power.”
Gov. Tony Evers said the arrest was another example of the Trump administration’s attacks on the judiciary.
“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor,” he said.
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights.”

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)New Mexico Health officials reported one additional New Mexico measles case Friday, this time an adult in Eddy County, bringing the total reported infections to 66.
The slow drip of cases in recent weeks does not indicate the outbreak is abating, according to New Mexico Department of Health Communications Director Robert Nott, who told Source NM that symptoms can appear a week or more after infections.
“The seemingly slow increase in measles cases in New Mexico should not be taken as a sign we are anywhere near out of the woods with this outbreak,” Nott said in a written statement. “We see continued measles spread in bordering areas — Mexico and Texas, for example — so there is always the potential for a new introduction of cases in New Mexico.”
Nott also noted that cases may rise in coming weeks after recent Easter weekend gatherings, given that “symptoms of measles do not appear until roughly a week (or more) after infection.”
The majority of measles cases in New Mexico remain in Lea County, which has 61 cases; the state has had six hospitalizations since the outbreak began in neighboring Gaines County, Texas, just across the state line. Cases in Doña Ana and Chaves counties remain unchanged, with one reported case each.
Texas health officials on Friday reported cases increased by an additional 22 infections, bringing the total there to 646.
Measles is highly contagious, spread through contact with airborne droplets from an infected person. Infected people can spread the disease several days before symptoms such as fever, red eyes, cough or spotty red rash appear. Two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine offers 97% protection against catching the measles, according to the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control.
While the majority of health professionals continue to recommend two doses of the vaccine as the safest and most effective prevention from contracting measles, a recent poll from nonpartisan health research organization KFF found nearly a quarter of their sample believed false claims about the vaccine.
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

Also this week, researchers from Stanford Medicine published findings that determined if vaccination rates drop further, measles (and other infectious diseases) could return in the U.S. after decades of eradication. Using a mathematical model to simulate the spread of diseases, researchers also found that if vaccination rates remain the same, measles may still make a comeback in the next two decades.
Pediatrician Dr. Melissa Mason told Source NM she sees a measles comeback as a matter of potential life and death.
“With vaccination rates as they stand, without dropping more, we’re still gonna see people get measles — get sick and die from this,” she said.
Mason, who chairs the immunization committee for the New Mexico Pediatric Society, said she’s been impressed with efforts from New Mexico health officials to vaccinate people in the Southeastern corner of the state. Statewide vaccination rates are nearly double from the same time frame last year, according to data released Tuesday.
“These are gold star efforts, and that’s going to make a difference,” she said. “But nationally, in other areas that continue to have lower rates than 95% coverage, we’re going to continue to see measles.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 20:56:11+00:00,CT Mirror,Effort underway to seek a pardon for former Gov. John G. Rowland,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/ct-john-rowland-trump-pardon/,A discreet effort is underway to explore the possibility of President Donald J. Trump pardoning former Gov. John G. Rowland.,"A discreet effort is underway to explore the possibility of President Donald J. Trump pardoning former Gov. John G. Rowland for his convictions in two federal criminal cases, including one that contributed to his resignation as Connecticut’s governor amid an impeachment inquiry in July 2004. 
“I am aware people are talking about it, probably because the Trump administration has made a strong commitment to doing more pardons including appointing a pardon czar, but I have not made an application for one,” Rowland said Friday in an email.
He declined further comment.
Trump began his second term on Jan. 20, 2025, with a sweeping clemency order for 1,500 people implicated in the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol, and he created a new clemency post a month later, naming Alice Williams as the White House “pardon czar.” 
“You’ve been an inspiration to people, and we’re going to be listening to your recommendation on pardons,” Trump said. 
Williams, 69, had served 21 years in prison on a nonviolent drug crime before Trump commuted her sentence in 2018 and then pardoned her in 2020 hours after she addressed the Republican National Convention. Still, the path to a pardon is not clearly mapped, as evidenced by calls on Rowland’s behalf.
Fred Camillo, the first selectman of Greenwich, said he recently was approached about whether he could recommend anyone capable of furthering the cause of a Rowland pardon. Camillo attributed the call to the perception that an elected CEO in Greenwich must have valuable contacts.
Camillo declined to identify the caller.
“We get these calls all the time,” said Camillo, a Republican elected as first selectman in 2019. He is a former state representative first elected to the House in 2008, four years after Rowland resigned as governor. “I certainly know people in the administration.”
One of Trump’s cabinet officers, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, is from Greenwich. But Camillo was uncertain as to whether he could help make a contact with McMahon.
The White House had no immediate comment.
Rowland’s friendship with the Bush family presumably would be of no help with a pardon, given Trump’s disdain of a political dynasty with roots in Greenwich, which also was Trump’s home during his first marriage.
“We need another Bush in office about as much as we need Obama to have a 3rd term,” Trump wrote in 2013. “No more Bushes!”
But the president has been sympathetic to politicians who claim their prosecutions were politically motivated. A case in point: his commutation and eventual pardon of Rod Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois.
He was convicted in 2011 on charges related to trying to sell an appointment to the U.S. Senate, a vacancy created by Barack Obama’s election as president. Blagojevich had served eight years of a 14-year sentence when Trump commuted his sentence in 2020. 
Trump, who had faced federal indictments related to the Jan. 6 effort to overturn the 2020 election and mishandling of classified documents, expressed a certain solidarity with Blagojevich in signing a pardon in February.
“I’ve watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people, some of the same people I had to deal with,” Trump said.
Rowland was elected to Congress at age 27 in 1984 and to the first of his three terms as governor in 1994.
Facing impeachment and a federal investigation into bid-rigging involving gifts and favors from state contractors, Rowland resigned July 1, 2004, and pleaded guilty to a corruption charge Dec. 23, 2004. Three months later, he was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, ultimately serving 10 months.
In speeches after his release, Rowland blamed his fall on a “sense of entitlement” and an “arrogance of power.” In one talk to students, he called his fall surreal, saying it seemed he was visiting George W. Bush in the White House one day then standing in line for toilet paper in prison the next.
He was indicted a second time in 2014, accused of soliciting congressional candidates in 2010 and 2012 to secretly pay him as a consultant in campaigns for his old 5th Congressional District seat.
Mark Greenberg rebuffed him in 2010, but Lisa Wilson-Foley agreed to secretly pay for his help in 2012, arranging for her husband’s nursing home company to disguise $35,000 in campaign expenditures to Rowland as a business expense. The government said Wilson-Foley wanted Rowland’s help without the public disclosure required by federal campaign finance laws.
At the time he was secretly working for Wilson-Foley’s campaign, he was the host of a popular evening drive-time show on WTIC-AM. He was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison.
Rowland, now 67, raised money for the Prison Fellowship after his second release. He was among the VIP mourners at the recent funeral of his former lieutenant and successor, M. Jodi Rell.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3192.jpg,,,2025-04-25 17:08:28.111147

Montpelier’s Kellogg-Hubbard Library is poised to celebrate its own flood recovery milestone one week later.
Read the story on VTDigger here:   ‘Time to do something different’: Johnson’s library to roll across town, out of the floodplain, on Saturday.","The Johnson Public Library awaits its move across town, decorated with painted boards celebrating libraries covering its windows. “Rewriting our story” reads a banner hanging from the roof. Photo courtesy of Charlotte (Lotty) Roozekrans.In the early hours of Saturday morning, the town of Johnson plans to roll their public library a half-mile through town and across the river to its new home. That’s right: The over-a-century-old brick building is going to roll.The move is designed to take the library out of the floodplain, where it has been damaged by high waters again and again since its construction in 1909. According to Library Director Jeanne Engel, the building has been hit with around 15 floods, large and small, during her 25-plus-year career. Despite previous mitigation efforts, the July 2023 flood hit the town and its library particularly hard.“We are not just jacking up and rolling the physical building down the street … we are creating a new heart of Johnson that is free from the risk of flooding,” Town Administrator Thomas Galinat wrote in a press release about the move. “This is a message for Johnson, and all of Vermont, it is time to do something different.”Johnson Town Administrator Thomas Galinat gestures as he talks about the high water that flooded the town’s public library last July. He visited the building with a reporter on June 6, 2024. File photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerThe town is employing 28 bucket trucks, 60 to 70 construction workers, around a dozen utility workers, four police cruisers, two ambulances and a fire truck to move the library to its new home, a spot right between Johnson’s Elementary School and Legion Field. The process is expected to take all night.On Friday evening, utility workers plan to turn power off and bring lines down to make a clear path for the building. At midnight, the building will begin its journey down to Route 15 and across the Pearl Street Bridge, where streetlights will have been removed: The library is wide enough to hang out over the guardrails. The downtown section of Route 15, a two-lane state highway, is set to be closed at 3 a.m. to make way for the move. Around 9 a.m. on Saturday, Galinat estimated, the library will have just about reached its new home, which was formerly an alumni house for Vermont State University, Galinat said on Thursday. After that building was taken down two decades ago, the vacant lot has been used as an overflow parking lot.Town leaders are asking the greater community to gather in celebration on Legion Field at 11:30 a.m., where the main event is in store: Elementary school children will be pulling the building into place with ropes around noon.‘Rewriting our story’Moving the 40-by-45-foot building out of the floodplain’s reach had always been a pipe dream for library staff and trustees. Following the 2023 flood, however, things were desperate enough that the pipe dream became the solution, Galinat said Thursday.“In the face of increasing weather events and all we’ve lost, we are Rewriting Our Story,” he wrote in the release. “It was the rivers that brought us together to build the mill town of Johnson, (and) it is now time to accept that it is the rivers that are putting our town at risk.”Following Saturday’s move, library trustees plan to proceed with further renovation and construction efforts, with a tentative target date of being in the building by Dec. 31.Jeanne Engel, director of the Johnson Public Library, stands in the library’s temporary location on June 6, 2024. The library’s existing building suffered heavy damage in last summer’s flooding and has yet to be fully reconstructed. File photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerThe project is funded by a $1.68 million grant from the Vermont Department of Libraries. In addition to the move and restoration work, library trustees plan to make new space for community meeting rooms, a computer lab and private areas for telehealth services. According to a community donation site, part of the library will remain open after regular hours for community events, meetings and programs.Engel, the library director, learned of the grant opportunity less than a month before it was due, she said, and a group of community volunteers put together the application in two weeks.Galinat recalled the moment when the volunteers sat down and divided up pieces of the 10-page grant application to work on — including the backstory, potential future programming, contacting engineers and the Agency of Transportation. It was “probably the most beautiful moment” in his municipal career, he said.“Really anything is truly possible in a time of need —” Galinat said.“— when you have a community,” Engel added.Even now, it’s the community that’s coordinating the move, as the renovation project does not have a general contractor and is not yet out to bid.“This is literally a community effort moving a building across town,” Galinat said.The 2023 flood devastated more than just the library, however. The town’s wastewater treatment plant filled with eight feet of water along with the post office, the first floor of the municipal office building and Johnson’s sole grocery store.The village trustees have voted to restore the sewage plant in its current location, Galinat said Thursday. However, the town is still working to move more of Johnson’s downtown out of the floodplain. There have been preliminary conversations about moving the municipal building, he said.‘Restored and reimagined’Meanwhile, in Montpelier, the same July 2023 flood destroyed 5,000 donated books, the library’s main control systems and caused leaking from oil tanks at the Kellogg-Hubbard Library. Renovations have been ongoing, and a grand opening of the library’s basement is planned for May 3.According to a press release, the “restored and reimagined” lower level will hold the library’s year-round book sale, new meeting rooms and a dedicated break room for staff. In addition, it will be the new home for Elevate Youth Services’ basement teen center.According to Sarah Wisner, operations and communications coordinator for the library, the flood recovery work cost $2 million and was funded through insurance, donors and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster funding. The work was done with an eye toward flood resiliency, the press release said.Both public libraries are looking forward to their future — one hopefully free of flooding“We are thrilled to welcome everyone back into our restored space,” Kellogg-Hubbard Library Executive Director Dan Groberg said in the press release. “It’s a chance to come together, reflect on how far we’ve come, and look forward to an exciting future for our Library community.”Read the story on VTDigger here:   ‘Time to do something different’: Johnson’s library to roll across town, out of the floodplain, on Saturday.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Johnson-Public-Library-2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 17:08:28.111147

He was joined by first lady Kjersti Armstrong. (Photo provided by governor's office)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong went to a Bismarck elementary school Friday to sign a bill banning public school student cellphone use from “bell to bell.”
“This is a game changer for our public schools, giving students the freedom to focus on learning and to interact with teachers and friends without the constant tug of their cell phones and addictive social media,” Armstrong said in a statement.
House Bill 1160 would require public school districts to have policies requiring student cellphones be silenced and locked away during the entire school day on school grounds. The devices, including bluetooth-enabled devices, tablets, smartwatches or other wearable devices and gaming devices, must be stored in a lockable pouch, phone locker or other inaccessible locations.
The law allows students to use their phones while privately traveling to an off-site educational location, such as a career and technology center. It also allows school districts to craft their own cellphone-use policy during school-related noninstructional time, such as bus rides, field trips, sporting events and school dances.
Student cellphone bills pass North Dakota Legislature; bell-to-bell ban comes back

Students with medical needs that require an electronic monitoring device and students participating in individual education programs may be exempted from the law.
School districts will also be required to collect data and compile a report on the impact of its cellphone policies on student behavior, mental health, disciplinary incidents, school attendance and academic performance during the interim.
State Superintendent Kirsten Baesler said teachers have told her that student mental health challenges have become more “overwhelming.”
“This law gives students the gift of attention, connection, and presence. We are removing the constant pull of comparison and distraction and replacing it with space to learn and grow,” Baesler said in a statement.
The new law will go into effect Aug. 1.
Lawmakers also are considering Senate Bill 2354, which would also restrict student cellphone use in private schools. The bill is being debated in a conference committee between the House and Senate. The next committee meeting is scheduled for Monday morning.

Kristin McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) was sworn into the 119th U.S. Congress, resigning from her role as the Senator for Michigan’s 35th District. 
While McDonald Rivet’s seat has sat vacant for more than three months, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, has been sparse on the details of when the seat may be filled, as Republicans put forth a clarion call demanding a special election. 
“The other side likes to talk about threats to Democracy. The threat to Democracy is no representation here in Midland, Bay and Saginaw County,” Rep. Bill G. Schuette told audience members during Vice President J.D. Vance’s visit to Bay City on March 14. 
Alongside Republicans’ calls to fill the vacant seat, residents of the district have made their concerns known, traveling to Lansing on the date of the governor’s State of the State speech to demand a special election on the steps of the state Capitol.

On Thursday the nonpartisan voting rights group Common Cause joined the call, emphasizing that it is the governor’s duty to set a special election and general election dates, and noting that she’d previously called similar elections without dallying. The group’s Executive Director Quentin Turner suggested in a statement that the Legislature may need to take action to prevent further delays. 
While spokespeople for Whitmer did not respond to an emailed request for comment, the governor told WCMU on April 3 that her team was still reviewing dates, saying “At some point there will be one, but I don’t have an announcement to make yet.”
In an op-ed for the Detroit News, Senate Minority Leader and candidate for governor Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), said Whitmer has called 10 special elections across her six years in office, averaging about 17 days in fulfilling her constitutional obligation to call an election. 
  At a Feb. 26, 2025 press conference, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) holds up a button reading “Free the 35th” as he calls on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to call a special election in the state’s 35th Senate district. | Kyle Davidson
He further noted that Whitmer had called the special election to replace outgoing state Reps. Kevin Coleman (D-Westland) and Lori Stone (D-Warren) without delay. 
When Stone and Coleman won their mayoral elections in 2023, Democrats held a slim two-seat majority over Republicans. However, Coleman and Stone’s resignation left the House in a 54-54 deadlock until Reps. Mai Xiong (D-Warren) and Peter Herzberg were elected in April of last year. 
Speaking to the Michigan Advance on Friday, Turner noted that Democrats in the Michigan Senate currently hold a one-seat majority. While he could not speak to the governor’s motivations, the optics come across fairly partisan, Turner said. 
Calling a special election in the swing seat could see Democrats yielding further ground to Republicans, who took control of the Michigan House in the 2024 election, ending Democrats’ trifecta control of the House, Senate and governor’s office. If a Republican candidate claims victory in a special election, the chamber would be split 19-19.
While Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, a Democrat and president of the Senate, can break the tie in any party-line vote; all members must be present and voting. If any member is absent, a 19-18 vote on the bills would leave Gilchrist unable to vote, killing any legislation that fails to achieve a 20 vote majority.

Adrian Hemond, a Democratic consultant and the CEO and Chair of Grassroots Midwest in Lansing said it’s not uncommon for governors to play politics with when they call special elections as the Michigan Constitution gives them incredible broad discretion on when to do so.
“Whether this is a political or partisan decision to delay, it self-evidently is,” Hemond said. 
“If you proceed under the assumption that Republicans are quite likely to win a special election in this district, that means, functionally, that calling the special election is equivalent to giving away your Senate majority,” Hemond said. 
While Democrats could win the 35th Senate District, given McDonald Rivet’s 2022 victory, they would need the right candidate, as the seat has trended away from Democrats in recent election cycles, Hemond said.
Ultimately, Whitmer will call a special election when the political price for not calling the election is higher than the price for calling it, Hemond said, and Michigan Republicans have a long way to go to make that happen. 
In his op-ed, Nesbitt played on the themes of bipartisanship collaboration Whitmer expressed in her state of the state address, calling on her to work with whoever the next senator may be. 
“It should not be up to her or me or any other single elected official to determine if the state Senate operates with a new 19-19 tie or returns to a 20-18 split for the remainder of the current legislative term. That is a question for the voters of the 35th District,” Nesbitt said. 
In the meantime, nearly 270,000 residents have been left without representation as the Legislature continues to hold hearings and vote on bills. 
“There are a number of extremely important pieces of legislation that are moving through the House and the Senate in Lansing this year,” Turner said.
While lawmakers take up legislation that includes a proposal from State Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) that would place a Constitutional amendment requiring voters to show proof of citizenship when registering to vote and casting their ballot, Turner said Michigan voters deserve to have someone in Lansing advocating for them and their right to vote, alongside their other rights. 
Looking to legislative solutions, creating a hard timeline for calling a special election would be a good place to start, Turner said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250314_104536406-scaled-e1745613253510-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-04-25 17:08:28.111147

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)Two international students attending West Virginia colleges have been cleared to return to class after President Donald Trump’s administration abruptly reversed course on its plan to revoke their visas, the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia said Friday.
ACLU-WV sued the Trump administration on behalf of Sajawal Ali Sohail, a 25-year-old WVU computer science student from Pakistan and S.V., a 28-year-old Marshall graduate student from India. S.V. and Sohail were two of more than 1,000 international students around the country who were previously notified that their student visas were being revoked, putting them at risk for being deported.
“This is positive news not just for our two clients in West Virginia, but for international students across the country,” the ACLU-WV said in a statement Friday. “We are continuing to monitor the situation closely, particularly the announcement that ICE will be developing new policies for revoking legal statuses.
“We want to be clear that the administration is backing down not because it’s the right thing to do, but because they have been dragged to court repeatedly and lost again and again,” the organization said.

(Photo by ICE)Immigration rights advocates plan to gather outside the federal building and courthouse in downtown Providence at noon Sunday to protest the Trump administration’s mass deportation policies.
The demonstration follows the detention of a man who was hospitalized Thursday after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who came to his Providence home. Officers allegedly used a stun gun and the unnamed man appeared to have a medical episode and was taken to Rhode Island Hospital for treatment, said Maya Lehrer, an organizer with the Rhode Island Deportation Defense Coalition.
A crowd of 85 people protested outside Rhode Island Hospital for over three hours. The coalition says an attorney for the man was denied entrance to see him.
“Deportations are not new to Trump,” Lehrer said Friday. “But this particular kind of fearmongering and extreme racism has come along with it, and ICE feels empowered to do whatever they have to outside the legal means to seize our community members.” 
Lehrer said the coalition received a call around 11:08 a.m. Thursday reporting that a man was being detained by ICE agents at his home on Parade Street. At some point, officers used a stun gun and the unnamed man suffered a medical episode.



 
City spokesperson Josh Estrella confirmed the Providence Fire Department responded to a call for service on Parade Street for a person who had been tased, but said officials are unaware of any details of the investigation by any federal agency. 
Providence Police were not involved in the detainment, as Mayor Brett Smiley’s administration has made it clear that city officers will not act as immigration agents.
“We’re never going to collaborate, and we’re never going to interfere,” Estrella said.
ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Among the demonstrators gathered outside the hospital Thursday afternoon, was Providence City Council Chief of Staff June Rose, who attended on behalf of Council President Rachel Miller, whose ward includes the address where the man was detained by ICE.
“This community will not stand idly by as the Trump administration disappears our neighbors off the street,” Rose said in an interview Friday. “ICE shouldn’t be in our city at all.”
Shortly after the man arrived at Rhode Island Hospital, Central Falls-based immigration attorney Kelvin Santos said he was contacted to represent him. However, Santos said he was denied the opportunity to meet with his client, despite the man having signed a form confirming Santos as his legal representative.
“ICE wasn’t allowing us to go and see him and the hospital wasn’t trying to supersede what ICE was saying,” he said.
Brown University Health spokesperson Kelly Brennan declined to comment on the case, citing patient privacy.
“Rhode Island Hospital is committed to providing care to all our patients,” Brennan said in an emailed statement. “We follow the same protocols for all patients, including those concerning patient rights and access.”
Lehrer said multiple demonstrators had called ICE and claimed federal officials “seemed alarmed” when told that the man was denied his legal right to counsel. 
Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos issued a statement Thursday evening saying she and her office were “closely monitoring” the situation and called on ICE to immediately allow the man they detained to speak with his attorney.
“The rights enshrined in our Constitution, especially the right to due process, are our only safeguard against authoritarianism,” Matos said. “If we do not immediately and vocally protect the first people to be stripped of those rights, then eventually all people will be stripped of those rights.”
Thursday’s demonstration wrapped up around 4 p.m., the same time Rose said the man was discharged by the hospital. He now remains in ICE custody, but Santos said his client’s whereabouts are unknown.
“It’s in limbo right now,” Santos said. “We’re going to do our best to get in contact with him.”
The coalition claimed the man was taken in an unmarked van being driven by officers from the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls. But Wyatt officer Jim Louis told Rhode Island Current that no vans from the facility were dispatched to Rhode Island Hospital on Thursday.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)About 20,000 opioid overdose prevention kits will be distributed across South Dakota thanks to a partnership between the state and Sioux Falls-based nonprofit Emily’s Hope. The kits are filled with naloxone, an antidote for opioid overdoses, along with other resources and information.
Emily’s Hope founder and CEO Angela Kennecke, whose daughter died from a fentanyl overdose in 2018, announced the partnership in Sioux Falls on Friday alongside South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley, state Health Department Secretary Melissa Magstadt and state Social Services Department Secretary Matt Althoff.
The distribution is funded with $350,000 of South Dakota’s $78.6 million “and counting” in national opioid settlement funds, Jackley said. The national opioid settlements were reached to resolve opioid litigation against pharmaceutical distributors and manufacturers accused of flooding communities with opioid painkillers even though they allegedly knew how addictive and deadly the drugs were.
South Dakota will receive about $50 million over the next 15 years from the first settlement and will receive another $28.6 million over the next 17 years from a settlement with Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Teva and Allergan.
“That’s what is so important about this partnership is it’s putting those dollars back to work to save and protect people,” Jackley said.

Teva pharmaceuticals donated 2,313 kits for the effort and sold the other kits at a discounted rate to the state.
Ninety-five South Dakotans died from overdoses in 2023, according to the state Department of Health. Forty-seven of the deaths were opioid-related, and 39 of those were fentanyl-related, Magstadt said. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid.
“Since 2019, we’ve had a 70% increase in the amount of fentanyl deaths in South Dakota,” Magstadt said. “It’s hitting home.”
The program will target areas of the state impacted the most by opioid use, overdoses and death, officials said. The top 10 counties impacted, according to Emily’s Hope, are Minnehaha, Lincoln, Pennington, Corson, Roberts, Turner, Todd, Oglala Lakota, Beadle and Meade.
Although most overdose deaths are among white residents, Native Americans are disproportionately affected. Native Americans die from overdoses at a rate of 26.6 per 100,000 — more than four times the rate among white South Dakotans, according to the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System.
The kits will be placed in publicly accessible areas, Kennecke said. Emily’s Hope has been distributing naloxone kits, primarily in the Sioux Falls area, for nearly a year. The organization has distributed about 6,000 kits in that time.
Although most overdoses occur in private residences, they also happen in public restrooms, in traffic or on the street, Kennecke said. Offering them in public allows more bystanders to access the drug and intervene.
“Our goal is to have one of these kits in every house, in every business, by every AED possible,” Kennecke said. AEDs are automated external defibrillators that help people in cardiac arrest, many of which are stationed in public areas and offices throughout the state.

Magstadt called naloxone a “one more chance” medicine, since it halts overdose symptoms and opens a window for people to seek treatment for opioid use disorder. Administering naloxone will not harm someone who isn’t experiencing overdose, she said, and victims often appear sleepy while overdosing from opioid use.
The state has distributed about 15,000 naloxone kits in the last eight years to law enforcement, emergency medical services and schools across the state using a federal grant. About 3,600 kits have been distributed to public spaces through the new program so far.
South Dakota’s current plan in the Department of Social Services is to put a majority of settlement dollars into a trust fund to gain interest over time. Althoff said he wants to ensure the money is spent wisely rather than “spend this precious resource for the sake of spending.”
Jackley told South Dakota Searchlight he doesn’t agree with the trust fund approach and he’d rather see the funds be put toward prevention and treatment immediately. That includes funneling some of the settlement money toward rehabilitation for South Dakota prisoners, he said.
“Today, there was a minimal amount of money used from that settlement to save lives,” Jackley said. “We need to do more of that.”

CHICAGO — Just one day into her campaign to replace retiring Sen. Dick Durbin in the U.S. Senate, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton on Friday received a key endorsement from Gov. JB Pritzker, nearly eight years after he first tapped her to be his running mate.

Standing outside the Bright Star Church amid a backdrop of supporters in her native Bronzeville neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, Stratton on Friday framed herself as a Democrat who would take on the role of “fighter” against President Donald Trump’s administration.

The lieutenant governor criticized tech billionaire-turned-White House adviser Elon Musk as the president’s “unelected sidekick” and blamed them both for creating “a constant state of crisis” since taking power in January.

“While middle class families are stuck facing the consequences of Trump's chaos, too many in Washington are refusing to fight back,” Stratton said. “They're using the same old playbook that they've always used, and it's not working.”

Asked later whether she was referring to Durbin or his contemporaries like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, Stratton demurred, praising Durbin as a “true statesman” and saying she was “grateful for his leadership.”

“But you heard him say that it is time to pass the torch,” she said, referring to Durbin’s announcement Wednesday that he wouldn’t run for a sixth term. ""It's time to bring in new energy, new leadership, new vision, new voices. And that's exactly what I'm doing.”

Pritzker stood next to Stratton and referred to the lieutenant governor as his “partner in governance while we've achieved big things for Illinois.”

“Illinois deserves a United States senator who knows how to fight for us, a senator who will never cower when the moment calls for courage, a senator who will stand up when the White House says to bend the knee, a senator who loves her country and the working people who are its backbone,” Pritzker said.

The billionaire governor, who self-funded both his gubernatorial campaigns and has in recent years spent money on national political efforts as he flirts with the possibility of a White House run, declined to say Friday how much financial backing he’d give Stratton. While he dryly noted to reporters that the limit for individual campaign contributions for federal office is $3,500, there are other routes to funnel serious money into a Senate race.

Pritzker praised Stratton as a “champion for women’s rights, for job creation, for rural families, for farmers, for criminal justice, for early childhood education.” He credited the lieutenant governor as having played an integral role in his administration’s last six years.

“She governs with a zeal that few elected leaders can match, fueled by her lived experience as her mother's primary caregiver, as a mother herself and as a compassionate advocate for people,” Pritzker said.

Stratton often says her interest in politics stems from serving as her mother’s primary caretaker in a battle with Alzheimer’s disease.

The lieutenant governor has quickly risen through the ranks in Illinois politics, having barely served seven months in the Illinois House before she was announced as Pritzker's running mate in August 2017.

Her professional background includes working in administrative law for state agencies and as director of the University of Illinois Chicago’s Center for Public Safety and Justice.

But in political circles, her 2016 candidacy for the Illinois House shook up Springfield. Backed by then-House Speaker Michael Madigan’s political operation, Stratton unseated incumbent Democratic Rep. Ken Dunkin, who’d upset his own party by siding with then-Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner during a two-year budget impasse.

The 2016 Stratton-Dunkin face-off set spending records and even saw President Barack Obama get involved, endorsing Stratton.

Next year’s Democratic primary for Durbin’s Senate seat is already poised to get expensive. The Democratic Lieutenant Governor’s Association endorsed Stratton Thursday and announced it will spend at least $1 million to support her campaign.

Stratton also launched the Level Up federal political action committee in January, giving her a financial mechanism to influence federal campaigns or support her own run for office, as federal campaign finance rules prohibit the use of state campaign money for federal campaigns. The committee has not reported any fundraising as of Friday.

While Stratton was first out of the gate, other prominent Illinois Democrats are expected to enter the race. Durbin told reporters at his Springfield home Thursday he’s heard from several people interested in running for his seat.

“I’m not planning on endorsing any particular candidate,” Durbin said. “I hope I don’t have to but I’m not ruling out the possibility in an extreme case. I just think it’s up to the voters, the Democratic voters, to make this choice moving forward.”

Schaumburg Democratic U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, for example, spent Thursday on a three-stop tour in Chicago, Bloomington and Urbana — all outside his suburban district — focused on the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Krishnamoorthi has more than $19 million in his campaign account and told CNN Friday morning that he’d be making an announcement about his intentions for 2026 “shortly.”

Other expected Democratic hopefuls include U.S. Reps. Lauren Underwood of Naperville and Robin Kelly of Matteson. Durbin backed Kelly during her brief stint leading the Democratic Party of Illinois until she was ousted by Pritzker allies who installed state Rep. Lisa Hernandez, D-Cicero, in the role in 2022.

(Getty Images)Leaders from New Jersey’s four regulated utilities told a joint legislative panel Friday that the state could take greater steps to build power generation capacity and cautioned against some cost-saving proposals lawmakers have floated as ratepayers prepare for a double-digit utility bill hike this June.
Representatives of PSE&G, Jersey Central Power and Light, Rockland Electric Company, and Atlantic City Electric expressed willingness to play a role in electricity generation and billing changes that could spread high bills across multiple billing cycles. But they warned that lawmakers’ proposals to lower utility profitability or break with the state’s grid operator could do more harm than good.
“We recognize that this unfortunate increase will be delivered to our customers through bills with our name on it. This means whatever the facts are — and the facts are we are not responsible for this increase — we are involved. We recognize it and intend to be part of the solution,” said Richard Thigpen, senior vice president at PSE&G.
They warned against lowering utilities’ return on equity — the rate negotiated with state regulators at which they are allowed to profit on their investments — saying it could limit investor interest in New Jersey’s electric providers and imperil utilities’ ability to upgrade infrastructure in the long run.
In New Jersey, return on equity rates typically hover around 9.6% — for every dollar they invest, they receive $1.096 back from ratepayers — and can be supplemented by incentives at the federal level that lawmakers are considering blocking.
“Investors — if they’re not seeing the return that they’re looking for as part of that investment in us, they may choose to go elsewhere and invest their money elsewhere,” said Phil Vavala, region president for Atlantic City Electric. “That then could create the detrimental effect that ultimately would lead to investor disinterest that ultimately would then affect our ability to invest in the system.”
Joining a new grid operator would be no guarantee that ratepayers would get lower costs, they also warned.
“I think I would have a concern unless I was 100% sure that it would benefit the customers,” Alex Stern, an official with Exelon, the parent company of Atlantic City Electric. “I don’t know how it gets done in a way that doesn’t make it worse for the customer financially.”
New Jersey’s status as a net importer of energy and the continued loss of in-state net power generation as existing plants go offline pose significant hurdles to a break with New Jersey’s grid operator.
Democratic legislators have increasingly sought to blame PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey, 12 other states, and Washington D.C., for the spike in electricity costs, which is expected to add roughly $25 to a typical customer’s monthly electricity bill beginning on June 1. Gov. Phil Murphy last week asked federal regulators to investigate whether there had been any “market manipulation” that led to the price spike.
 Sen. Bob Smith (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex) renewed attacks against the interconnector Friday, charging without evidence that its voting members had colluded to push up energy capacity prices at a PJM-run capacity auction in July.
“I’d really like to know who sent the memo around, ‘Let’s everybody bid 10 times higher than last year.’ If that doesn’t smell like collusion, I don’t know what does,” he said.
Republican lawmakers have pointed to Murphy’s ambitious renewable energy goals as a cause of rising prices. That plan has focused chiefly on offshore wind farms, but each of those projects has been abandoned by developers or frozen by executive orders and other regulatory actions by the Trump administration.
Industry officials have said lower energy supply coupled with harsher weather and a steep spike in demand driven by artificial intelligence data centers after years of relatively stable electricity needs have driven bills and prices upward.
Utility officials said New Jersey could seek more in-state generation through legislative action or a bid process like the one used for the stalled wind projects.
Thigpen said the PSE&G had “almost zero confidence” that higher electricity prices alone would incent the development of more in-state generation.
New Jersey in 1999 deregulated energy generation in hopes that competition would bring down prices in what, before then, was a monopolized market. Since then, the regulated utilities — called electric distribution companies — have increasingly withdrawn from generation, preferring to transmit power generated by others across the infrastructure they own.
At present, only PSE&G, which operates nuclear plants in Salem County that account for roughly 40% of New Jersey’s in-state generation, creates any electricity in New Jersey, though representatives from all four regulated utilities expressed willingness to play a bigger role in generation Friday.
The timelines, costs, and political uncertainties associated with new generation make nuclear an unattractive power source to provide relief in the short term, Thigpen said.
Such projects take about a decade and billions of dollars to stand up, he said, and could lay at the whims of a future administration or Legislature. If a nuclear project approved under one administration was blocked by a subsequent one, the utility’s investment would be in a precarious position, he noted.
“Now, we’ve spent several billion dollars, and the state is no longer behind it,” Thigpen said, speaking hypothetically. “That is what I would call political risk.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma State University’s governing board on Friday appointed Jim Hess to serve as the school’s 20th president for the next three years.
Oklahoma State University A&M Board of Regents said in a statement that Hess, who had been serving as interim president, has proven he’s the right person to lead the state’s second largest university. 
The board’s statement did not say why Hess was appointed for only a three-year term.  
“Dr. Hess has proven himself as the right leader at the right time for Oklahoma State University,” said Board Chairman Jimmy Harrel. “His deep understanding of OSU’s land-grant mission gives our board complete confidence in his ability to lead the university forward.”
The board had tapped Hess to serve as interim president in February following the abrupt resignation of Kayse Shrum, the university’s first female president. Officials have not said what led Shrum to step down after slightly more than three years at the helm. 
“While we could have spent an entire year searching for a new president, seeing Jim’s work up close over the past months has provided a level of insight and confidence that no interviews with outside candidates would have yielded,” said Rick Walker, the board’s vice chair. “His positive impact across the OSU community has been swift. He immediately took action on key issues and legislative priorities, and his engagement with OSU’s students, faculty, and staff has restored much-needed connections and stability throughout the institution.”
Hess brings 43 years of experience working in higher education to the role. He most recently served as vice provost for graduate programs at the OSU Center for Health Sciences. 
He earned a bachelor’s and master’s from Northeastern State University and a doctorate in education from OSU.
Hess said he was honored and excited about the university’s future.
“We launch this journey with an urgency of purpose and the confidence that we can change lives, transform education, and pave the way for the next generation of Cowboys,” Hess said.

Jon Ossoff faced pointed questions from fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention workers and others at a Marietta town hall meeting Friday.
The Atlanta-based CDC has seen mass layoffs as part of the Trump administration’s widespread government cuts.
Frustrated former employees at the town hall said the firings are misguided and will harm public health. Several members of a group called Fired but Fighting said Ossoff is not doing enough to help.

“We want to know why we have gotten no response from your staff,” asked Abby Tighe, a former public health advisor in the CDC’s division of overdose prevention who was let go in February. “We are a huge coalition. We have emailed, we have called, we have tried many times to meet with you and your staff to talk about the concerns that we have from public health, and we have been ignored. We are a huge constituency and we protect you and everyone else in this room from public health disaster.”
Tighe also asked what Ossoff will do as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee to help fund public health.
“Let me say that this is what democracy is all about, folks, and I welcome tough questions,” Ossoff said. “I welcome criticism. I ask to be held accountable. That’s the purpose of events like this, and unlike some of my colleagues, we have not pre-screened these questions. I’m not reading them from a list that my staff gave me. We’re opening it up to my constituents.”
That last part was a dig at Rome Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who held a town hall not far from Marietta last week and is reportedly considering a run for Ossoff’s seat when he is up for re-election next year.
Ossoff’s seat is seen as one of the most vulnerable in the nation and his race is expected to be expensive, hard-fought and close.
Ossoff told the Fired but Fighting members that he supports them and pledged to meet with them in the coming days to discuss how to provide further assistance.

“CDC accounts, other (Health and Human Services) public health accounts, and global health accounts will be among my priorities on the Appropriations Committee – provided we can get bipartisan cooperation to do an actual budget,” he said. “You’ll recall what happened just a couple of months ago, when, on a partisan basis, Republicans in Congress basically signed a blank check for the administration. I will work to avoid that. I will work to make sure that CDC funding, HHS public health funding, and global health funding are robust and protected, and I will continue to do everything I can to hold accountable (United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.) and the new leadership of CDC for these outrageous cuts to the CDC’s workforce, which put the American people at risk.”
Speaking after the town hall, Tighe said she is still skeptical but said she is encouraged by the offer for a meeting and the chance to work together for fired workers.
“I would love for him to talk more about how he’s trying to fold in Republicans who might care about public health,” she said. “I’m not hearing anybody talk about that and I would love to see kind of how that’s working or at least giving us the opportunity to come and help him develop talking points to bring more people into the fold because this is going to have to be a big tent.”
Georgia Republicans have been largely indifferent to the CDC cuts publicly. After the first round in February, Gov. Brian Kemp, who is another potential Senate challenger, said “government can stand a little right-sizing.” Suwanee Republican U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick said he asked the White House to slow the pace of the firings after being caught in the crosshairs of an angry town hall, telling the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in February that “I think we’re just moving a little too fast.”
Sarah Boim, a former communication specialist with the CDC, also welcomed the chance for a meeting.
“I’m shocked that he has not been standing up more because we drive a lot of the economic activity where we live and we’re generally blue voters so he should be listening to us,” she said.

Kate Denny, a mom from Avondale Estates, expressed frustration at what she characterized as a lack of opposition in opposing Trump.
“You keep saying that there isn’t a magic button, and I recognize that you’re a senator and not in the House, and everything that Trump is doing is leading us down (the path to) authoritative rule. Why are there no calls for impeachment?” she said.
“Do you think that there’s nothing more that can be done? No! Do something more. I like you, and I will vote for you if you are brave and you do what we need,” she added.
Ossoff said he understands the frustration and that he believes Trump’s conduct “has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment by the United States House of Representatives.”
“I also have no choice but to be candid with you about the situation that we face and the tools that are at our disposal, as strongly as I agree with you,” he added. “And I regret if this is an unwelcome response, but my job is to be honest with you. The only way to achieve what you want to achieve is to have a majority of the United States House of Representatives. Believe me, I’m working on it every single day, every single day.”
Responding to the exchange on X, the National Republican Senatorial Committee called Ossoff’s comments “disgusting.”
“Of course, Senator Jon @ossoff wants to overturn the will of Georgia voters who just elected President Trump.”
Trump, who narrowly lost Georgia in 2020, defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in Georgia last year by about 115,000 votes, winning with about 50.7% of the vote in a politically divided state.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 20:17:37+00:00,CT Mirror,"ICE is reversing termination of legal status for international students around US, lawyers say",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/ice-student-visa-reverse-course/,"The decision comes after many court challenges were filed against the Trump administration crackdown, government lawyers said Friday.","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The federal government is reversing the termination of legal status for international students around the U.S. after many filed court challenges against the Trump administration crackdown, government lawyers said Friday.
The records in a federal student database maintained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been terminated in recent weeks, often without the students or their schools being notified. Judges around the country had already issued orders temporarily restoring the students’ records in dozens of lawsuits challenging the terminations.
More than 1,200 students nationwide suddenly lost their legal status or had visas revoked, leaving them at risk for deportation. Many said they had only minor infractions on their record or did not know why they were targeted. Some left the country while others have gone into hiding or stopped going to class.
Government says it will restore student status
In one of the lawsuits, Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Kurlan read a statement in federal court in Oakland, California, that said ICE was restoring the student status for people whose records were terminated in recent weeks. A similar statement was read by a government attorney in a separate case in Washington, said lawyer Brian Green, who represents the plaintiff in that case. Green provided The Associated Press with a copy of the statement that the government lawyer emailed to him.
It says: “ICE is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations. Until such a policy is issued, the SEVIS records for plaintiff(s) in this case (and other similarly situated plaintiffs) will remain Active or shall be re-activated if not currently active and ICE will not modify the record solely based on the NCIC finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS record termination.”
SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database that tracks international students’ compliance with their visa status. NCIC is the National Crime Information Center, which is maintained by the FBI.
Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant Homeland Security secretary, said ICE had not reversed course on any visa revocations but did “restore SEVIS access for people who had not had their visa revoked.”
Greg Chen, with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said some uncertainty remained: “It is still unclear whether ICE will restore status to everyone it has targeted and whether the State Department will help students whose visas were wrongly revoked.”
Legal fights may not be over
Green, who is involved in lawsuits on behalf of several dozen students, said his cases only sought restoration of the student status and that he would be withdrawing them as a result of the statement Friday from ICE.
But lawyers in the Oakland case are seeking a nationwide order from the court prohibiting the government from arresting or incarcerating students, transferring them to places outside their district or preventing them from continuing work or studies.
Pam Johann, a government lawyer, said it was premature to consider anything like that given that ICE was in the process of reactivating student status records and developing a policy. “We should take a pause while ICE is implementing this change that plaintiffs are seeking right now, on its own,” she said.
But U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White asked her to humor the court and clarify ICE’s statement.
“It seems like with this administration there’s a new world order every single day,” he said. “It’s like whack-a-mole.”
Visa revocations and student status terminations caused confusion
Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said his department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel’s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges. But many students whose status was terminated said they did not fall under those categories.
A survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs research found that that even the visa revocations for students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests are not popular. About half of U.S. adults oppose this policy, and only 3 in 10 are in support. Among college educated adults, 6 in 10 strongly oppose, compared with 4 in 10 who aren’t college graduates.
In lawsuits in several states, students argued they were denied due process. Many were told that their status was terminated as a result of a criminal records check or that their visa had been revoked.
International students and their schools were caught off guard by the terminations of the students’ records. Many of the terminations were discovered when school officials were doing routine checks of the international student database.
Jodie Ferise, a higher education attorney in Indiana, said some students at schools her law firm works with already left the country after receiving instructions to self-deport.
“This unprecedented treatment of student status had caused tremendous fear among international students,” Ferise said. “Some of them were too frightened to wait and hope for the administration to change course.”
Earlier this week, before the government’s reversal, Ferise said the situation could hurt international student enrollment.
“The world is watching, and we will lose students, not just by the technical revocation of their status, but by the message we’re sending that we don’t want them anyway and that it isn’t safe to even try to go to school here,” she said.
At least 1,220 students at 187 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records. The AP has been working to confirm reports of hundreds more students who are caught up in the crackdown.

Patrick Morrisey speaks in Morgantown, W.Va., during the signage of Senate Bill 196 on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (West Virginia Office of the Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Thursday signed into law a bill to drastically increase criminal penalties for dealing and transporting certain types of drugs in West Virginia.
Senate Bill 196 — dubbed Lauren’s Law in honor of a Morgantown woman who died in 2020 after accidentally overdosing on drugs laced with fentanyl — passed the Legislature during the last days of the 2025 regular session.
The bill introduces mandatory minimum sentences into state code for transporting cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl into West Virginia and removes alternative sentencing options — like probation or home confinement — for those who are jailed on those charges.
It also increases sentences against those charged with manufacturing, delivering or possessing with the intent to deliver a Schedule I or II narcotic or meth from one to five years up to three to 15 years. 
Anyone who is charged with those crimes who has more than five grams of fentanyl, among other quantities of other drugs, could face 10 to 30 years in jail.
The law uses weight requirements that can make someone delivering a drug containing any fentanyl to be charged with conspiracy. It also includes language for the crime of delivering a drug that results in someone’s death, with increased penalties for failing to render aid to someone who is overdosing.
During the bill signing on Thursday, Morrisey said he believes the law will be crucial to enhancing enforcement against drug crimes and deterring drug dealers from operating in the state.
“In West Virginia, we all know we’ve had a long and arduous history fighting substance abuse. It goes back many, many decades, and it’s ripped through our communities like a vengeance. It’s destroyed many lives. It’s laid waste to generations of West Virginia,” Morrisey said. “Lauren’s Law, we think, can be instrumental in helping our state deal with the drug epidemic. It’s part of the enforcement side of the equation, and it takes direct aim at the drug dealers.”
But advocates for people who use drugs and people in recovery worry that the law will do more harm than good. 
Oftentimes, people who use drugs are also dealing them as a way to pay for their addictions. And it’s not uncommon for individuals to be unaware that the drugs they are using or dealing contain fentanyl, advocates told West Virginia Watch upon the passage of SB 192 in the Legislature.
This bill, the advocates say, could open up low-level dealers to heightened penalties that will make it even more difficult for them to get help for their disease.
There is no data that shows stronger drug penalties anywhere curbing overdose or fatality rates related to the drug epidemic.
Instead of seeing higher criminal penalties that could have unintended consequences for people with substance use disorder, those in recovery and addiction spheres would like to see the state focus more on public health investments that are proven to lessen the impact of addiction on communities.
But SB 196 was only one of a handful of bills that was passed by the Legislature this session concerning drugs or addiction. And none of the bills that did pass related to public health initiatives, treatment for addiction or support for people with substance use disorder.
“The answer [to the opioid epidemic] is in public health investment. The last few years, we’ve seen our state — thanks to COVID federal funding — make additional investments in public health resources, in getting opioid reversal drugs into the hands of people who are using and people who care about them, and we’ve seen the fruits of that,” Sara Whitaker, the senior criminal legal policy analyst at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, told West Virginia Watch earlier this month. “SB 196 has none of that, and it’s not going to change anything for the better.”

(Photo via Getty Images; DIAL logo courtesy of Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing)State, city and county inspectors have cited Iowa restaurants and stores for hundreds of food-safety violations during the past four weeks, including serious offenses related to rodents, rotten vegetables and other issues.
The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level. Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, schools, hospitals and other businesses over the past four weeks. (It appears that DIAL has not updated its online food-inspection database since April 17, so this story does not include any inspections that took place after that date.)
The inspections department reminds the public that their reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment.

Pizza Hut, 1616 N. 2nd St., Clinton — During an April 4 visit, a state inspector cited the establishment for handwashing violations, a lack of sanitizing solution for the dishwasher, and for multiple products — including sausage, chicken, cheese and ham — that were stored in a cooler despite being labeled “keep frozen.” Also, wire shelving in the kitchen was soiled with grease, food debris, and dust, as were the kitchen walls and the exterior surfaces of some kitchen equipment.
The inspector also noted a “dark, gummy residue on the floor in the walk-in cooler, and a similar dark residue on the floor in the walk-in freezer.” The inspection was in response to “multiple non-illness complaints” pertaining to facility cleanliness, employee hygiene, food temperatures, lack of date-marking, and staff supervision. The complaints were deemed verified, the inspector reported.
La Casa Maya 2, 101 SE 2nd St., State Center — During an April 17 visit, a state inspector observed a worker handling raw meat and then handling ready-to-eat food without disposing of their soiled gloves or washing their hands between the two tasks. In the refrigerated food-preparation table in the kitchen, sliced lettuce was being held at 47 degrees, sliced tomatoes at 47 degrees and pico de gallo at 46 degrees — too warm to ensure their safety.
Inside a walk-in cooler, the inspector found cooked chicken and cooked pork carnitas that were not marked with a preparation date or a discard date. In addition, there was red salsa and queso cheese dip that had been prepared April 9, eight days prior to the inspection, which had to be discarded. Also, the handwashing sink in the kitchen was unable to produce hot water and there was no hand soap available.
The inspector also reported that cooked birria, cooked ground beef and cooked pork carnitas were being cooled in “full, deep pans” inside a walk-in cooler, slowing the cooling process and creating potential risks, and fish was being thawed while still inside vacuum-sealed packaging, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected. In addition, the inspector reported there were sticky traps for flying insects hanging over the food preparation area in the kitchen, and multiple pans of cooked beans and a large pot of cooked birria were being stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler.
Red Ginger, 1301 S. Gilbert St., Iowa City — During an April 17 visit, a Johnson County inspector observed that two food employees didn’t wash their hands before donning gloves and handling food. Also, all of the containers of raw seafood and vacuum-sealed fish in the sushi section’s coolers were storing food above the maximum temperature of 41 degrees. Because the person in charge stated the food had been there less than four hours, the items were relocated to the restaurant’s main refrigeration unit to ensure they were chilled to a safe holding temperature.
In addition, one refrigerator contained raw chicken and raw shrimp that was being held at 45 to 57 degrees. Because the person in charge stated the items had been there less than three hours, they were relocated to the main refrigerator for cooling. The inspector also noted that several containers of prepared foods in the walk-in cooler had no date markings to ensure freshness and safety.
In addition, the dishwasher was not reaching 165 degrees and was in need of repairs; the handwashing sink could not produce hot water; the sanitizing solution used in the sushi section was too highly concentrated, making it too strong for safe use; fish was being thawed while still in vacuum-sealed packaging, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected; and all of the coolers used in the sushi section were unable to maintain a temperature of 41 degrees or below.
Also, the shelving units inside the walk-in cooler had an “excessive buildup of dust, debris and rust” on their surfaces, and there was a buildup of food and debris on the floors of the walk-in freezer.
St. Kilda Collective, 333 5th St., West Des Moines — During an April 15 visit, a state inspector observed a food-service employee eating while washing items and another worker handling ready-to-eat toast with their bare hands. Also, raw chicken was being stored above raw salmon inside a cooler, risking cross-contamination, and cooked sausage links were being held at 75 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure safe consumption. In addition, a slicer used two days before the inspection remained visibly soiled, and both handwashing stations in the kitchen had no hand soap available and no single-use towels for hand drying.
Beaver Tap, 4050 Urbandale Ave., Des Moines — During an April 15 visit, a state inspector cited the restaurant for 12 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number, and determined that not all of the employees designated as “the person in charge” were certified food protection managers as required, and that the person in charge at the time of the inspection was not fulfilling their duties as evidenced by the number and type of violations cited.
The inspector reported finding “prepared wings” that were left out and which measured 93 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure safe consumption. Inside a walk-in cooler, the inspector found wings that were measured at 73 degrees and 89 degrees, and rice that was measured at 93 degrees and 44 degrees. The inspector also found Raid insecticide that was not approved for use in a food-service establishment, and food items, such as ground meat and pasta, that were cooling at room temperature inside deep, covered containers, which slowed the cooling process.
The inspector also reported food debris and a buildup of grease on the floors, under equipment, on storage shelving and on the walk-in cooler’s floor and shelves. The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint that was deemed verified, although the inspector’s report does not describe the nature of the complaint.
JW’s Pub and Grub, 58 SW Miller Ave., Cedar Rapids — During an April 11 visit, a Linn County inspector cited this establishment for eight risk-factor violations. The inspector noted that an employee was observed handling warmed breadsticks with her bare hands, and that biscuits dated April 4 were expired and had to be discarded. Also, macaroni and cheese had been heated in a microwave to 57 degrees rather than 165 degrees or hotter, utensils were being “stored in a container of water,” and there was no sanitizing solution prepared at the time of the inspection.










Heavy presence of mice and mouse droppings in the establishment ... Mouse-like droppings present on floors, cabinets, and racks.


– Scott County food-safety inspector commenting on Golden Mart in Davenport


Golden Mart, 1026 W. River Drive, Davenport — During a March 31 visit, a Scott County inspector observed “bags of chips” that were chewed open by mice and found that prepared salads were being “stored with raw chicken in the walk-in cooler.” Also, potatoes were being stored on the floor of the kitchen, and corn dogs and burritos that were stored in a hot-holding display unit were measured at 115 to 120 degrees — too cool to ensure they were safe to eat. The food was discarded with the inspector noting that the hot-holding unit may need to be replaced.
The inspector also noted that the potato cutter, the freezers in the kitchen, the Slushie machine, the fountain-drink machine, the racks inside the walk-in coolers, and the coffee machines were each marred by “debris and gunk.” Also, chicken livers were left out to thaw at room temperature, and racks and cabinets in the retail sales area were marred by debris and rodent droppings.
“Heavy presence of mice and mouse droppings in the establishment,” the inspector reported. “Mouse-like droppings present on floors, cabinets, and racks.”
The visit was in response to a complaint related to cross-contamination of food items and and general sanitation. The complaint was deemed verified.
Bickford Cottage, 101 New Castle Road, Marshalltown — During an April 11 visit to this assisted living center, a state inspector cited the facility for 10 risk-factor violations and noted the center had no certified food protection manager on staff. The inspector observed that a jar of jelly used for a recent meal was not sourced from an approved vendor and was canned at home by an employee.
Also, an open package of ham was stored inside the same container as raw ground pork, risking cross-contamination, and raw fish fillets were cooked to a temperature of only 115 degrees until the inspector intervened and instructed the staff to continue cooking the fillets. Also, there was no detectable level of sanitizer in the sanitizing solution that was being used, and the interior of the ice machine had a buildup “of red/brown” material on the dispenser.
Also, the food thermometers that were on hand appeared to be inaccurate, with one of the devices showing a deviation of 30 degrees when compared to a calibrated food thermometer. The inspector also noted that a large pork roast was stored in an opened package with the meat uncovered and exposed, risking contamination, and that the interior of a residential style refrigerator was marred by a buildup of food debris and spills. The facility’s kitchen last underwent a food-safety inspection in September 2023, according to state records.
The Buffalo Tavern, 2016 S. Main St., Burlington — During an April 10 visit, a Lee County inspector cited this establishment for holding cheesy potatoes, gravy, and cheese sauce at 115 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure safe consumption. Also, the inspector reported, there was a “waitress prep cooler temping at 60 degrees with ranch and other sauces” — an apparent reference to a cooler that wasn’t keeping sauces at 41 degrees or colder.
In addition, several food items — including coleslaw, potatoes and sauces — had to be discarded as they had no date-markings to indicate when they were prepared or would expire. The establishment also discarded a pan of cooked hamburger that was not date-marked, and a container of homemade “special sauce” that was dated Feb. 23, six weeks prior the inspection.
In addition, the tavern’s mechanical dishwasher was not dispensing enough sanitizing solution, a food slicer in the kitchen was visibly soiled with a buildup of food, and the reach-in freezer, reach-in prep cooler, walk-in cooler and microwave oven were each marred by a buildup of food and debris. The inspector said there were issues with “general facility sanitation throughout the kitchen” and noted that the kitchen walls were visibly soiled with a buildup of some kind.
Fas Mart, 2175 Central Ave., Dubuque — During an April 9 visit, a city inspector noted the store was unable to provide documentation of any workers being currently certified as food protection managers. The inspector reported that an open retail-display cooler was holding packages of hot dogs at 47 degrees, sliced cheese at 44 degrees, a chicken salad sandwich at 47 degrees, and butter at 47 degrees. All of the items were discarded.
The inspector also found “multiple sandwiches, wraps and pre-made burritos” that had sell-by dates of April 2 and April 7, and which had to be discarded. In addition, the hot water in the handwashing sinks of both restrooms reached only 75 degrees, and there was no temperature-measuring device in the cooler that held food items for the store’s roller grill.
Swagat Indian Restaurant, 1108 Locust St., Dubuque — During an April 9 visit, a city inspector found yogurt made two days prior to the inspection in three separate five-gallon pails that had yet to cool to 41 degrees or colder and had to be discarded.
Also, the inspector reported finding multiple cooked foods — including yogurt, chicken, a spinach dish, and chickpeas — that were prepared more than 24 hours previously but which lacked any date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. All of the items were discarded. The inspector also determined the restaurant was producing homemade yogurt without the required variance or regulatory approval. In addition, the restaurant had not posted its most recent inspection report for customers to read.
Joensy’s Restaurant, 2563 N. Dodge St., Iowa City — During an April 8 visit, a Johnson County inspector noted the establishment did not employ a certified food protection manager as required. Also, “rotten and moldy tomatoes were observed stored in the walk-in cooler,” and raw eggs were being stored above ready-to-eat food inside the cooler, risking cross-contamination.
The inspector also noted that “multiple containers of food” within the walk-in cooler were left uncovered, creating a risk of contamination, and several containers of prepared foods and sauces lacked any date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. Debris was observed on a can opener, a food slicer, and two sets of tongs, although none of the equipment had been used that day.
Several containers of food were being stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler and tongs were stored on a soiled rag between uses. The inspector also noted a buildup of debris on the walls and floor. The establishment’s most recent previous routine inspection was in February 2021, although there were several complaint-driven inspections or follow-up visits since that time.










Very little date-marking was being done in the facility. Most date-marks appeared to have been put on as the inspection occurred.


– Linn County inspector commenting on Oyama Sushi Japanese Steakhouse in Cedar Rapids


Oyama Sushi Japanese Steakhouse, 5350 NE Council St., Cedar Rapids — During an April 8 visit, a Linn County inspector cited this establishment for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector reported seeing employees handling raw meat and seafood with gloved hands, then handling ready-to-eat food without first washing their hands. In addition, several different species of raw food products were stored in the same containers, risking cross-contamination, and several coolers had containers of food that were left uncovered.
Also, the sushi preparation area did not have separate equipment for handling the raw and cooked products, and single-use gloves were seen being washed in a sanitizer bucket and then reused. In addition, cooked rice was being held at 44 to 49 degrees and had to be discarded. “Very little date-marking was being done in the facility,” the inspector reported. “Most date-marks appeared to have been put on as the inspection occurred.”
The inspector also noted that access to the kitchen’s handwashing sink was blocked by empty kegs and sacks intended for to-go orders were being used to store raw meat.
“Line coolers and line equipment were soiled on the insides and outsides,” the inspector reported. The visit was in response to an illness complaint which the inspector concluded was not verified.
A Taste of China, 30 Pearl St., Council Bluffs — During a March 24 visit, a state inspector found that the restaurant had no date-marking system in place to ensure that any of its food was safe and fresh. In addition, precooked chicken and eggs rolls were being held at room temperature and were not marked with the time at which they needed to be discarded.

Carlos Collins. Bailey Mae Reed. 
They are among Mississippi domestic violence homicide victims whose family members carried their photos as the governor signed a bill that will establish a board to study such deaths and how to prevent them. 
Tara Gandy, who lost her daughter Napier in Waynesboro in 2022, said it’s a moment she plans to tell her 5-year-old grandson about when he is old enough. Napier’s presence, in spirit, at the bill signing can be another way for her grandson to feel proud of his mother. 
“(The board) will allow for my daughter and those who have already lost their lives to domestic violence … to no longer be just a number,” Gandy said. “They will be a number with a purpose.” 
Family members at the April 15 private bill signing included Ashla Hudson, whose son Collins, died last year in Jackson. Grandparents Mary and Charles Reed and brother Colby Kernell attended the event in honor of Bailey Mae Reed, who died in Oxford in 2023. 
Joining them were staff and board members from the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the statewide group that supports shelters and advocated for the passage of Senate Bill 2886 to form a Domestic Violence Facility Review Board. 
The law will go into effect July 1, and the coalition hopes to partner with elected officials who will make recommendations for members to serve on the board. The coalition wants to see appointees who have frontline experience with domestic violence survivors, said Luis Montgomery, public policy specialist for the coalition. 
A spokesperson from Gov. Tate Reeves’ office did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
Establishment of the board would make Mississippi the 45th state to review domestic violence fatalities. 
Montgomery has worked on passing a review board bill since December 2023. After an unsuccessful effort in 2024, the coalition worked to build support and educate people about the need for such a board. 
In the recent legislative session, there were House and Senate versions of the bill that unanimously passed their respective chambers. Authors of the bills are from both political parties. 
The review board is tasked with reviewing a variety of documents to learn about the lead up and circumstances in which people died in domestic violence-related fatalities, near fatalities and suicides – records that can include police records, court documents, medical records and more. 
From each review, trends will emerge and that information can be used for the board to make recommendations to lawmakers about how to prevent domestic violence deaths. 
“This is coming at a really great time because we can really get proactive,” Montgomery said. 
Without a board and data collection, advocates say it is difficult to know how many people have died or been injured in domestic-violence related incidents.
A Mississippi Today analysis found at least 300 people, including victims, abusers and collateral victims, died from domestic violence between 2020 and 2024. That analysis came from reviewing local news stories, the Gun Violence Archive, the National Gun Violence Memorial, law enforcement reports and court documents. 
Some recent cases the board could review are the deaths of Collins, Napier and Reed. 
In court records, prosecutors wrote that Napier, 24, faced increased violence after ending a relationship with Chance Fabian Jones. She took action, including purchasing a firearm and filing for a protective order against Jones.
Jones’s trial is set for May 12 in Wayne County. His indictment for capital murder came on the first anniversary of her death, according to court records. 
Collins, 25, worked as a nurse and was from Yazoo City. His ex-boyfriend Marcus Johnson has been indicted for capital murder and shooting into Collins’ apartment. Family members say Collins had filed several restraining orders against Johnson. 
Johnson was denied bond and remains in jail. His trial is scheduled for July 28 in Hinds County.  
He was a Jackson police officer for eight months in 2013. Johnson was separated from the department pending disciplinary action leading up to immediate termination, but he resigned before he was fired, Jackson police confirmed to local media. 
Reed, 21, was born and raised in Michigan and moved to Water Valley to live with her grandparents and help care for her cousin, according to her obituary. 
Kylan Jacques Phillips was charged with first degree murder for beating Reed, according to court records. In February, the court ordered him to undergo a mental evaluation to determine if he is competent to stand trial, according to court documents. 
At the bill signing, Gandy said it was bittersweet and an honor to meet the families of other domestic violence homicide victims.
“We were there knowing we are not alone, we can travel this road together and hopefully find ways to prevent and bring more awareness about domestic violence,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/25145307/SB-2886-signing-with-gov.jpeg,,,2025-04-25 17:08:28.111147

The panel, comprised of all George W. Bush-appointed judges, ordered state officials last week to, again, craft a new Senate map for the area in the suburbs of Memphis. The has held that none of the state’s prior maps gave Black voters a realistic chance to elect candidates of their choice. 
The latest map proposed by the all-Republican State Board of Election Commissioners tweaked only four Senate districts in northwest Mississippi and does not pit any incumbent senators against each other. 
The state’s proposal would keep the Senate districts currently held by Sen. Michael McLendon, a Republican from Hernando and Sen. Kevin Blackwell, a Republican from Southaven, in majority-white districts. 
But it makes Sen. David Parker’s district a slightly majority-Black district. Parker, a white Republican from Olive Branch, would run in a district with a 50.1% black voting-age population, according to court documents. 
The proposal also maintains the district held by Sen. Reginald Jackson, a Democrat from Marks, as a majority-Black district, although it reduces the Black voting age population from 61% to 53%.  
Gov. Tate Reeves, Secretary of State Michael Watson, and Attorney General Lynn Fitch comprise the State Board of Election Commissioners. Reeves and Watson voted to approve the plan. But Watson, according to meeting documents, expressed a wish that the state had more time to consider different proposals. 
Fitch did not attend the meeting, but Deputy Attorney General Whitney Lipscomb attended in her place. Lipscomb voted against the map, although it is unclear why. Fitch’s office declined to comment on why she voted against the map because it involves pending litigation. 
The reason for redrawing the districts is that the state chapter of the NAACP and Black voters in the state sued Mississippi officials for drawing legislative districts in a way that dilutes Black voting power. 
The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, are likely to object to the state’s newest proposal, and they have until April 29 to file an objection with the court
The plaintiffs have put forward two alternative proposals for the area in the event the judges rule against the state’s plans. 
The first option would place McLendon and Blackwell in the same district, and the other would place McLendon and Jackson in the same district. 
It is unclear when the panel of judges will issue a ruling on the state’s plan, but they will not issue a ruling until the plaintiffs file their remaining court documents next week. 
While the November election is roughly six months away, changing legislative districts across counties and precincts is technical work, and local election officials need time to prepare for the races. 
The judges have not yet ruled on the full elections calendar, but U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Leslie Southwick said at a hearing earlier this month that the panel was committed have the elections in November.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/01184715/Voting-15.jpg,,,2025-04-25 16:07:03.792823

Photo by Gordon Miller/News & BridgeThis story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on April 24.Lamoille Health Partners took quick action to avoid the eviction of its dental offices in Morrisville Plaza earlier this month, catching up on payments in arrears just as its landlord filed documents accusing the health care nonprofit of breaching its lease contract.Savoy-Texas, LLC, the Delaware-incorporated group that owns the building occupied by Lamoille Family Dentistry, alleged in court filings that Lamoille Health Partners owed $50,000 in lease payments.Peter Anderson, chair of the Lamoille Health board of directors, said the organization had caught up on lease payments just prior to the legal filing and that it was being withdrawn.Lamoille Health Partners is also facing a lawsuit filed by its former Stowe landlords after it withdrew its primary care clinic earlier this year. The legal claim filed by Grandview Farms alleges it is owed $240,000 in back rent and an unpaid share of common-area maintenance of the building.Susan Bartlett, Lamoille Health board member and interim CEO, said the organization’s failure to make its lease payments on the Morrisville dentistry was due to a lack of cash on hand, but the situation was stabilizing.Bartlett said the goal now is to make more efficient use of the space at the dentistry office and consolidate some of its services there. Lamoille Health Partners, a federally qualified health center that provides primary care, pediatric care, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and dental care to around 19,000 people, is currently undergoing an organization-wide, $2 million cost-cutting effort and exploring a merger with Copley Hospital.The dentistry, one of the few in the Lamoille County area that accepts adult patients with Medicaid insurance, has a months-long waitlist for new patient appointments.Lamoille Health’s federally qualified status allows it to be reimbursed by Medicaid at a higher rate than other health care providers and allows patients to pay for services on a sliding scale, but its already dire financial situation is further challenged by massive cuts to Medicaid being considered at the federal level by the Republican-controlled Congress.Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, R-Glover, raised the alarm regarding the potentially devastating health care cuts being considered at a recent Lamoille County legislative breakfast and again at a forum hosted by Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., in Stowe earlier this month, calling out specifically the threat posed to the state’s 11 federally qualified health centers.Bartlett, who served as Lamoille County’s state senator for decades, said she didn’t envy current lawmakers and called the threatened cuts “truly terrifying.”“It’s the chaos of not knowing,” she said. “Once you know, you can start to make some concrete plans and start to make what will be difficult choices, but it’s so hard to do any of that when you don’t know what’s going to happen.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Morristown dental clinic avoids eviction.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/waterville-elementary-1.jpg?fit=750%2C554&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 16:07:03.792823

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington House Democrats late Thursday approved a multibillion-dollar transportation revenue package anchored by a 6-cent increase to the state’s gas tax, the first hike in nearly a decade.
The increase would bring the state’s per-gallon gas tax from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents, then raise it by 2% each year to account for inflation. 
At the same time, the state tax on diesel would go up three cents in July and another three cents two years later. That six cents would also get a 2% boost each year after that.
The gas tax hike, which would go into effect in July, is expected to raise $1.4 billion over the next six years. The diesel tax would net upward of $160 million over that time, estimates show. In total, lawmakers are banking on the package to bring in $3.2 billion over the next six years. 
Senate Bill 5801 contains numerous other tax and fee boosts. 
There’s an increase in the passenger vehicle weight fee. There’s a bump in the added sales tax for vehicles from 0.3% to 0.5%. There are $3 increases in the fees for titles and registrations. There’s a new 8% tax on the portion of the selling price of vehicles above $100,000. There’s a 10% tax on the amount of non-commercial aircraft sales above $500,000. There’s a temporary increase in the rental car tax from 5.9% to 11.9% before moving down to 9.9% in 2027.
There’s an increase in the tire replacement fee from $1 to $5. There’s a $1 increase every three years in fees for new IDs and driver’s licenses. And there’s an added charge for ferry riders paying with credit cards, as well as a 50-cent increase to the capital vessel surcharge on each fare.
House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, said the “dire” transportation budget situation warrants the potpourri of taxes. 
Lawmakers have warned of a $1 billion shortfall over the next two-year budget cycle, ballooning to $8 billion over the next six years. They point to skyrocketing construction costs, flagging gas tax revenue and the looming multibillion-dollar question of how to address the court-ordered removal of culverts blocking fish migration.
“My constituents don’t want to pay more, but they want to drive on roads that are well maintained,” said Rep. Julia Reed, D-Seattle. “They want to ride on ferries that function and run on time. They want to see their streets served by modes of transportation that allow them to get out of their cars once in a while, and allow their children to move around more freely.”
Republicans say the medley of taxes, on top of separate levies to pay for the operating budget, is too much for working-class residents to bear. 
Rep. Andrew Barkis, the leading Republican voice in the House on transportation issues, said in floor debate that he recognizes revenue is needed to improve Washington’s infrastructure.
But “it comes to a point where we’re putting this on the backs of Washingtonians with an ever-increasing burden of taxation,” said Barkis, of Olympia.
On the House floor, Democrats rejected Republican proposals to get rid of the increases to the gas and diesel taxes, rental car tax, vehicle sales tax and tire replacement fee.
Democrats did choose to ax a controversial $1-per-attendee tax on sporting events, concerts and more at large venues. To make up for the lost revenue, they added another increase to the fee on heavier passenger vehicles.
They also elected to require the state Department of Transportation to conduct an analysis before imposing tolls across the entire State Route 520 corridor, not just the floating bridge, as is currently the case. 
When the Senate approved its initial $3 billion revenue framework last month, four Republicans joined most Democrats in support. On Thursday night, the new version in the House passed 51-47 without any Republican votes and eight Democrats in opposition.
Senate Bill 5801 now goes to the Senate to agree with the changes made in the House before sending it to Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson’s desk by Sunday’s scheduled close of the legislative session. The chamber plans to take it up later Friday.
Ferguson has not publicly weighed in on the proposed gas tax increase.
“We’ll see when that comes to me,” Ferguson told reporters Friday, noting he was expecting a briefing from his budget director on the plan’s latest version.
How exactly the additional money will be spent remains to be seen. Lawmakers finished negotiating late Wednesday on their funding plan, expected to total upward of $15 billion. They plan to release their agreed proposal Saturday morning. 
Also on Thursday, the House approved transferring 0.1% of proceeds from the state sales tax from the operating budget to transportation starting in the 2027-29 biennium. This would shift hundreds of millions of dollars toward transportation.
The Senate on Friday also passed the bill, Senate Bill 5802, so it’s headed to the governor.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Interstate-5-Traffic-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-25 16:07:03.792823

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
Dugan-Crim-complaint
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
Gov. Tony Evers said the arrest was another example of the Trump administration’s attacks on the judiciary.
“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump Administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor,” he said. “I have deep respect for the rule of law, our nation’s judiciary, the importance of judges making decisions impartially without fear or favor, and the efforts of law enforcement to hold people accountable if they commit a crime. I will continue to put my faith in our justice system as this situation plays out in the court of law.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights. In recent weeks, the administration has attacked the integrity of our judicial system, refused to comply with a Supreme Court order, and arrested a judge for using her authority to protect the fair administration of justice.”

Senate Bill 50 requires cities and towns to change their election dates by in 2032. Morrisey signed the bill into law on Friday.
Supporters of the bill say requiring municipalities to have their elections along with state elections will save cities and towns money on election costs and lead to higher voter turnout. 
According to the West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office, 113 municipalities across the state will have their elections in 2025, which is not a year for state elections. 
Both bodies of the Legislature overwhelmingly supported the measure. Different versions of  the bill passed 96 to 2 in the House and unanimously in the Senate. Lawmakers ultimately approved the Senate’s version of the bill, which sets a deadline of 2032 for the cities to change their election days. The House’s version would have set the deadline at 2028.

“It is with a heavy heart that I must withdraw from consideration as chancellor of Montana Technological University, for circumstances beyond my control during these unprecedented times,” Marrongelle said in a statement.
Marrongelle was set to lead Montana Tech in Butte starting Aug. 4.
“Montana Tech is a special place, and I am deeply grateful to everyone in the Butte community who so warmly welcomed my family and me during our visit,” Marrongelle said. “Montana Tech deserves a great leader, and I am disappointed that it will not be me. I wish the faculty, students and staff nothing but the best as they continue their search for a Chancellor.”
The news release did not provide details, and MUS spokesperson Galen Hollenbaugh could not be immediately reached Friday for additional information.
UM President Seth Bodnar said he was disappointed Marrongelle would not be at the helm of the Butte campus with some 2,500 students. Montana Tech is connected to UM.
“Dr. Marrongelle is an exceptional and talented leader and would have been an outstanding chancellor for Montana Tech,” Bodnar said in a statement. “While we are disappointed that she won’t be joining the MT Tech community, we wish her every success.”
Marrongelle could not be immediately reached Friday through a message left with her office.

Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.

“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.

Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Get rid of FEMA? Trump-appointed group to look at shifting disaster response to states.

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)North Dakota is poised to be the first state in the nation to implement a law that provides legal protections for pesticide manufacturers — an issue that has been debated in legislatures across the country in the face of large payouts to cancer victims.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Wednesday signed House Bill 1318 that specifies that a label approved by the Environmental Protection Agency acts as sufficient warning to users about the hazards posed by pesticides and herbicides such as Roundup.
Georgia’s General Assembly passed its version of the pesticide protection bill but it has yet to be signed. The National Agricultural Law Center has been tracking the status of similar legislation in Iowa, Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wyoming.
Elizabeth Burns-Thompson is the executive director of the Modern Ag Alliance, a national group backing the legislation in North Dakota and other states.
“This law sets the standard for states across America to pass legislation similar to HB 1318 and, ultimately, stand up for our farmers,” Burns-Thompson said Thursday in a statement.
Ag groups have lined up behind the pesticide legislation, saying it ensures farmers will have access to chemicals they need to control weeds and insects.
Critics have said the bill will make it harder for people harmed by chemicals to win lawsuits against the manufacturers of chemicals.
 

Germany-based Bayer, maker of the popular herbicide Roundup, has been ordered to pay out billions of dollars to plaintiffs who claim the product has caused cancer.
The EPA has never determined that Roundup causes cancer. Plaintiffs have still prevailed, in part on the argument that they were not adequately warned.
Brigit Rollins, attorney for the National Agricultural Law Center, wrote earlier this year that almost every pesticide injury lawsuit filed in the past 10 years has included a claim that the pesticide manufacturer failed to warn the plaintiff of the health risks associated with the product.
Rollins was unavailable for comment Thursday, but wrote earlier this month that it was not clear how pesticide laws might affect pending lawsuits, which number in the thousands nationally.
Bayer’s website says it is also hopeful for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of laws such as the one being implemented in North Dakota.
A Bayer executive said in an April 14 Wall Street Journal article that the company may have to shut down U.S. production of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup.
The pesticide bill in North Dakota sailed through the House of Representatives, where it was introduced, passing unanimously in January. 
It faced more debate in the Senate, but was amended and returned to the House. A small group of protesters gathered outside the Capitol the day of the Senate vote, urging members to reject the bill.
Its second vote in the House was much closer, passing 51-40.
As the debate on the bill wrapping up, Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, said, “If we have learned anything, it is that we don’t know all the answers. We don’t know what this bill does.”
She noted that similar legislation has been pushed in other states.
“If it’s just a simple labeling bill, why did 35 other states vote it down?” she asked.
Leaders of North Dakota farm groups expressed their appreciation for the bill Thursday.
“This monumental step forward helps ensure our farmers have the certainty they need to make long-term planning decisions and stay productive in the field,” Justin Sherlock, president of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association said.
While the debate focused on Roundup, the law applies to other pesticides registered with the state Department of Agriculture.
The North Dakota law will take effect July 1. If signed, the Georgia law would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
Armstrong’s office declined to comment on his decision to sign the bill.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) A dispute over sewage disposal in a village outside of Santa Fe is leaking into the New Mexico Supreme Court, as residents contend state environmental agency actions surrounding a draft waste permit were unconstitutional.
Dozens of people gathered at blue cafeteria tables and the bleachers lining the Tesuque Elementary School gymnasium Wednesday night to hear the latest in the ongoing fracas over a permit for a leach field to dispose of treated wastewater from Bishop’s Lodge hotel and 82 adjacent homes in Tesuque Village.
Democratic Santa Fe elected officials also attended the town hall, including County Commissioner Justin Green in the room, and Rep. Andrea Romero and Sen. Peter Wirth virtually.
Tensions in the case have been building for the last year, as residents oppose multiple proposals for sewage disposal by the resort.
The meeting followed the latest development in the case: On April 22, attorneys for the nonprofit Protect Tesuque requested the state’s highest court order the New Mexico Environment Department to halt the permitting process for the hotel and homes, arguing in an emergency petition that the agency wrongly applied state environmental laws in the permitting process.
Specifically, they say the limitations in liquid waste laws should also apply to larger permits — dischargers disposing more than 5,000 gallons, which are regulated under another law.
State environmental regulators disagree.
“The New Mexico Environment Department maintains full confidence in its legal position that the Bishop’s Lodge wastewater treatment system falls under ground and surface water quality regulations,” said NMED spokesperson Jorge Estrada in a written statement. “NMED has consistently affirmed that the facility meets — or exceeds — all applicable state water quality standards.”
An administrative hearing officer on April 7 rejected Protect Tesuque’s request for the department to deny the permit.
Protect Tesuque’s argument to the state Supreme Court is that NMED’s permitting process for large dischargers ignores the regulations passed by the Legislature, and the agency doesn’t have the legal authority to make exceptions to those laws.
“NMED is making their own laws,” Hnakso told Source. “Their whole basis for doing what they’re doing is only applying the law if you’re discharging less than 5,000 gallons per day. If it’s more, they apply a different law — but that’s not what the Environmental Improvement Act says.”
He called it a separation of powers issue.
“The plain language is that the executive branch has to apply the law as written by the legislature,” Hnasko said. “If they don’t, it’s a constitutional violation.”
On Wednesday, attorneys for both NMED and Bishops Lodge filed court documents requesting that justices either dismiss the case or issue a schedule with deadlines for responses.
Thomas Hnasko, an attorney representing the nonprofit Protect Tesuque, in comments at the town hall to the approximate 60 attendees, said he was unsure if the state’s highest court would hear the emergency petition, and noted that the arguments had to contend with years of agency permitting.

“It’s a heavy lift because that’s the way it’s always been done,” Hnasko said. “It’s really difficult when you’re taking a position that’s gonna upset the apple cart and not only affect Tesuque, but have an effect statewide.”
But lawmakers, Hnasko said, could clarify which laws guide NMED’s permitting decisions.
“If changes need to be made or variances need to be applied for, that can happen in the Legislature,” he said. “But right now, the Environmental Improvement Act does not allow what they’re doing.”
Background on the dispute
Tesuque Village, with a little over 1,000 residents, depends mostly on septic tanks for sewage, and private wells for drinking water.
When Bishop’s Lodge’s 1970s-era wastewater treatment plant stopped working, the resort began trucking wastewater into Santa Fe for treatment, which the owners described as expensive and inefficient.
“Bishop’s Lodge and the Hills & Villas Community have worked closely with the New Mexico Environment Department Groundwater Quality Bureau to replace their old wastewater treatment system,” Chris Kaplan, the head of Asset Management at Juniper Capital, which owns Bishop’s Lodge, said in a written statement. “The new system, installed in 2024, is a state-of-the-art wastewater treatment facility designed to meet or exceed all local and national water quality standards.”
The resort changed its plans in response to community pushback, he added. “The original plan to release the fully treated effluent to surface water was abandoned in favor of an on-site, low-dosing area that will capture the fully treated effluent in the winter months.”
The current state permit authorizes Bishop’s Lodge to discharge about 14,700 gallons per day into two leach fields on the property. The new request would allow for discharge of up to 30,000 gallons of treated wastewater into a new leach field.

Protect Tesuque opposes the new disposal plan, writing on its website that the proposal fails to meet “engineering, siting, and contamination safeguards required by our state laws,” and pushes potential impacts downstream.
Residents Wednesday night expressed concerns about the costs of well testing and the potential loss of home values and safety if contamination occurred in the aquifer.
“I don’t want to have to spend $3,000 every year having my well tested test just to have somebody tell me they  screwed up my water and I lost, you know, a considerable value in the house and I won’t be able to sell,” resident Brian Corcoran said.
A week-long hearing on the draft permit is scheduled to start May 19.
‘You’re moving too slowly’
In Wednesday’s town hall, local officials suggested longer-term initiatives that could help address some of the issues at play.
For instance, Commissioner Green announced a plan to start engineering a regional water system that could move forward, after securing the final signature from the Pueblos of Tesque, Nambé, Pojuaque and San Ildefonso earlier that day. He said work on the study should begin in the next few months.
“That said, these things don’t happen very quickly. This is a large capital project, this will take years and years and years to do a lot of this groundwork,” he said.
Wirth agreed that ultimately the long-term solution must be developing a regional water and sewage system.
Residents said the solution isn’t fast enough.
“I’m sorry. But you’re moving too slowly,” said Donna Amos, a resident who lives near Shidoni Gallery, garnering applause from other attendees. “We will all be dead by the time a regional water system is done.”
Both Wirth and Romero, after multiple requests from audience members, committed to meeting with Juniper Capital representatives, but hesitated on further actions, such as introducing legislation, both saying it would be important to see if the state’s Supreme Court will weigh in on the issue.
After the town hall, Bernadette Romero-Jaramillo, a physical therapist and member of Protect Tesuque, said she believes the situation is no longer just a local fight, but one with statewide implications if the court takes up the case.
“Ours is a community that is here to fight to the bitter end to protect our village, our resources — it’s about our future,” she said. “We need a resolution for the now.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) In the absence of a new contract, Butler Hospital’s unionized workers are gearing up for a possible strike, union officials announced Friday morning.
About 90% of the members of SEIU 1199NE, the union representing about 800 positions at the Providence psychiatric hospital, voted to OK the strike. 
Butler Hospital frontline caregivers working without contract want more safety precautions

Because of vacancies in union roles, there are 704 union members now working at Butler. Of those members, 643 voted, with only six voting against the strike. The vote began on Monday and ended Thursday evening.  
A date has not been set for a strike as of Friday. Union members include professional and clerical staff, registered nurses, mental health workers, and housekeeping and dietary staff. All four SEIU 1119 contracts with Butler expired on March 31. 
“We are dealing with record numbers of assaults in the hospital and too many of us are afraid just to go to work,” Dan Camp, who works in behavioral health call intake at Butler, said in a statement Friday. “For the last month we have put forward specific proposals to improve workplace safety and the quality and consistency of care for our patients but management refuses to take our concerns seriously.” 
The vote comes four days after hundreds of Butler workers paraded up and down Blackstone Boulevard to protest wages and working conditions at the hospital, where SEIU 1199NE says the rate of assaults on workers increased 41% from 2022 through 2024.
“Low wages are the key reason staffing is so short and turnover is so high,” Camp continued. “We have Butler staff who are struggling to feed their family and even living out of their cars —- when people are worried about their basic needs it reduces the quality of the care and support we can provide.”
There were 108 open union positions at the hospital as of Friday. In the most recent contract, which expired March 31, mental health workers started at $18.27 an hour. Hourly wages for housekeeping and dietary staff started at $16.08, clerical workers started at $19.76, and professional staff and registered nurses started at $32.50 an hour. 
Raina C. Smith, a spokesperson for Butler’s parent company Care New England, responded to the news via email Friday afternoon.
“It is very disappointing that 1199SEIU asks its members to vote on a potential strike,” Smith wrote. “This is unnecessary and distracting, given that we are currently in active negotiations with a session planned for next week.” 
“Butler Hospital’s team is focused on reaching an agreement at the table, and we hope the union can focus its attention on the same goal,” Smith continued.
The hospital and the union will next meet at the bargaining table on Wednesday, April 29.

Tate Reeves vetoed the legislature’s certificate of need reform bill Thursday, arguing it unlawfully attempted to circumvent an ongoing court case by granting a certificate to a single psychiatric hospital in Jackson. 
The state’s law, which requires medical facilities to apply for a “certificate of need” from the Mississippi State Department of Health before opening or adding new services, aims to lower costs and increase the accessibility and quality of health care by avoiding duplication of services. 
A Senate amendment to the bill would have granted a new certificate of need to Oceans Behavioral Hospital Jackson and put to bed a legal dispute with Merit Health Central over the amount of charity care the hospital must provide. 
For-profit, Texas-based Oceans reopened St. Dominic’s Health’s shuttered mental health unit last year. 
Merit Health, which also operates a psychiatric unit in Jackson, sued Oceans last March, arguing it violated the law by using a workaround to skirt a health department requirement that it provide more free or low-cost care than it planned to in its application for a certificate of need. In the lawsuit, attorneys for Merit argued that Oceans not providing a sufficient level of charity care would have a “significant adverse effect” on Merit by diverting more low-income patients to its beds. 
“The proposed amendment smacks of both imprudent legislative favoritism towards the entity that will receive the CON, as well as bald prejudice to the other market participants,” Gov. Reeves wrote in his veto message. “In either case, awarding a CON by legislative fiat is bad public policy.”
Most of the bill was focused on making it easier for medical facilities to make capital improvements and require the University of Mississippi Medical Center seek state approval before opening educational facilities outside of Jackson. The final version of the bill also mandated that the health department study uncompensated care rates in psychiatric hospitals, such as the beds at the center of the Oceans lawsuit.
The governor said he would sign the bill if the carve-out for Oceans was removed.
In a statement to Mississippi Today, Oceans CEO Stuart Archer said his company remains committed to providing behavioral health care in the state.
“Oceans is fulfilling that commitment to the residents of Jackson and communities across Mississippi, and we will continue to fight for our hospital’s ability to provide care,” he said.
Rep. Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany and chair of the Public Health and Human Services committee and author of the House’s proposal, told Mississippi Today he was disappointed but not surprised by the governor’s veto. While he did not disapprove of the provision granting a certificate of need to Oceans, he suspected it might draw scrutiny from the governor. 
He said he has asked the governor to include certificate of need reform as a topic in his call for a special session to pass a bill this year.
“I think it’s very important for our rural hospitals especially to get this done now,” he said. 
The legal battle over care at the psychiatric unit housed at St. Dominic’s Health has now been ongoing for over a year. 
The state health department, which is tasked with overseeing the certificate of need process, recommended approval of Oceans’ application in December 2023, but said the hospital would have to provide 17% free or low-cost medical care to low-income individuals – more than the two percent it proposed in its application. 
But rather than adhere to the state’s stipulation for charity care, Oceans and St. Dominic’s filed for a change of ownership, bypassing the state’s requirement altogether and instead qualifying to open under St. Dominic’s existing certificate of need. 
Merit Health then sued Oceans, arguing that the change of ownership violated the state’s certificate of need law. St. Dominic’s and the State Department of Health are codefendants in the case. 
Earlier this month, a Hinds Chancery court judge ruled that Oceans’ change of ownership was legal, but that the health department exceeded its authority by not undergoing certificate of need review and ruled that the agency must complete the review within 120 days.
The health department appealed the case to the Supreme Court in March, requesting a stay. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. 
Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, chairman of Public Health and Welfare, introduced the Oceans-related amendment and said it, along with the requirement that UMMC seek state approval before opening educational facilities outside of Jackson, sought to develop and improve upon medical services in the capital city. 
On the Senate Floor, he also said it aimed to put an end to the legal battle. 
“There’s a lawsuit pending trying to say that the transfer was improper,” he said March 12. “The transfer was proper. What we hope to do with this is moot the lawsuit.”
A spokesperson for Merit Health said charity care provisions should be equitable to ensure hospitals can treat people with the greatest health needs. 
“We will continue to support changes to CON regulations that improve access to healthcare and reduce barriers to healthcare delivery for all providers,” she said.  
St. Dominic’s and the state health department declined to comment on the ongoing litigation. 
Certificate of need legislation shapeshifted over the course of the session. During the process, the Senate removed several key provisions of the bill originally approved by the House of Representatives, including those that would have streamlined the law’s appeals process and freed certain in-demand health care services – including substance use treatment and outpatient hospital dialysis units – from being required to acquire a “certificate of need” from the state to open.

Larry Rhoden announced Friday he’s seeking nominations for a new lawmaker to represent District 22 in eastern South Dakota after he appointed Sen. David Wheeler, R-Huron, to serve as a judge in the state’s Third Circuit.
District 22 includes Beadle, Spink and part of Clark counties. Wheeler was serving his third term as a state senator after he was first elected in 2020. He served as chair of the Senate Commerce and Energy Committee this session and vice chair of the Government Operations and Audit Committee and the State Affairs Committee. He was also a member of the Judiciary and Legislative Procedure committees.
Wheeler will replace retiring Judge Greg Stoltenburg. The Third Circuit consists of the counties of Beadle, Brookings, Clark, Codington, Deuel, Grant, Hamlin, Hand, Jerauld, Kingsbury, Lake, Miner, Moody and Sanborn.
“As a judge, it will be my job to apply the law fairly and equally,” Wheeler said in a news release, “without regard for politics or personal beliefs.”
Rhoden said he believes Wheeler will “represent the judicial branch with the same integrity, work ethic, and passion that he did in the Senate.”
Wheeler earned his bachelor’s, master’s and law degrees from the University of South Dakota before returning to his hometown of Huron. He is married with three children and a partner at the Blue, Wheeler and Banks law firm.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
Gov. Tony Evers said the arrest was another example of the Trump administration’s attacks on the judiciary.
“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump Administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor,” he said. “I have deep respect for the rule of law, our nation’s judiciary, the importance of judges making decisions impartially without fear or favor, and the efforts of law enforcement to hold people accountable if they commit a crime. I will continue to put my faith in our justice system as this situation plays out in the court of law.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights. In recent weeks, the administration has attacked the integrity of our judicial system, refused to comply with a Supreme Court order, and arrested a judge for using her authority to protect the fair administration of justice.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)You wouldn’t know there was an escalating global trade war by looking at Hasbro Inc.’s first-quarter balance sheet.
But the Pawtucket company’s $887 million first-quarter profit doesn’t reflect $100 million to $300 million revenue in losses projected for this year as a result of “reciprocal” tariffs with China and other key international manufacturing hubs for its products.
In an earnings call with investors Thursday morning, hours after Hasbro posted its first-quarter financial report, CEO Chris Cocks detailed the challenges that lie ahead for the toy and game empire under President Donald Trump’s current tariffs.
“Even with Hasbro’s relative strength and flexibility, logistics are becoming more complex and changes in receivables and shipping dynamics present a challenge,” Cocks said. “Ultimately, tariffs translate into higher consumer prices, potential job losses as we adjust to absorb increased costs, and reduced profits for our shareholders.”
There were no specifics shared on layoffs or price hikes.
Hasbro has accelerated a shift away from manufacturing in China — where 50% of its toys are made now — and intends to reduce its reliance on Chinese materials and labor to less than 40% of toys by 2026, Gina Goetter, Hasbro chief operating and financial officer, told investors during the call.
Other cost-cutting measures on the horizon include “source optimization” and “targeted pricing actions.” Together with potential layoffs and “prioritizing debt reduction,” Goetter estimated the company would see a net profit loss of $60 million to $180 million this year, mostly reflected in the second half of the year. The estimates are based on an existing 145% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods and a 10% tariff on goods from other countries.
No mention was made of Hasbro’s potential relocation to Massachusetts during the earnings call nor in the financial report. But costs associated with swapping its circa 1900 headquarters on Newport Avenue in Pawtucket for a piece of prime Boston-area real estate could be off the table as uncertainty roils the stock and bond markets.
Earlier this month, as Hasbro’s stocks plunged to a 52-week low, company executives postponed the headquarters announcement. Originally expected within the first three months of the year, Hasbro now expects to provide “clarity” on potential moving plans in the summer, Andrea Snyder, a company spokesperson, said previously.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not respond to inquiries for comment Friday, but said earlier this month the administration will “remain engaged” with Hasbro. The publicly traded international company first opened as a family-owned pencil box maker in Providence, and still employs roughly 1,000 workers in Rhode Island.
The economic roller coaster set off by Trump’s trade policies has not yet hit home for Hasbro, though. The company saw profits rise 17% compared with a year ago, boosted by a 46% increase in its digital gaming business, featuring Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons products.
Its digital gaming segment has been shielded from tariffs because its products are made in the U.S., or are digital, executives said.
The company has also not revised its guidance to investors on its annual performance.
“While we are dealing with a wide range of potential tariff, retailer and consumer outcomes, our games business and our strategic flexibility give us options,” Goetter told investors on the call.
Earnings per diluted share rose to 70 cents per share, up from 42 cents a year ago. Hasbro also saw stocks rebound slightly in the last 30 days. Shares opened at $61.84 Friday morning.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — As the Catawba Nation tries to double its police force, a bill adding the Native American tribe’s dedicated officers to the state police retirement system could help, officials for the tribe have said.
The bill, which passed the Senate unanimously but is awaiting a hearing in the House, would allow members of the police department to receive monthly pension payments after their retirement, based on their salary and years of service. All cities and counties in the state are allowed to opt into the system.
The Catawba Nation, which established its police department in 2023, has struggled to hire officers in large part because nearby law enforcement agencies, such as the York County Sheriff’s Department, offer better benefits, said Sen. Michael Johnson, the bill’s sponsor.
“They’re just simply asking to be allowed to join in so they can attract and, most importantly, retain law enforcement,” Johnson, R-Tega Cay, told a panel of senators.
Ideally, the department would have between 12 and 15 police officers, said Shawn Butler, head of public safety and chief of police for the tribe. The tribe hired its sixth officer earlier this month, but he still needs to go through training before he can officially start policing the reservation’s 4,200 people.
Allowing the Catawba Nation’s officers to join the state retirement system “is not only a matter of fairness but also a practical step toward strengthening law enforcement and public safety statewide,” Butler said in a statement.
A proposed casino in Santee won’t pass this year. But GOP-led bill shows new support for gambling.

“Ensuring equitable benefits for (Catawba Nation Tribal Police Department) officers will enhance recruitment, retention, morale, and inter-agency collaboration — all of which are essential for building safer and stronger communities,” Butler said.
In the past, the York County Sheriff’s Department handled any issues on the reservation. The state’s only federally recognized tribe still has an agreement with the sheriff’s department to help out as needed, though the goal is to become independent, said the tribe’s lobbyist, Jason Puhlasky.
If allowed to join the retirement system, Catawba Nation officers would contribute nearly 10% of their total pay, the same as every other police officer firefighter, and magistrate who participates. The retirement system allows retirees to start receiving benefits after working for 27 years or turning 55, so long as they meet the program’s requirements.
Because the nation’s police force is so small, the impact on the retirement system will be minimal, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.
“It would be like any other small town joining,” said Justin Werner, an attorney for the Public Employee Benefit Authority, which oversees retirement plans for the state.
Unlike other towns, cities and counties, the Catawba Nation would need legislative approval to join because of the tribe’s status as a sovereign nation.
Since 1993, the tribe has governed itself under an agreement with the state and federal governments. In joining the retirement system, the nation would have to follow the rules of the state retirement system or face enforcement actions.
Giving up any aspect of the tribe’s hard-won sovereignty is difficult, but tribe leaders felt it was worth the benefit of hiring more officers, Puhlasky said.
SC Native American tribes sign treaty promising to work together

The agreement is “a huge give, just so you know,” Puhlasky told legislators. “It comes with great trepidation.”
The same federal agreement that allowed the tribe to govern itself also gave it the power to create its own police department, though for years it lacked the resources. After the tribe’s Two Kings Casino opened in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, in 2021 — roughly 50 miles from the reservation — the revenue allowed the tribe to start hiring more officers.
Those officers, who work and live in South Carolina, won’t be involved with the casino over state lines, Puhlasky said. Security at the casino is handled through an agreement with the local sheriff’s department that allows the tribe to hire local deputies as security during their off-duty hours, he said.
As the police department grows, the tribe plans to build a permanent courtroom and police department, to be called the Catawba Nation Tribal Court and Peacemaking Center, on the reservation.
Early estimates put the cost of the roughly 12,000-square-foot building between $10 million and $12 million, Butler said. A Department of Justice grant will cover $1.6 million of that. But before the tribe can finish its own public safety center, it needs to know it can hire the officers to staff it, Puhlasky said.
“This is a big piece of how that would work,” Puhlasky said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-25-at-2.34.52-PM-1024x513.png,,,2025-04-25 15:22:56.444739

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Two vetoes by Gov. Kelly Armstrong stood up to challenges in the North Dakota Legislature on Friday. 
Armstrong vetoed Senate Bill 2307, a library obscenity bill, and House Bill 1540, that would have used taxpayer dollars to support private school tuition vouchers. 
A two-thirds majority was needed to override the vetoes.  
The library bill got fewer votes in the Senate on Friday than it had when the bill passed, despite the pleas of bill sponsor Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, and other supporters. 
Armstrong vetoed the private school funding but urged lawmakers to advance a broader school Education Savings Account bill. But that bill, Senate Bill 2400, failed in a House vote late Thursday. 
The tuition vouchers bill passed the House 49-43 on Monday. Friday’s attempt to override the veto in the House failed 48-45.
Lawmakers began the legislative session with five Education Savings Account bills, but none of the proposals remain under consideration.
