(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Multiple people were injured Sunday in downtown Boulder when a man reportedly lit them on fire, according to local police.
Six victims ranging in age from 67 to 88 years old were transported to hospitals in the region, police said. One was described as being in critical condition, with other victims’ injuries ranging from serious to minor.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Saliman, was taken into custody by police and was being treated for minor injuries at a hospital, Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Denver field office, said during a Sunday evening press conference.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” Michalek said.
The attack took place near the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall, an area in the heart of the city that typically attracts hundreds of people on the weekend. The first calls about the attack came at 1:26 p.m., Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said earlier Sunday.
“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”
Participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, were in the area at the time of the attack.
Michalek said the suspect was “heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.” He called it a “targeted act of violence” and said the FBI was investigating it as an act of terrorism.
Kash Patel, director of the FBI, earlier on Sunday called the incident a “targeted terror attack,” and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said it was a “heinous act of terror.”
The Anti-Defamation League said on social media it was “monitoring the situation in Colorado.”
Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the U.S. House, characterized the attack as targeting Jewish people.
“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon,” he said in a statement. “Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence.”
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, indicated the group was targeted.
“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,” Weiser said in a statement. “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado.”

Jeff Landry.,"Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, helped lead an effort to reduce funding in the state budget for a new private education voucher program that Gov. Jeff Landry has pushed. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The Republican-led Louisiana Senate Finance Committee has removed public money meant to expand the use of private education vouchers in spite of the initiative being a priority for fellow Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. 

The committee agreed Sunday to cut $50 million from LA GATOR, Landry’s initiative launching in the 2025-26 school year. The reduction will leave $44 million for the program, enough to continue covering private school tuition for 6,000 students who already receive state-funded vouchers. 
Landry and the Louisiana House wanted to put an additional $50 million into LA GATOR so the state could give out 5,300 new vouchers next school year, for approximately 11,300 overall. 
The cut was one of the biggest shakeups in the Senate leadership’s initial version of the $43 billion state budget unveiled Sunday. The Senate and House must come together to reach a compromise on the spending plan by June 12. 
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, has been resolute in his opposition to giving out more vouchers in the coming year. For weeks, he has expressed concern that LA GATOR’s cost could grow faster than the state can afford it, and that the state’s existing voucher program hasn’t resulted in better education outcomes for students enrolled in it.
Still, Landry and conservative groups who back LA GATOR have been putting pressure on senators to keep the $50 million in the program. They are running advertisements and recently held a rally next to the Capitol pushing for additional vouchers for the program.
Some senators were also reluctant to explain why the money had been removed Sunday. 
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Glen Womack, R-Harrisonburg, and Sen. Rick Edmonds, who sponsored the bill to set up LA GATOR last year, allowed the state budget bill with the cut to move forward, but they declined to comment after the committee meeting. 
Louisiana Education Superintendent Cade Brumley, one of LA GATOR’s biggest proponents, also refused to comment on the budget change after the committee hearing. Brumley said he had not had a chance to review the adjustment to the program yet. 
Yet based on the assumption that the number of vouchers offered would grow, Brumley had opened applications for the program across the state earlier this spring. Nearly 40,000 families have applied for the limited slots. 
At least some of the $50 million taken from LA GATOR is going to be used to restore $30 million to a targeted tutoring program for public elementary school students. Brumley attributed some of Louisiana’s success on national math and reading tests to the tutoring program and said he was grateful it had been added back into the budget. 
Landry, Senate hope for hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding 
The Republican Senate leadership’s version of the budget also adds hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to the state Medicaid budget. The money would be used to pay physicians and hospitals a higher reimbursement rate for treating Medicaid patients. 

Landry asked the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services earlier this year to allow Louisiana’s medical providers to receive a rate for treating Medicaid patients closer to what private insurers provide. 

The federal government has not agreed pay the new rate yet. But if it does, it will increase Louisiana’s federal Medicaid funding by $500 million in the state budget cycle that starts June 1. Hundreds of millions of federal  dollars could also be given to Louisiana to retroactively cover payments in the current budget year that ends June 30. 
Louisiana’s request for more Medicaid funding comes at a time when President Donald Trump and U.S. House Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, are pushing for ways to reduce the nation’s overall spending on Medicaid. But the reimbursement rates are not expected to be affected by changes Congress is considering. 
UNO transfer to LSU System comes with debt relief

The Senate has added $20 million in its budget proposal for the University of Louisiana System to pay off debt associated with the University of New Orleans, which is likely to move over to the LSU System this summer. 
The Senate has also included nearly $2 million for the UL System to continue a youth recreation partnership at UNO for another year and $450,000 for LSU to conduct an “academic and finance” audit of UNO in the next fiscal cycle. 

Sheriffs will get paid more to hold state inmates
The Senate added $11.6 million to the budget in order to give local sheriffs $3 more per day per inmate to house state adult inmates in their local jails. 

Currently, sheriffs are paid $26.39 per day per inmate to house state prisoners.
Louisiana keeps approximately 15,800 inmates in local parish jails instead of state prisons. This includes almost 2,000 state prisoners who are in transitional work programs, where they hold jobs at private businesses in the community while living at the jail. 
Louisiana DOGE gets money, staff to find efficiencies 

The Senate has added $1.5 million into the budget to support the so-called “Louisiana DOGE” initiative Landry set up to search for government efficiencies. The money will support 10 positions in Landry’s Division of Administration to perform a financial review of government services statewide.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Connick-1-1024x783.jpg,,,2025-06-01 20:02:32.828399

(Photos via Florida Senate and Florida House of Representatives)Florida legislators are finally heading back to Tallahassee to wrap up their work for the year.
Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez announced late Friday that closed-door negotiations had yielded a breakthrough on the state budget as legislative leaders agreed to a “framework” they will use to draw up a final budget bill.
The plan as outlined in memos to House and Senate members is for legislators to begin formal budget conference meetings on Tuesday with the goal of voting out a new budget for 2025-26 by June 16. Florida’s fiscal year starts on July 1.
The main job each year of the Florida Legislature is to pass an annual budget which authorizes billions in spending on education, healthcare, the environment, transportation, public safety, and more. The lingering standoff on the budget had led to the possibility of a state government shutdown 
While many details remain unclear, the deal announced on Friday would yield a substantial tax cut break for businesses versus a much smaller set of tax cuts for Florida families. The agreement does not include any consideration of a cut in the sales tax rate that had been championed by Perez and House Republicans.
Legislators left town in early May after failing to pass a budget during their 60-day session. On its final day, the House and Senate agreed to extend until June 6. At the time, Albritton and Perez announced an agreement to cut taxes by $2.8 billion, including a cut in the state’s sales tax.
But that deal fell apart after Gov. Ron DeSantis warned he’d veto it, lest it undercut his push to reduce property taxes. Albritton backed away from the earlier deal. That decision prompted sharp criticism from Perez, who said that Albritton had broken his word.
The new agreement calls for $2.25 billion in “revenue reductions” that include the elimination of the sales tax charged on commercial leases and business rent that is estimated to cost $900 million. 
The two sides also agreed to $350 million in “permanent sales tax exemptions targeted toward Florida families.” The memo did not explain exactly what exemptions, although the Senate previously had suggested eliminating some taxes charged on shoes and clothes.
The rest of the revenue reductions, however, would include $200 million for paying down existing state debt and $750 million that would eventually be placed in the Budget Stabilization Fund. The size of that “rainy day fund”  is now capped, so legislative leaders would ask voters in 2026 to approve raising that limit. In the meanwhile, they want to set aside money in reserves that will eventually go to the fund.

(Nadav Soroker/Searchlight New Mexico)
COUNSELOR, N.M. – On a Tuesday in March, Billton Werito drove his son Amari toward his house in Counselor, New Mexico, navigating the bumpy dirt road that winds through a maze of natural gas pipelines, wellheads and water tanks. Amari should have been in school, but a bout of nausea and a dull headache kept him from class.

“To me the surprise was certainly the magnitude of the effects” of air pollution on students, said Mike Gilraine, a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University. “It’s hard to find a similar factor that would have such an impact on schools nationwide.”

“It happens a lot,” Amari explained from the backseat, glancing up from his Nintendo Switch. The symptoms usually show up when the sixth-grader smells an odor of “rotten egg with propane” that rises from nearby natural gas wells and wafts over Lybrook Elementary School, where he and some 70 other Navajo students attend class. His little brother often misses school for the same reason.
“They just keep getting sick,” Amari’s father, Billton, said. “I have to take them out of class because of the headaches. Especially the younger one, he’s been throwing up and won’t eat.” The symptoms are putting the kids at risk of falling further behind in school.

Lybrook sits in the heart of New Mexico’s San Juan Basin, a major oil and gas deposit that, along with the Permian Basin in the state’s southeast, is supplying natural gas that meets much of the nation’s electricity demand.
The gas pulled from tens of thousands of wells in New Mexico has reaped huge benefits for the entire country. Natural gas has become a go-to fuel for power plants from coast to coast, sometimes replacing dirtier coal-fired plants and, by extension, improving air quality. Locally, oil and gas companies employ thousands of workers, often in areas with few other opportunities, all while boosting the state’s budget with billions in royalty payments.
But those benefits may come at a cost for thousands of students in New Mexico whose schools sit near oil and gas pipelines, wellheads and flare stacks. An Associated Press analysis of state and federal data found 694 oil and gas wells with new or active permits within a mile of a school in the state. This means that around 29,500 students in 74 schools and pre-schools potentially face exposure to noxious emissions, as extraction from the ground can release unhealthy fumes.
A measurable effect on students
At Lybrook, where Amari just finished sixth grade, fewer than 6 percent of students are proficient at math, and only a fifth meet state standards for science and reading proficiency.
Other factors could help explain students’ poor achievement. Poverty rates are higher in some areas with high levels of gas development, and students at rural schools overall tend to face challenges that can adversely affect academic performance. AP’s analysis found that two-thirds of the schools within a mile of an oil or gas well were low-income, and the population is around 24 percent Native American and 45 percent Hispanic.
But research has found that student learning is directly harmed by air pollution from fossil fuels — even when socioeconomic factors are taken into account.
And it’s not just New Mexico where this is a risk. An AP analysis of data from the Global Oil and Gas Extraction Tracker found over 1,000 public schools across 13 states that are within five miles of a major oil or gas field. Major fields are collections of wells that produce the highest amount of energy in a state.
“This kind of air pollution has a real, measurable effect on students,” said Mike Gilraine, a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, who studies connections between air quality and student performance.
In 2024, Gilraine cowrote a study showing that student test scores were closely associated with air contamination. Each measured increase in PM2.5, a type of pollution created from the burning of fossil fuels, was associated with a significant decline in student test scores, Gilraine found. Conversely, researchers have documented that reductions in air pollution have led to higher test scores and fewer absences.
“To me the surprise was certainly the magnitude of the effects” of air pollution on students, Gilraine said. “It’s hard to find a similar factor that would have such an impact on schools nationwide.”
America’s shift to natural gas has resulted in substantial increases in student achievement nationwide, Gilraine’s research shows, as it has displaced dirtier coal and led to cleaner air on the whole. But there has been little data on air quality across New Mexico, even as it has become one of the most productive states in the nation for natural gas. State regulators have installed only 20 permanent air monitors, most in areas without oil or gas production.

Independent researchers have extensively studied the air quality near schools in at least two locations in the state, however. One is Lybrook, which sits within a mile of 17 active oil and gas wells.
In 2024, scientists affiliated with Princeton and Northern Arizona universities conducted an air-monitoring study at the school, finding that levels of pollutants — including benzene, a cancer-causing byproduct of natural gas production that is particularly harmful to children — were spiking during school hours, to nearly double the levels known to cause chronic or acute health effects.
That research followed a 2021 health impact assessment that was done with support from several local nonprofits and foundations, which analyzed the effects of the area’s oil and gas development on residents.
The findings were startling: More than 90 percent of people surveyed suffered from sinus problems. Nosebleeds, shortness of breath and nausea were widespread. The report attributed the symptoms to the high levels of pollutants that researchers found — including, near Lybrook, hydrogen sulfide, a compound that gives off the sulfur smell that Amari Werito associated with his headaches.
Those studies helped confirm what many community members already knew, said Daniel Tso, a community leader who served on the committee that oversaw the 2021 health impact assessment.
“The children and the grandchildren need a safe homeland,” Tso said during an interview in March, standing outside a cluster of gas wells within a mile of Lybrook Elementary.

“You smell that?” he said, nodding towards a nearby wellhead, which smelled like propane. “That’s what the kids at the school are breathing in. I’ve had people visiting this area from New York. They spend five minutes here and say, ‘Hey, I got a headache.’ And the kids are what, six hours a day at the school breathing this?”
Lybrook school officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Despite risks, oil and gas can pump money into schools
Researchers have identified similar air quality problems in New Mexico’s southeast.
In 2023, a team of scientists from a coalition of universities conducted a detailed, yearlong study of the air in Loving, a small town in the Permian Basin. Local air quality, researchers found, was worse than in downtown Los Angeles, and the tested air contained the fifth-highest level of measured ozone contamination in the U.S.
The source of the ozone — a pollutant that’s especially hazardous to children — was the area’s network of gas wells and related infrastructure. Some of that infrastructure sits within a half-mile of a campus that houses Loving’s elementary, middle and high schools.
A small group of residents has spoken out about the area’s air quality, saying it has caused respiratory problems and other health issues. But for most locals, any concerns about pollution are outweighed by the industry’s economic benefits.
Representatives of the oil and gas industry have claimed the air quality studies themselves are not trustworthy.
“There needs to be a robust study to actually answer these questions,” said Andrea Felix, vice president of regulatory affairs for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA). Felix said other sources of emissions, such as cars and trucks, are likely a larger source of air quality problems near wells.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var a in e.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[“datawrapper-height”][a]+”px”}}}))}();
“Companies follow the best available science” for well placement and emissions controls, Felix said, and also contribute huge amounts of money to the state’s education budget through streams like royalties and direct expenditures. In the most recent fiscal year, oil and gas revenue supported $1.7 billion in K-12 spending in New Mexico, according to a NMOGA report.
Officials with Loving Municipal Schools are also skeptical of the alarm over the wells. Loving Superintendent Lee White said the school district used funds from the oil and gas industry to pay for a new wing at the elementary school, a science lab for students, turf on the sports field and training and professional development for teachers. He said the industry’s contributions to state coffers can’t be ignored.
“Are we willing to give that up because people say our air is not clean?” he said during an interview. “It’s just as clean as anywhere else.”
As White spoke, a drill rig worked a couple of miles east of Loving’s elementary school while parents poured into the gymnasium to watch kindergartners collect their diplomas. White touted the district’s success, saying the elementary school scores above state averages for reading, math and science proficiency, while Loving’s high school students far outpace the state average for college and career readiness.
But environmental groups, attorneys and residents continue to push for limits on drilling near schools.
Those efforts saw a boost in 2023, when New Mexico State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard issued an executive order prohibiting new oil and gas leases on state-owned land within a mile of schools.
Industry representatives decried the move, saying it added potentially insurmountable costs and barriers to drilling operators. However, AP’s analysis found that relatively few wells would be impacted even if the rule applied to all of New Mexico; only around 1 percent of oil and gas wells in the state are within a mile of a school.
In the years since, residents of areas where exploration is heavy have lobbied for legislation prohibiting gas operations within a mile of schools, regardless of land status. That bill died in committee during the most recent session of the New Mexico legislature.
Advocates have also sued the state over an alleged lack of pollution controls. That suit is currently pending in state court.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Nurses at Meriter hospital in Madison returned to work Sunday with a new contract at the end of a five-day strike, the first in the hospital’s history.
The agreement, reached Saturday and ratified by union members late Saturday night, for the first time gives nurses direct input on staffing concerns at the hospital, said Pat Raes, president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Wisconsin and also a nurse at the hospital. Raes spoke at a short return-to-work rally Sunday morning outside the hospital.
While it falls short of establishing guaranteed ratios of patients to nurses, Raes said the new two-year contract  establishes a precedent by including  language about staffing concerns.
Wages will go up by 10% over two years, Raes said. She said the wage gain offered “meaningful raises” including 8% across the board and the other 2% for “step increases recognizing our experience and attracting new talent.” 
Raes said the contract also contains  “enforceable language” addressing the safety of health care staff and patients, including a commitment to install a metal detector by the end of the summer.
Staffing concerns and a push for the hospital to guarantee specific ratios of patients to nurses on duty were among the issues that the union stressed in contract negotiations and during the five-day walkout.
In public statements during the contract talks and strike, UnityPoint Health-Meriter officials said they shared the union’s concerns for safe staffing levels but opposed dictating ratios, claiming it would hinder  flexibility to respond to changing conditions.
Raes said the agreement builds on an existing system of committees in which nurses are in charge. “We really felt that was the format for having the staffing discussions and noting where those issues were,” she said Sunday.
The contract also commits the hospital to an annual discussion with the union on staffing concerns and issues, Raes said.

“This was a long and difficult negotiation,” Raes said. “We acknowledge Meriter’s management for ultimately coming to the table and reaching an agreement that prioritizes the needs of our patients and our dedicated professionals. Today, we turn the page.”
The final negotiating sessions were conducted with the aid of a mediator from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC).
“We did not want to walk,” said bargaining committee member Carol Lemke, “but we felt it was the only thing we could do” to get staffing-related language in the contract.
In a statement distributed by UnityPoint Health-Meriter Saturday night after the agreement was announced, Sherry Casali, the hospital’s chief nursing officer, said, “We are grateful for the dedication and hard work of everyone involved in the negotiations. This tentative agreement represents meaningful progress toward a contract that recognizes the important contributions of our nurses.”
Raes said the union is now turning its attention to state legislation lawmakers have reported they are drafting that would establish a state mandate for the ratios of health care workers to patients in health care institutions. 
After five days of large throngs of picketing nurses, the crowd outside the hospital Sunday morning was smaller. The scene was cheerful and celebratory, accompanied by a sense of relief.
Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway turned out for the 6:30 a.m. return-to-work rally.
“I want to thank you for your courage because I know this wasn’t easy,” she told the nurses.
While she said she was grateful “mostly to the nurses,” Rhodes-Conway also said she was “grateful to management for coming to the table and finally understanding that we are stronger when we collaborate.”
The contract was ratified Saturday night by “a supermajority” of nurses, Raes said. Although the union didn’t release the official vote count, Raes said, “We had more people vote for this contract than we have ever had vote in the past.”
The union pushed to ensure the votes were cast and counted before midnight because the pay increases take effect with the start of the next pay period, Sunday morning.
The timing was also important for another reason. Meriter management told the union and employees that nurses on strike would be removed from the list of active employees effective Sunday, which would end their health insurance coverage.
The union wanted to complete the ratification process Saturday night “so there would not be any issues — there would not be any threat,” Raes said.
“We have nurses that are being treated for long-term health issues that cannot afford to lose their insurance who were out striking, and we have had other ones that felt they had to cross the picket line to not risk their health insurance,” Raes said.
She said she doesn’t expect divisions among members because of those choices, however. “Everybody, all the nurses, will continue to work together and have each other’s back on the floors,” Raes said, “because that is how we have to work.”
  Striking nurses left the message “We would rather be working!” in chalk on the sidewalk in front of Meriter hospital in Madison. The graffiti was still visible Sunday morning as the nurses returned to work. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)

Consumer advocates are raising alarms about the Trump administration's failure to publicize a major E. coli outbreak. (Photo by Getty Images)Colton George felt sick. The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletterInside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown, D-Ohio. “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
 The high cost of foodborne illnesses

Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas.
“This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak in peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
 ‘Life or death for our Sson’

E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”

Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.

Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.

After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.

For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

SPRINGFIELD – With public transit agencies in Chicagoland facing a fiscal cliff and the potential for thousands of layoffs, the state did not pass a bill that would have provided the agencies with potentially over $1 billion in new funding.

A version of the bill passed in the Senate, sponsored by Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago. But the House adjourned early Sunday morning without concurring as some of its tax hikes became too controversial. Now, the future of Chicagoland transit is in limbo as the bill awaits further action.

The Regional Transportation Authority — which oversees the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra commuter rail and Pace Suburban Bus — projects a $771 million annual operating budget shortfall.

At a hearing in the days leading up to adjournment, Amalgamated Transit Union political director Clem Balanoff told lawmakers that thousands of union bus drivers and train operators would be laid off if action wasn’t taken to fill the budget gap. RTA officials have estimated 40% service cuts are necessary to address the fiscal crisis.

Gov. JB Pritzker on Sunday said there is “significant work” left to address Chicagoland transit funding over the summer and into the fall.

“The fact is that we need to address transit funding as fast as possible,” Pritzker said.

The Senate’s proposal to do so included statewide taxes on deliveries and electric vehicle charging, as well as expanding taxes on rideshares and expanded certain Chicago taxes to the rest of Cook County and surrounding counties.

RTA and its subsidiary transit agencies will create their budgets for the upcoming fiscal year in the coming weeks. According to RTA spokesperson Tina Fassett Smith in a statement, those budgets “by law must only include funding we are confident the system will receive in 2026.”

“We think there’s probably a billion dollars for mass transit in there,” RTA Board Chairman Kirk Dillard said shortly after the Senate passed its transit bill late Saturday night.

Now, Dillard and other transit officials are going to work to minimize or avoid cuts.

“It’s clear that many in both the House and Senate support transit and our intention is to build on that shared support to identify the funding needed to avoid devastating cuts and disruption for everyone in Northeast Illinois,” Smith said in a statement.

The senate’s solution
House Bill 3438, the proposal approved by the Senate, would bail out transit authorities and send some funding outside northern Illinois. The reform package includes multiple tax increases. It’s unclear if any of these increases could come up again in future attempts to reform transit, although the House could pass it at a special legislative session or at a a future regular session.

The most controversial tax increase was a $1.50 fee added to any home delivery order placed online, with exceptions for some small businesses as well as orders containing only groceries and medication. Of the funds raised from this statewide tax, 80% would go to northern Illinois transit systems under a renamed RTA and 20% would be put into a fund for downstate transit agencies.

The bill would have also instituted a tax on real estate transfers in Cook County and the counties surrounding it. That tax is similar to one already in place in Chicago. It would have also required a charge on taxi and rideshare services in that region and a statewide 3 cents-per-kilowatt hour fee for charging electric vehicles.

""All told, we have achieved with the Senate package, a $1.5 billion investment for the northeast Illinois region,” Villivalam said. “And we have received more than double what downstate transit agencies requested for a historic investment.”

Over the two years that lawmakers have worked with the RTA on this transit funding issue, Democratic lawmakers have consistently repeated their mantra: there would be no funding without reform. To that end, they sought to institute sweeping reforms to the RTA.

The bill would rename the RTA to the Northern Illinois Transit Authority. The agency would have ultimate control over fares as well as a restructured board that places more power in the hands of the state.

While the bill will not become law soon, similar governance reforms were proposed by House lawmakers, who indicated there was agreement between the Senate and House on the reforms likely to be included in any deal.

Even still, those reform proposals drew fierce criticism from some suburban lawmakers

""This has become a bailout for Chicago CTA,” Sen. Seth Lewis, R- Bartlett, said. “We’re giving the mayor more control. We’re giving him more than a billion dollars in revenue.”

The board, under the Senate bill passed Saturday, would have five members appointed by the governor, five appointed by the president of the Cook County Board, five from the mayor of Chicago and one each from the collar counties.

In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.

Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
‘Wasteful grants’
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.

After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
Impact on communities nationwide
In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, Community-Based Public Safety Collective co-founder and CEO


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.

For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

The ink is hardly dry on Washington’s new budget and already legislative leaders are anticipating more fiscal uncertainty. 
Democrats are focused on threats to health care access if Congress slashes Medicaid funding, while Republicans are warning of renewed legal jeopardy in education funding.
In post-session interviews on TVW’s Inside Olympia, House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, warned that a U.S. House-passed budget legislation — if enacted — could force Washington into a special session to make emergency Medicaid adjustments.
“I’m very concerned about the prospects that Republicans in Congress are going to cut Medicaid at a level that’s going to lead to a whole lot of people losing health care around the country,” Fitzgibbon said. “We’re not able to insulate ourselves from that entirely.”
He said proposed reductions to federal reimbursement rates, particularly for hospitals and nursing homes, would force tough decisions. “We would have to come back in special session and we’d have to kick a lot of people off health care and close a lot of hospitals and nursing homes.”
Senate Republican Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, disputed that framing. “I think there’s a lot of fearmongering out there,” he said, adding that the U.S. House plan is “much more favorable for Washington than what many people thought.”
Braun pointed to proposed eligibility checks, work requirements, and reforms to prevent dual-state enrollment. “These are things that will not only save the federal government money,” he said. “They’ll save the state government money and allow us to deliver services more equitably to the people that really need it.”
 McCleary 2.0 concerns

The two party leaders also offered starkly contrasting assessments of whether the new state budget could reignite a constitutional challenge like the 2012 McCleary decision, which mandated that Washington fully fund basic education.
Fitzgibbon defended the budget’s approach, saying the state continues to increase total and per-student K–12 funding. “I don’t think that we are relying on local levies to make up the difference in what basic education costs,” he said. “Those are enrichment levies to cover additional programs.”
He argued that voters had already approved the levy increases and said the budget includes additional money for levy equalization, more formally known as Local Effort Assistance, or LEA, which provides extra state support to property-poor districts. “That should very much keep the scales balanced between the property-rich districts and the property-poor districts,” he said.
Braun disagreed sharply, warning that the Legislature’s move to increase local levy caps could trigger another legal challenge. “I don’t think there’s any question. I think you’ll have that lawsuit—if you don’t have it already—you’ll have it before the end of the year,” he said.
  Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, during an interview on TVW’s Inside Olympia. (Photo courtesy of TVW)
“You can’t go to a school district across our state and say, ‘Can you show me any definitive way that you’re not using levies for basic education?’ They’ll say, ‘No way, I can’t. We’re using it for basic education.’”
 Studies cite widening gaps

Outside groups are warning of persistent discrepancies among districts. According to a March 2024 report by the Washington State School Directors’ Association, wealthier school districts consistently raise significantly more revenue through local property tax levies, allowing them to offer expanded programs and staff. Lower-income districts often struggle to generate comparable funds, creating disparities in educational access and quality.
Though Washington law imposes a “levy lid” to limit how much local districts can raise, the system still allows for wide funding gaps. The League of Education Voters, in a summer 2024 analysis, concluded that the state’s LEA funding is “inadequate” to fully offset these disparities.
The report found that districts are increasingly using levies to fund what many parents and educators view as core services—including special education, student mental health, and additional classroom staff—undermining the notion that the state is fully funding a “basic education.” The result is what the League called “a patchwork system where access to a constitutionally guaranteed education can depend on a student’s ZIP code.”
Braun echoed that view, saying, “It’s undeniably inequitable. This will result in less money per student in some districts and more in others—and that’s exactly what McCleary said we could not do.”
Fitzgibbon acknowledged the concern but said it can be addressed legislatively. “The increase in levy equalization, which was not included in that bill, but is included in the budget, is something I have every expectation we’ll be able to put into statute.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Fitzgibbon-1-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-01 12:13:06.524700

The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletterInside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown, D-Ohio. “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
  The High Cost of Foodborne Illnesses 

Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas.
“This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak in peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
  ‘Life or Death for Our Son’ 

E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”
Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, and Karla Lems, R-Canton, speak to the press after they announced their campaign for governor and lieutenant governor at an event in Sioux Falls on April 24, 2025, at the Military Heritage Alliance. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Republicans could be choosing from a crowded field when they make their choice for governor in the 2026 primary. With as many as five candidates in the race, would-be governors will need to find a way to distinguish themselves from the pack. 
The first announced candidate for that race was Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, a Dell Rapids attorney. He declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in April. 
Hansen was the first candidate for governor to come from the new MAGA wing of the South Dakota Republican Party—referred to as “grassroots patriots” in his announcement speech. His campaign platform contains many of the topics his wing of the party has made a priority: cutting government spending, allowing school choice, protecting private property rights, opposing abortion and tightening election laws.
First candidate for governor focuses on property rights, spending and halting ‘corporate welfare’

Another topic that Hansen touched on was ending “corporate welfare.” That’s the name he has given to the practice of using taxpayer dollars to boost private business. His example of corporate welfare gone bad was Tru Shrimp. The company was given a $6.5 million loan of state and local funds six years ago to build a facility in Madison. While the company did manage to change its name to Iterro, it has yet to break ground. 
“I think it’s just unnecessary government mingling, and it’s risky business, and they’re wasting our taxpayer dollars to do it,” Hansen said in a South Dakota Searchlight story. “It’s the sort of stuff that we want to say ‘no more’ to. Let’s get back to the free market, low tax and low regulation.”
South Dakota got serious about using state dollars to entice and build business in 1987 when Gov. George Mickelson helped to create the Revolving Economic Development and Initiative Fund. Mickelson was able to convince the Legislature to implement a 1% sales tax increase that would sunset once it had raised $40 million for the REDI Fund. Since then the Governor’s Office of Economic Development has made loans and grants worth millions of dollars to new and existing businesses and industries in the state. 
Taking state government loans and grants out of the marketplace would certainly be one way Hansen could approach his new role if he were elected governor. That tactic, however, fails to consider the fact that a financial boost from the state is sometimes what it takes to get the free market interested in investing in South Dakota. 
Putting an end to low-interest government loans would certainly put the state at a disadvantage when it comes to competing with other states for business and industry.
A recent news release from the GOED showed just how invested the state has become in helping businesses grow. The news release noted a $3.4 million grant for the Big Stone Energy Storage Project thermal energy facility, a $2.6 million grant for a Bel Brands expansion and a $250,682 grant to Dakota Line Energy for a lagoon digester. 
The news release said the grants would result in $419 million in capital expenditures and create 180 full-time jobs. In essence, the state is betting $6 million in hopes of getting a $419 million payoff. That kind of “government mingling,” as Hansen called it, seems to offer pretty good odds. It is, however, as he noted, “risky business.”
At its heart, investing in economic development will always be a bit of a gamble. That’s why we expect government officials to place safe bets, though there is always the chance for a bust like Tru Shrimp. That’s the nature of any gamble.
Hansen won’t be the only “patriot” in the Republican primary for governor, with Aberdeen businessman and political influencer Toby Doeden also declaring his candidacy. If “corporate welfare” is going to be an issue in the GOP primary, the people who like to use state loans and grants to boost their local economies have got to do a better job of telling about the benefits of government investment. 
One way to do that would be to keep telling their story after the initial news release has been issued. Beyond the cliched photo of local officials with hardhats and shovels for a groundbreaking, taxpayers deserve regular updates on capital expenditures and job creation. This would add a layer of government transparency to the use of tax dollars. It would also soften the criticism from people like Hansen when an outfit like Tru Shrimp is slow to pay off on its state investment. 
Politicians often like to tout the benefits of the “free market.” By curtailing state grants and low-interest loans, that market will be free to invest in states that are more financially welcoming. 
In 1987, the state’s economy was badly in need of a jump-start, and it got one from Gov. Mickelson and the REDI Fund. Since then, that gamble has paid off more often than it’s gone bust. What Hansen calls “corporate welfare” has been a usually sound investment for South Dakota.

The Republican-controlled House passed two bills last week that would bar transgender girls from competing on girls sports teams. But Democrats, who control the Senate, say they will not consider the legislation.
“Our legislative agenda is long and attacking kids is not on it,” Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, a Democrat from Grand Rapids, told Chalkbeat in a statement.
Failure to take up the Republican-sponsored bills could draw unwelcome political attention to Michigan at a time when the Trump administration has targeted for investigation states that don’t comply with its view on Title IX, the federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on sex.
Since taking office for the second time, Trump has issued several executive orders targeting the rights of transgender Americans. One in January said the U.S. government would only recognize two genders, male and female, while another issued that month attempted to ban gender-affirming health care for transgender youth. A February executive order called for schools to block trans girls from competing on girls sports teams.
Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from schools that don’t comply with his executive orders.
Executive orders cannot override existing state and federal statutes, though, and there have been legal challenges to the constitutionality of Trump’s executive orders.
But the Trump administration’s threats to states that don’t comply with the order have stoked fears over how he intends to enforce it. Multiple federal agencies opened investigations into Maine this year after a heated exchange between Trump and the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, in which she promised to follow the state’s law protecting transgender rights.
In one of those federal cases, a judge issued an injunction to stop the government from freezing federal funds to the state. But there are two other open cases that have been assigned to the Department of Justice to enforce.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has said other states are at risk of losing federal funding for Title IX violations, specifically singling out California and Minnesota. Officials in those states have said their civil rights laws preclude them from complying with Trump’s executive order. Bondi’s office announced Wednesday that it has opened an investigation into California.
Like some other states, Michigan recently expanded state protections from discrimination on the basis of sexuality and gender identity and expression. The expansion of those protections two years ago has long been a signature issue for Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
She signed the expansion of the state’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act in 2023, saying in a statement that “Michigan is a place that will fight for your freedom to be yourself.”
It is possible what has happened in Maine could happen in Michigan, said Nancy Chi Cantalupo, associate professor of law at Wayne State University.
“But what is happening in Maine is in no way a success for the current administration at this point,” she said, noting that the federal government has never withdrawn funds from a state under Title IX or any other civil rights statutes it enforces.
“It’s not like there’s a light switch the federal government can use to just turn off federal funds at its whim,” she said. “There are a lot of steps it has to go through.”
Brinks did not respond to a question about whether she or others in the Democratic Party have concerns Michigan may be targeted by the Trump administration.
Whitmer’s office did not respond to questions about the bills.
In Michigan, a prohibition against trans girls competing on girls sports teams would affect few athletes statewide. The Michigan High School Athletic Association, the private organization that runs the state’s high school sports competitions, said there were no trans girls competing on spring sports teams this year. None played on winter sports teams, while two played on fall teams.
About 25 states have already passed similar laws restricting trans girls from playing on sports teams aligned with their gender identity.
Advocates for transgender rights say sports bills aren’t really about limiting the teams trans girls and women can play on.
“If this bill were just about sports, it wouldn’t be proposed in coordination with all of these other anti-trans bills [nationwide,]” said Kye Campbell-Fox, a research assistant and laboratory manager at Michigan State University, who studies the impact of legislation targeting the rights of trans kids. “This is a coordinated campaign to push trans people out of public life.”
 Advocates say trans youth don’t feel safe as their rights are attacked

Though the Michigan bills have effectively died, advocates say lawmakers’ focus on the issue — and the language they often use to talk about trans athletes — is still harmful to all trans children.
The Michigan bills, for example, referred to trans girls as “biological males,” ignoring their gender identities. And some lawmakers have said that the presence of trans girls in locker rooms could lead to sexual violence against other girls.
Rep. Mike Harris, a Republican from Waterford, said during a hearing for the bills that he was concerned about the potential for sexual assault if trans girls use girls locker rooms.
“I don’t think it’s appropriate to place biological boys and girls in the same room, to strip down naked next to each other,” he said.
There is no evidence to support the idea that trans girls will assault other girls, though there is evidence that trans populations face increased risks when they use bathrooms according to the sex they were assigned at birth.
Republican lawmakers’ rhetoric has emboldened some students and adults to feel freer to make hateful remarks, and LGBTQ+ youth are being affected by it.
“I’m hearing a lot of fear from youth,” said Jude Krajnyák, a regional coordinator for a research policy project at the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health. “Things everyone else gets to take for granted — like playing soccer in middle school — are rights that are being taken away from us.”
Krajnyák said he heard from a trans girl in middle school who gave up on playing soccer because she said “it’s just not worth” the backlash.
Currently, the Michigan High School Athletic Association determines eligibility for trans girls to play on girls teams on a case-by-case basis. The executive director of the association, Mark Uyl, makes the determination based on a number of factors, including what gender is recorded on the students’ school documents and other paperwork. Students are also asked whether they’ve begun hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries.
“The MHSAA asks for documentation on therapy and surgery as our policy allows for a waiver to be both approved and denied — and part of that decision is based on where in the transitioning process a student is at the time,” Geoff Kimmerly, director of communications for the association, told Chalkbeat.
The policy went into effect in 2012, according to the association. It aligned with federal law during the Obama administration, as well as federal requirements from the Office for Civil Rights during Trump’s first term and Biden’s presidency.
“The MHSAA follows and will continue to follow all applicable state and federal laws,” said Kimmerly in a statement. “We are monitoring developments in this regard closely.”

This policy change would replicate how the government resolved the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s -- by negotiating steep discounts from the bank lenders, which allowed countries to repay much lower amounts, restoring their credit ratings. We should borrow from that experience. 
The post Here’s how we can help solve the student loan crisis: sell th[...]","FROM THE ONSET of the pandemic until today, the terms of federal student loan repayment have changed over and over again. It is often forgotten that President Trump was the first to pause payments through the CARES Act, signed in March 2020. But it was President Biden who tried to put a stake in the heart of student debt, forgiving most of it only to see the Supreme Court deny him the right to do so.  In his second term, President Trump has concluded that it’s time to collect on the debt. The administration announced in early May that it is resuming aggressive collections on defaulted federal student loans. The government is threatening to garnish wages, tax refunds, and Social Security benefits from those who fail to pay.  For many borrowers, it will feel like being flogged while already down. Defaults are expected to balloon. This isn’t about individual irresponsibility. It’s about a broken promise — that student debt would pay for itself through higher earnings. For millions, it hasn’t. And it never will. Is there any escape from what is broadly seen as a failed policy? Here’s an idea that would be a win-win for government and student loan holders: Sell the debt before it becomes an even bigger problem.   Student debt operates under a fundamentally different set of rules than most other types of debt—a fact that often goes overlooked. Federal student loans are not traded in financial markets and are not “marked to market” like corporate or sovereign debt. In fact, by law the government can only trade the debt if it involves no loss, a condition which has effectively prohibited any trading. This means the value of student loans remains on the government’s books at face value, even when long-term repayment is unlikely — due to defaults — or delayed through income-driven repayment, deferments, or forgiveness programs. Thus, a first step toward a sale of the debt would be to recognize that the $1.6 trillion in student debt sitting on the federal government’s books is worth much less due to growing defaults. Only by shining the light of the market on it will we learn the real value of the debt.  Sales of debt into the market may involve painful discounts. But this will force transparency. After the sale, students would pay the discounted price, which would represent real debt relief.  In size and method, this policy change would replicate how the government resolved the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s — by negotiating steep discounts from the bank lenders, which allowed countries to repay much lower amounts, restoring their credit ratings. The combination of the government working with the private sector succeeded in lifting the entire region from depression and despondency. We can borrow from this experience. Before a debt sale the government must set terms with prospective buyers that whatever discount is achieved in sales will favor the student borrower. Thus, if a bank buys a lot of debt at a 50 percent discount it will mean that the debt of the student borrower will be cut in half.  The bank will benefit from the ability of the student to keep up with lower payments. Right now, the credit ratings of students are in the cellar. Cutting the debt load on students would raise these ratings, making them better able to participate in the market for houses, cars, and other big-ticket items.   Meanwhile, debt sales would provide substantial cash to the government that could be used to provide student grants, pay down national debt, or meet any number of priorities. To maintain the status quo would keep the government in the collection business forever given the $1.6 trillion of debt, which will only grow over time.  If this effort were running smoothly, it would be one thing. But the government has wrapped itself into a pretzel trying to meet its fiduciary obligations to taxpayers while easing burdens on students. Meanwhile, the servicing companies it contracted to collect the debt infuriate students with false information, incorrect payment demands, and overall poor communication.  Selling the debt would free politicians from the trap of having to compel payments from those they seek votes from. It would also alleviate distortions, including how the easy availability of loans has allowed colleges to raise tuition levels to stratospheric levels. To end the scourge of student debt, the government must not only sell existing debt but also ease up on lending. Even with declining enrollments the government annually issues $70 billion in new loans and $40 billion in new Pell grants. These figures should be reversed, and new loans should be ready for sale.  At present, student loan rates are high at 6.5 percent for undergraduates and 8 percent for graduate loans, sufficiently attractive for banks to purchase. Any attempt by banks to cherry-pick the loans of students with the highest credit scores should be forestalled by offering discounts on the loans of low-income students. States are showing a much better way of financing higher education by offering cheaper options such as community colleges and vocational training. State grants combined with federal Pell grants often allow students to attend these programs for free. They are directing colleges to limit tuition and other costs to what can be covered by grants.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration is imposing stricter conditions on Pell grants, which could greatly narrow their availability. Lack of access to Pell grants will put pressure on student finances, forcing them to borrow more. The government should do just the opposite — increasing grants while decreasing loans. All of these changes should be voted on by Congress. We learned during the Biden administration that trying to use executive action to implement sweeping change will only lead to court action and political rancor.  President Trump has shrunk the federal government in ways that have cut vital services in many areas. Lessening its role in the student loan business would actually be a good way to reduce government’s footprint. Bob Hildreth is a former International Monetary Fund economist whose professional work involved restructuring Latin American debt and marketing sovereign debt loans. He is the founder of Boston-based Hildreth Institute, Inversant, and other nonprofit organizations with complementary missions to help get low-income students to college.  The post Here’s how we can help solve the student loan crisis: sell the debt    appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/massbay-e1707743859561-edited.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-01 09:01:12.626320

The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned Alabama’s ban on the NAACP, allowing the NAACP to operate in the state for the first time in eight years. 
NAACP leader Ruby Hurley set up the office in Birmingham in 1951, only to be forced to flee the state five years later after Alabama authorities aggressively investigated the NAACP and tried to seize membership records. 
After the NAACP refused, an Alabama judge levied a fine against the organization and threatened more penalties it refused to comply. The NAACP sued, only to have the Alabama Supreme Court dismiss the litigation. NAACP lawyers argued that the release of such records could invite reprisals and attacks on their members. 
In 1958, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the right of association and assembly under the First Amendment is protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. If the high court had upheld the state’s attempts to seize membership records, it would have dealt a serious blow to the organization, its members and the movement itself.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06104623/Ruby-Hurley-June1-FeatImage.jpg,,,2025-06-01 09:01:12.626320

Every day we delay, more kids are being hurt.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont state legislators: Big Tech doesn’t want you to know what’s happening to your kids online. We do..","This commentary is by 17 Vermont state legislators. Their names are listed below the text of the commentary.There’s a battle happening over your child’s safety — and most Vermonters have no idea it’s underway. That’s because it’s being waged behind closed doors: not in press conferences or public hearings, but in whispered conversations, anonymous letters and legal threats from some of the most powerful corporations in the world.As Vermont state legislators and sponsors of the Vermont Kids Code (S.69) — also known as the Age-Appropriate Design Code — we’ve been on the frontlines of this fight. We want to share what we’ve seen, what’s really at stake, and why we need Vermonters to stand up and speak out before it’s too late.S.69 is a common-sense bill designed to protect children online. It prohibits manipulative features like autoplay and endless scroll for minors. It prevents companies from making programming decisions designed to addict and exploit. It defaults to strong privacy settings. And it says that if a company knows that its product is being used by a kid, they have a duty to protect them — not exploit them.But Big Tech doesn’t want that.Your child’s attention is money. Their data is money. Their mental health? Their safety? That’s just collateral damage.So the moment this bill started moving, the industry mobilized. But they didn’t show up themselves — not Meta, not Snap, not TikTok, not Google.Instead, they deployed front groups — organizations with friendly sounding names like NetChoice and TechNet, funded by Big Tech but designed to appear neutral. These groups flooded lawmakers with memos filled with legal jargon and exaggerated fears of censorship.Big Tech refused to testify in public. And their front groups? They didn’t come out of the gate disclosing who they represent. And not once — not once — did they mention the stories of children whose lives have been destroyed by the very systems we’re trying to regulate.They didn’t talk about the 12-year-old Vermont girl who was allegedly raped by a man Snapchat recommended as a friend she might know.They didn’t talk about the students whose bodies were found after months of algorithm-fueled self-harm and depression.They didn’t talk about the parents who wake up every morning knowing their child will never come home again — because a multibillion-dollar company couldn’t be bothered to turn off a notification.Instead, they told us our bill might be “too hard” to comply with.That’s not a legal argument. That’s a business model problem.The truth is, we built this bill to withstand court scrutiny. We studied rulings in other states. We tailored the language. We removed any provision that regulated speech and focused only on product design and data processing. We listened to civil liberties groups, constitutional scholars and children’s advocates. We did the work. Because that’s our job.The opposition? They’re doing theirs too — but their job is to protect profit.These conflicting goals create a difficult fight. If we walked away from every hard fight, no child would wear a seatbelt. No parent would know if a toy was toxic. This is how progress happens. You write the strongest law you can, and then you defend it — because the cost of doing nothing is simply too high.And here’s what keeps us up at night: every day we delay, more kids are being hurt.More are being addicted. More are being preyed upon. More are falling victim to a system designed to exploit them.The 2025 S.69 Age-Appropriate Design Code passed the Vermont Senate on a vote of 25–5 and the Vermont House on a vote of 133–9 with strong tri-partisan support. The Legislature is expected to continue moving the bill forward and eventually send it to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk.If you are a parent, a grandparent, an educator or a young person tired of being treated like a product — you have a role to play.Contact the governor’s office today. Ask him to stand with Vermont families — not with the powerful out-of-state corporations working behind the scenes to stop this bill.Because this is the industry playbook. Meta, Snap, TikTok and Google profit from addicting and exploiting children — and when lawmakers push back, they send in front groups to confuse, delay and weaken the response.Gov. Scott has an opportunity to rise above their tactics and lead.We may not have their billions. But we have the truth. And the truth is, this bill will save lives.Let’s make sure the governor hears from Vermonters — not just Silicon Valley. Let’s show our kids that when it mattered, we stood up for them.Rep.

People just kept recognizing Russell Porter’s genius and offering him jobs.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Art, Architecture, Astronomy and the Arctic — A Vermonter’s curious career.","Russell Porter couldn’t get enough of adventures in frigid climes, participating in nine Arctic and sub-Arctic expeditions. Photo via National ArchivesIf Russell Porter ever wrote a resume, recipients could be forgiven if they thought someone was playing a joke on them. At various times, he was an artist, but also an engineer. An architect, but also a cartographer. He was a builder, and a death-defying arctic explorer, while also being a ground-breaking telescope designer.In truth, Porter might never have had to write a resume and make sense of all this nonlinear bouncing between vocations and avocations. Resumes weren’t mandatory in the job market during the first half of the 20th century. More importantly, he didn’t seem to need one, because people just kept recognizing his genius and offering him jobs. Here’s some of what his resume might have covered: Born in Springfield, Vermont, in 1871. Took college preparatory classes at Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, from which he graduated. Skipped freshman year of college, enrolling as a sophomore at Norwich University before transferring to the University of Vermont to study engineering. Left UVM before graduating when his family suffered a financial blow.Moved to Boston, where he took a job appraising buildings for an insurance company. Became so fascinated with the buildings’ designs that he decided he would become an architect. Enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study architecture, while still working part time as an appraiser to pay his bills.That’s when his career took its first surprising zag. In the fall of 1892, Porter attended a lecture by arctic explorer Robert Peary about his recent traverse of northern Greenland, which confirmed that it was indeed an island. Porter was transfixed by one thought — he had to join Peary’s team. As he explained, “Out of a clear sky that evening came to me the undefinable lure known as arctic fever.” Porter managed to secure an interview with Peary that winter in Washington. The conversation went well; Peary agreed to consider Porter for his next expedition.But Peary ultimately decided against taking Porter. Only years later did Porter learn that his mother had written the explorer, imploring him not to take her son.Russell Porter as a young man. Photo via Stellafane
The following year, Dr. Frederick Cook, who had been a member of Peary’s Greenland expedition, offered to take passengers to the Arctic for a fee of $500. Porter, who had studied painting under an accomplished MIT classmate and surveying in a college course, persuaded Cook to reduce the fee to $300. In exchange, Porter would serve as the group’s artist and surveyor. Apparently Porter’s mother didn’t object. Porter took leave from his job — he was working as an architectural draftsman by then — and voyaged north with Cook and 50 other paying passengers aboard a steamship. The Miranda attracted mishaps like a magnet. Departing the pier in New York City, the ship’s crew accidentally rammed the dock instead of backing out into the Hudson. En route to Greenland, the Miranda struck an iceberg. The ship stayed afloat, but needed repairs. Underway again, the Miranda struck an uncharted submerged reef, tearing a gash in its hull. The shriek of shredding metal filled the vessel. “I had for the first time been thoroughly frightened,” Porter wrote, referring to it as “tasting copper,” a sensation akin to what “one feels when placing upon the tongue certain electrodes that will generate a slight current.”The Miranda was beyond repair. Porter was one of a dozen men, including four Inuit guides, who boarded a sailboat to search for help. Sailing 150 miles north, crossing the Arctic Circle, the men located an American fishing schooner, the Rigel, which agreed to help. Once everyone had transferred from the Miranda onto the Rigel, the cable securing the Miranda was cast off and the stricken vessel steamed off into a fog bank, never to be seen again. Despite the dangers he’d faced, Porter was eager to return to the Arctic. He found the “fugitive glimpses of the shimmering ice cap” irresistible. Porter spent the next decade splitting time between Boston and expeditions in the frozen north. MIT gave Porter a scholarship to pursue postgraduate studies, even though he had never graduated college. But his mind was equally occupied with thoughts of the next expedition. When visiting Vermont in wintertime, he made a habit of getting off the train in Bellows Falls and walking the dozen miles to his family’s home to acclimate to the cold. In all, he would make another eight treks into the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.Porter persuaded Peary to take him on an expedition hunting a large meteorite that had smashed into Greenland. Porter joined a small scientific team stationed in Umanak, a Danish settlement north of the Arctic Circle, where he oversaw the group’s food and camping equipment. In his free time, Porter helped the scientists monitor the movement of a nearby glacier. Peary didn’t find the meteorite, but Porter returned to Boston with watercolor portraits he had made of members of the local Inuit community. Porter rejoined Peary the next summer as he tried again to find the meteorite; this time, thanks to the help of Inuit guides, Peary was successful.After trying his luck in the Klondike gold rush in British Columbia, Porter joined the Baldwin-Ziegler Polar Expedition of 1901 as a surveyor and artist. The latter job almost got him killed. While sketching the shoreline one day, Porter became so engrossed in his work that he didn’t notice a large white bear approaching until it was about 100 feet away. The polar bear was already well aware of Porter, who was alone and about three miles from camp. Porter carried a rifle for just such an event. Aiming the gun at the bear, he pulled the trigger. The hammer moved as if in slow motion and came to rest gently on the firing pin. The gun’s oil had congealed in the frigid conditions. Porter dropped the gun, pulled out his knife and began shouting and dancing about. The display only made the bear more curious. Porter tasted copper for the second time in his life. In desperation, he whacked the gun over his knee in hopes of bringing it back to life, then raised the rifle again. This time it worked.Although the Baldwin-Ziegler Polar Expedition never lived up to its name — it never reached the North Pole — Porter returned to Boston impatient for his next chance. He signed on almost immediately with the Fiala-Ziegler Expedition, this time as artist, surveyor and assistant scientist. This expedition would be the most trying he endured.The America steams north of the Arctic Circle in this painting by Russell Porter. Photo via National ArchivesDuring the summer of 1903, Porter traveled to Russia, joining the expedition’s vessel, the America, and the rest of the crew in the far northern White Sea. While Porter and most of the men were camped on the northernmost island of the Franz Josef Archipelago, the America disappeared from its mooring one night during a heavy storm. Two days later, the men aboard the America managed to sail back to the bay, explaining that the ship had been blown out to sea. Things didn’t improve from there. In November, the America became trapped in the ice. The men salvaged goods from the ship and stripped every useful part before the America sank during a January storm. Subjected to cold and living off rationed food, the men split into feuding factions. To distract the men during the long, cold days, Porter fashioned a deck of playing cards from sheets of zinc, using his watercolors to paint the faces. The deck was four inches thick and weighed two pounds. His more serious task was taking celestial bearings to determine the location of their camp. While stranded, expedition leader Anthony Fiala made several attempts to reach the North Pole, selecting Porter as part of the team. But each effort failed. A relief ship finally rescued the men in the summer of 1905, after two years marooned above the Arctic Circle. After nine Arctic and sub-Arctic adventures, Porter decided at the age of 34 that it was time for a less perilous existence. His dream was now to start an art colony in Maine. He started by purchasing a house and 50 acres in Port Clyde from a fisherman. He soon married the fisherman’s daughter, Alice Belle Marshall. A few years later, the couple became parents to their daughter, Caroline.Crewmembers salvaged everything they could from the America after it was trapped in the ice. Photo via National ArchivesIf Port Clyde provided a fruitful place to start a family, his idea of forming an art colony there failed to take root. Porter shifted his attention to farming potatoes, like his neighbors, but only briefly. He moved on to something relevant to his actual training; he designed and built cottages to rent out, creating 14 unique designs for the houses, all done in a rustic English style. The next turning point in Porter’s life arrived in the mail. An old friend from Springfield, James Hartness, knowing that Porter was captivated by the cosmos during his years of Arctic navigation, sent him a copy of Popular Astronomy magazine. Porter’s celestial obsession dovetailed perfectly with the part of his brain that loved the challenges of engineering. Soon he was constructing telescopes, meticulously making his own mirrors, and building a small, domed observatory next to his home.Hartness, who had become wealthy as president of the Jones and Lamson Machine Company, mailed his friend $200 to support his telescope-building endeavors. He even gave Porter his decrepit Stevens Duryea automobile. The thing didn’t run, but no matter: its true value was providing parts for building telescopes. In Porter, Hartness had found a kindred spirit: the two corresponded regularly about telescope designs.Porter was on the move again in 1915, relocating to Boston with Alice and Caroline to teach architecture at MIT, a testament to his lived experience since he himself had never graduated. Soon, however, with World War I raging, Hartness, a leader in the machine tool industry, convinced officials with the National Bureau of Standards that Porter would be invaluable in Washington to solve issues producing enough optical instruments for the war effort.When the war ended, Hartness persuaded Porter to return to Springfield to help him develop an optical device to inspect screws for uniformity. It was less inspiring than spending nights gazing out through the Milky Way, but it paid the bills. Porter’s biographer, Berton C. Willard, wrote that Porter wasn’t “a joiner,” or “socially or civically minded.” But he was far from a hermit, and in fact Porter’s time in Springfield seems to contradict that characterization.In August 1920, Porter assembled a group of 16 men and one woman to teach them how to build telescopes, particularly the painstaking work of grinding and polishing mirrors by hand. Out of this first meeting of friends with a shared passion grew the Springfield Telescope Makers. Club members built a gathering place on a nearby hill owned by Porter, who naturally oversaw construction. He suggested they name it Stellar Fane, from the Latin for “shrine to the stars,” soon shortened to Stellafane. The group has held nearly annual gatherings since 1926, making it the longest-running astronomical convention in the United States. The founding members of the Springfield Telescope Makers club gather in 1920. Russell Porter is fourth from left. Photo via StellafaneGiven Porter’s unique combination of talents, it wasn’t hard to surprise his friends. Stellafane member Ralph Flanders, a manager at Jones and Lamson and a future U.S. senator, recalled an incident during a backcountry trip with Porter in Quebec. One night, while camped in a farmer’s field, Flanders asked Porter where exactly they were. “I’ll tell you,” Porter replied, taking out a saucer and pouring in maple syrup from their food supply, then balancing it on their car’s fender. Sighting the North Star with his sextant and bringing its image together with its reflection on the syrup, which acted as an artificial horizon in place of the sea’s horizon, he was able to calculate their latitude. Then, using the sextant, his wristwatch, and tables from his copy of The Nautical Almanac, along with the maple horizon, he determined their longitude. Scrawling the coordinates on a piece of paper, he said, “That’s where we are.” In 1925, Albert Ingalls, an editor at Scientific American magazine, visited Stellafane and came away impressed. His article about the club elicited enthusiastic letters to the editor from readers as far away as Alaska, Argentina, Australia, India, and Switzerland, demonstrating that amateur telescope building was becoming a global pastime. Porter became a leading figure in the hobby, writing regular pieces for Scientific American and other publications.Among his readers was George Ellery Hale, a prominent American astrophysicist who dreamed of building the world’s largest telescope. Ingalls arranged a dinner with Porter and Hale in New York City in early 1928 at which Porter spoke expertly about how Hale could realize his dream. Grabbing any paper that came to hand, he sketched out his ideas. Later that year, a pair of astronomers arrived in Springfield to speak with Porter. Not realizing who they were, Porter talked about a wide range of topics — the Arctic, art, life in Vermont. They might have skipped the topic of astronomy completely. Only when the men had left did Porter learn that Hale had sent them, and that he’d just been interviewed for a job. Apparently, it had gone well. Some weeks later, Hale telegraphed Porter: “Can you come to Pasadena for several months to assist in designing a 200-inch telescope.” Hale hoped Porter could “come at once to push work rapidly.”That telegram set the course for the final two decades of Porter’s life. Porter proved himself an invaluable addition to the team from California Institute of Technology building the massive telescope. With a mirror measuring 200 inches across, Hale’s telescope would be twice the size of the next largest in existence.Porter was initially assigned to design a specialized telescope to test the suitability of various sites around the Southwest. The team ultimately picked Palomar Mountain, southeast of Pasadena, as the location of the future observatory.Next, Porter designed a series of large Art Deco-style office and laboratory buildings. He also designed the mounting for the telescope, monitored manufacturing of the enormous mirror and devised the massive rotatable dome that would cover the telescope. One of his greatest contributions to the project, however, was creating masterful cutaway drawings that showed how parts that hadn’t yet been fabricated would interact. His drawings were credited with resolving heated debates within the team.“(T)o think that any artist had his pictorial imagination in such working order as to construct these pictures with no other material data than blue prints … is simply beyond belief,” declared famed New Hampshire painter Maxfield Parrish. “These drawings should be in a government museum of standards, in a glass case, along with the platinum pound weight, yard stick, etc. to show the world and what comes after just what a mechanical drawing should be. … The pity is that comparatively few will know about them, for their creation should be world news.”When World War II broke out, Porter’s skills were used to show the inner workings of rockets before a prototype had even been made. And when the U.S. military ran short of prisms for use in antiaircraft and artillery pieces, he rallied telescope enthusiasts to boost the supply. The amateurs manufactured more than 28,000 prisms that met the military’s exacting specifications.The war delayed the completion of the Palomar Observatory, but Porter lived just long enough to see it begin operation in 1948. The Hale Telescope allowed humans to see farther into the universe than ever before. It is still in operation today.Late in life, Porter received an honorary doctor of science degree from Norwich University. In January 1949, Middlebury College’s president and fellows voted to do likewise at the school’s spring graduation, but Porter died before he could receive it.As gratifying as those tributes might have been, Porter, that lover of barren landscapes, might have been more thrilled that two celestial craters — one on the moon, one on Mars — were named in his honor.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Art, Architecture, Astronomy and the Arctic — A Vermonter’s curious career.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Arctic-expedition-1024x694.jpeg,,,2025-06-01 07:59:03.190884

This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez and Jessica Kutz of The 19th. Meet Barbara and Jessica and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced this week that the federal government no longer recommends the COVID-19 vaccination for healthy pregnant people and healthy children, a move that immediately raised questions from medical experts.
“Despite the change in recommendations from HHS, the science has not changed. It is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement. “The COVID vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants.”
Kennedy did not cite any data along with his decision, though he has long questioned the need for frequent COVID-19 boosters for children.
Removing COVID vaccines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for pregnant people or children could impact the availability of the vaccines or if they are covered by insurance. Dr. Sean T. O’Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that removing the recommendation “could strip families of choice.”
“Those who want to vaccinate may no longer be able to, as the implications for insurance coverage and access remain unclear. … What is clear is that pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated,” he said.
An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to The 19th’s request for comment.
Here’s what we know about Kennedy’s announcement and how it could impact pregnant people and access to the vaccines.
 Why were COVID-19 vaccines recommended to pregnant people and children to begin with? 

Scientific studies have shown that pregnant people are at higher risk of developing more severe cases of the virus than people who aren’t pregnant. As a result, pregnant people are more likely to end up hospitalized. They are also over 10 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to the general population. Studies have also shown a link between COVID and an increased risk of stillbirth.
Vaccinating pregnant people has not only been shown to lower these risks, but also offers some protection to newborns. Antibodies from a parent who received the vaccine while pregnant can provide some immunity to infants in the weeks and months after birth, according to Charlotte Moser, co-director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “[It] is the safest way to protect those babies,” she said in an email.
Studies have shown that COVID-19 may be less severe in healthy children. But Moser said children who become infected with COVID-19 are at risk of being hospitalized, developing long COVID or dying from the virus. COVID-19 vaccines decrease those risks.
 Will my health insurance still cover a COVID-19 vaccine if I’m pregnant? What about for my children? 

“It is not totally clear yet,” said Joshua Sharfstein, a public health professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He was also a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official under the Obama administration.
Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance providers are required to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC, but some experts, including Sharfstein, are concerned that this announcement could mean insurance companies are no longer mandated to cover the COVID-19 vaccine for “healthy” pregnant people and children.
It’s still too early to know whether private insurance companies will remove vaccines from their coverage. It may still be more cost effective for companies to pay for the vaccine, versus paying for severe illnesses that might result from being unvaccinated, experts said.
Sharfstein said private insurance is still clearly required to cover a COVID-19 vaccine for a pregnant person or child who has a medical condition that meets the criteria for a higher risk of severe COVID.
But it’s unclear who falls under these categories, said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a longtime expert in infectious diseases. She noted that the health secretary is contradicting an FDA announcement last week that listed pregnant people as a high risk category that makes them eligible for the vaccine.
“They need to get their message straight,” she said in an email.
 How will this affect access to COVID-19 vaccines? 

That’s also unclear. Richard Hughes, an attorney at the law firm Epstein Becker Green, who previously served as vice president of public policy for a major vaccine manufacturer during the COVID pandemic, said manufacturers could eventually reduce their supply as they determine their bottom lines. That could shake up overall product availability at doctors’ offices and pharmacies.
In addition, if private insurance companies stop covering the vaccine, it could be a barrier for those with low incomes.
“We know that any amount of out-of-pocket [cost] for a vaccine is going to discourage a patient from getting vaccinated,” he said. “The more that increases, the less likely they are to get it.”
This announcement does not immediately impact the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, a federally-funded initiative that aims to vaccinate children whose parents or caregivers might not be able to afford them. However, given how the health secretary has sidestepped protocol to remove this recommendation for pregnant people, some experts worry that Kennedy may similarly make decisions for the VFC program.
 Wait, so can Kennedy do this?

Medical experts say Kennedy’s announcement — which came via a one-minute video posted on X — appeared unilateral, since a key vaccine panel that would typically make such recommendations did not appear to vote on the matter. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which is housed under the CDC, isn’t scheduled to meet again until June.
Kennedy, as HHS secretary, does have legal authority to modify recommendations made by an advisory committee, according to Hughes.
But experts say this decision is highly unusual. This is the first time a health secretary has circumvented the typical review process for vaccination recommendations, and experts stressed that making these kinds of decisions — which they described as not using the science-based procedures that are in place — puts lives at risk.
Several also noted Kennedy’s lack of medical expertise and his long history of vaccine skepticism.
“This signals that health advice for all Americans is now subject to the whim of the secretary of HHS who has no relevant expertise and a long track record of misleading people about vaccines. This should be of concern to everyone,” said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s school of public health, in an email.
 Will this decision face legal challenges? 

“I expect there will be lawsuits and I expect the administration is not in a good position for those lawsuits,” said Dorit Rubenstein Reiss, a professor of law at the University of California College of Law, San Francisco.
Reiss predicted the decision will be challenged in court by patients who could file a lawsuit if they are denied coverage for the vaccine from insurance companies. Cities and states who buy the vaccination could also sue, she said.
Both the lack of evidence presented by the health secretary and what appeared to be procedural irregularities in making this decision could bolster these court challenges, she said. Not only did Kennedy appear to sidestep the committee that makes these decisions, but he appears in the announcement alongside Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Marty Makary, the commissioner of the FDA. Those men have an anti-COVID vaccine bias, and neither role is typically involved in vaccine recommendations.
“It’s ignoring our usual process that involves expert deliberation and examination of the decision and making what looks like a political decision without a lot of consideration of the effects,” she said.
The fact that Kennedy did not provide evidence for the change is also problematic, Reiss said.
“If you look at the recommendation for pregnant women, it’s a lengthy document by ACIP setting up why they think pregnant women should get the vaccine [which includes] data,” she said. That decision can’t be reversed with a one-minute video on social media, she said. “Under administrative law, an agency is expected to explain its actions.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/preg-1.png,,,2025-06-01 07:59:03.190884
,Mississippi Today,2025-06-01 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Sinners’ and the Blues used to tell epic story of the Great Migration,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/01/sinners-and-the-blues-used-to-tell-epic-story-of-the-great-migration/,"Column: The epic story of the Great Migration — and the influence of Blues music on the world — is at the heart of the epic movie ""Sinners.""","Note: Special screenings of “Sinners” were held in Clarksdale this week after residents decried the lack of a movie theater. You can read more about those events here.

Blues music has long been linked to the mystical or supernatural.
After all, the seminal Blues tale is of legend Robert Johnson selling his soul to the devil at the crossroads of U.S. Highways 49 and 61 in the Delta to be able to play a guitar like no one else.
In the movie “Sinners,” set in 1932 Clarksdale in the very Delta town where Johnson is rumored to have made that faustian bargain, those mystical connections are taken to a whole new level.
The movie is based on the believable theory that music or especially gifted musicians can conjure up magic through their performances. Surely, that theory is relatable. After all, many people have been moved spiritually by all types of music. But the movie concludes these gifted musicians can conjure up good and, yes, bad spirits from the past and the future.
In “Sinners,” Sammie, played by actor Miles Caton, who recently visited Clarksdale for a special showing of the movie, is such a talented musician that vampires are attracted to his offerings.
Yes, this is a vampire movie. On first blush, the movie may not seem all that realistic. After all, why would twin brothers Smoke and Stack, both played by Michael B. Jordan, escape the Mississippi Delta after World War I, move to Chicago and then return home in the midst of Jim Crow and the hatred and lynchings it entailed? That seems almost more unbelievable than vampires.
But the brothers referred to Chicago as Jim Crow with tall buildings, though there also was the inference that they might have returned home to try to escape from some issues they had with their employer, the Al Capone crime syndicate.
The movie is so rich with symbolism that perhaps the juke joint where Sammie, the brothers and their allies try to find safety represents their Mississippi home. And perhaps the vampires that lurked outside represent those migratory cities: rich with opportunities (as the vampires in the movie offer) but also rife with dangers. But near the end of the movie, the dangers of their Mississippi home are made clear in vivid detail.
At the heart of the multidimensional movie, which could be considered a musical, is the story of that Great Migration — the period, of course, when Africans Americans fled the nastiness of the South, taking with them the rich and unique culture of their home.
Mississippi still has the largest percentage of Black residents — about 38% — of any state. But remember, the state had a majority Black population before the Great Migration. Black Mississippians who left had an enormous influence on the rest of the nation, and Black Mississippians who stayed can be credited with helping lead a reckoning over numerous American civil rights.
That reckoning, coupled with other aspects of the Great Migration, forever changed the South, changed the north and arguably changed all the world.
An important part of that change was the expansion and the impact that the Delta Blues brought to the world. That impact was highlighted in the surprising and inspiring feel-good ending that will remain unwritten here in deference to the people who have not yet seen the movie.
Family members of “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler were part of that Great Migration. But in an interview, Coogler said he did not recognize the full extent of that impact until he started researching and making the movie.
“I found that there’s a legitimate argument to be made that the Delta Blues music is America’s most important contribution to global popular culture,” Coogler told IndieWire. “It might be America’s most important artistic contribution to humanity came out of this place, and that’s when I realized that the film had to be epic.”
And it is epic, just as the Great Migration at the heart of the movie was.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/29124042/AP25094161362490.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:59:03.190884

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerChittenden property owner John Gerlach has been found in contempt in the latest development  of an ongoing legal battle with Mountain Top Resort. The May 22 decision came after Gerlach removed a rope barring access to one of the resort’s cross-country trails.The dispute began last summer when Gerlach and his wife, Debra, relocated two of the resort’s trails that ran through their private land.The Gerlachs purchased the property with an easement that allowed Mountain Top Resort to operate ski trails within their property lines, but also permitted the Gerlach family to move trails as long as cross-country skiers had access to similarly safe and groomed trails. The resort’s general manager and activities director said at the time that the two modified trails were too narrow and steep to groom, limiting their cross-country skiing guests’ access and potentially hurting their business.In October, Rutland Superior Court Judge Alexander Burke agreed with the resort in a preliminary injunction, which granted the resort permission to use the original trails and prohibited the Gerlachs from interfering with existing trails or the resort’s maintenance and safety measures.But in February, the resort claimed in a motion to the court the Gerlach family violated the terms of the order by obstructing safety markers and using snowmobile equipment on resort trails. The resort asserted such activities affect employees’ ability to maintain existing trails, although snowmobiles are used on other resort pathways.READ MORE
During a Christmas visit to Chittenden from his primary residence in Florida, John Gerlach took down a rope the resort placed on the Sunset Trail to bar cross-country skiers entry, and used a snowmobile on trails crossing his property where such activities are not allowed by the resort.In the May 22 decision, Burke held John Gerlach in contempt for removing the rope marking the trail closure, but disagreed that use of snowmobile equipment violated the injunction and impaired the resort’s ability to maintain trails. John Gerlach’s son, Jake, also was found to have snowmobiled and repeatedly removed rope from a closed trail during a visit to the Chittenden property in March, but Burke did not find him in contempt, as he was not the subject of the initial injunction.The Gerlachs were ordered to not remove the resort’s trail closure ropes and to instruct their guests to follow suit. The Gerlachs must also pay the resort’s attorney fees related to the motion requesting enforcement of the injunction and sanctions. This is not the only legal conflict the Gerlach family has faced over trails.The Gerlachs claimed the town of Chittenden failed to legally establish a public trail running through their 600-acre property. The previous land owners entered an agreement in 2006 allowing a former road running through the property to be transformed into a publicly accessible hiking trail.In a May 5 ruling, Burke denied the Gerlachs’ request for the court to rule that no past agreements properly set up the trail for public use after a similar route was discontinued in the 1800s. Burke instead granted summary judgement to the town, asserting the previous owners “unequivocally intended to dedicate the disputed trail to public use.”A lawyer for the Gerlach family and lawyers for the town of Chittenden were not immediately available for comment Friday.Khele Sparks, general manager of the Mountain Top Resort, said the resort could not offer comment at this stage of litigation. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trail tensions escalate: Chittenden landowner held in contempt in legal battle with Mountain Top Resort.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mountaintop-resort-1-20241114-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

It’s one of the state’s top food exports.But cacao doesn’t grow in Vermont, and climate change has been disrupting the global supply chain. Vermont businesses that rely on cocoa are having to make changes.Miller Farm, a dairy farm in Vernon, is one of them. Their chocolate milk is one of their best-selling products. But in February, production almost came to a halt.The farm was down to its last bag of cocoa powder. And Peter Miller, one of the owners of Miller Farm, said his usual supplier had run out.“I couldn’t find it anywhere,” he said. “I was told there was a shortage due to climate change.”Eventually, Miller was able to find and buy cocoa powder from a different supplier. But he said changing the farm’s chocolate milk recipe on the fly was “frightening.”A newborn calf named BunBun at Miller Farm on April 22, 2025. Photo by Keely Ehnstrom/CNS“We didn’t know if we’d have a great falling out of customers,” he said. “It’s like if Heinz had to change their ketchup formula. All of the sudden, it tastes different.”The cacao plant grows along the equator, largely in West Africa and Central and South America. Climate change in those regions is making weather unpredictable. And cacao is getting harder to grow.Which means, for consumers like Miller Farm, it’s getting harder to buy.And Miller Farm is not alone.Amy Huyffer and her husband Earl Ransom have been making chocolate milk at Strafford Organic Creamery for about 20 years. Their cocoa powder supplier also recently ran out.Their solution was to amp up their supply of maple milk. Huyffer said they get their maple from a friend down the road.“Unlike cocoa powder that I was working for weeks and then months to try and keep in stock, the maple syrup — I could call and Willis came up that afternoon with a new barrel,” Huyffer said.Strafford Organic Creamery now has chocolate milk again. But Huyffer says she doesn’t know what their supply will look like in the future.A Miller Farm employee bottles chocolate milk in the milk plant on April 22, 2025. Photo by Keely Ehnstrom/CNS“I mean we can make plans all day, but the agricultural gods tend to laugh at them,” she said.Other local businesses are improvising as well.Lake Champlain Chocolates in Burlington is one of Vermont’s largest chocolatiers. And as cocoa gets harder to source, Lake Champlain Chocolates is trying to get creative.“We make our own marshmallows here and we dip them in chocolate,” communications manager Meghan Fitzpatrick said. “So we’re trying to sell really delicious confections that maybe don’t use as much chocolate. You know, leaning into our caramels and other things we make here that don’t require, like, a solid piece of chocolate.”Meghan Fitzpatrick, communications manager of Lake Champlain Chocolates, at its Burlington store on April 16, 2025. Photo by Keely Ehnstrom/CNSErnesto Méndez is a professor of agroecology at the University of Vermont who studies sustainable food systems. He says while climate change affects both the quality and quantity of cacao, there might be a silver lining for cacao farmers.“Climate change is a crisis, but it also brings an opportunity for the farmers to negotiate better prices,” he said.Méndez says the consumers in the Global North might need to start paying more and offering more support to the producers in the Global South.“Of course, they don’t want to do it, because they’re going to lose some of that profit,” he said. “But they’re realizing now that if they don’t do it, they might not have enough supply.”Meghan Fitzpatrick at Lake Champlain Chocolates agrees. She says people and corporations that buy cocoa have long enjoyed low prices.“We — people who enjoy chocolate — we haven’t really been paying what chocolate is worth for a really long time,” she said.Fitzpatrick said Lake Champlain Chocolates started a new program this year to award micro-grants to cacao farmers to help address issues caused by climate change.“We’re looking to make some systemic changes at that level, you know, ensuring our future, because climate change is a real issue with cocoa,” she said.As the climate changes, everyone who is part of the cocoa supply chain is adapting.

Photo courtesy of Jim CarpenterThis story by Liberty Darr was first published in The Citizen on May 29.Some Charlotters might recognize Jim Carpenter as a regular on the pickleball courts, but now all of America knows him as a champion on the beloved television show “Jeopardy,” after winning last Friday’s nail-biter of an episode.The six-year Charlotte resident — born and raised in Burlington — is now one of 53 Vermonters since 1995 who have competed on the show. But according to Alison Shapiro Cooke, the TV show’s executive director of publicity and communications, Carpenter is the only Charlotter to make an appearance in the show’s history.The show itself has garnered a cult following over the years and many people associate watching the show with their growing-up years. For Carpenter, his experience was similar. He said he grew up watching the show with his dad.“Even after I was grown up and gone and would come back and visit, he and I would watch it together and try to beat each other out,” he said.He had been taking the online 50-question “anytime tests” — an entry point for anyone who wants to compete on “Jeopardy” — for a few years but had never actually anticipated being on the big screen. But one day, out of the blue, he got an email asking him to do a monitored test over zoom.“I mean, there are so many people who take those tests, I never really expected much to come of it,” he said.He continued through a few more Zoom tests, making it to the final mock test round before he was placed in a pool of applicants eligible to be on the show, but still the odds of actually getting called aren’t guaranteed.In February, he got the phone call and luckily his wife was around to suggest he answer the random California number that he thought was spam.“My cell phone rings, and I looked at it and it was a California number that I didn’t recognize,” Carpenter recalled. “And my wife, I said, ‘Oh, who’s calling your cell phone?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s California. It’s probably spam.’ She said, ‘Well, no, wait a minute, that might be ‘‘Jeopardy.’’ So, I answered it, and it was.”He flew to Los Angeles in February for two days of filming with nearly 10 other contestants. When it came time for his turn, Carpenter was up against some stiff competition, the prior three-day champion, Brendan Liaw, a recent college graduate from Vancouver.“He was looking pretty hot and pretty confident going into the game,” Carpenter said. “I got off to a little bit of a slow start.”One of the most challenging parts of the game, he said, was learning the timing of the buzzer. Contestants are only allowed to buzz once the entire question has been asked.“You don’t see this on TV, but there are blue lights on either side of the big game board, and those blue lights flash on when the buzzers are actually enabled to answer the question,” he said. “When it comes on, you start clicking away to see if you can actually beat everybody else to the buzzer.”Carpenter, a retired music professor, doesn’t tout himself as some sort of trivia buff. The knowledge that it takes in a multitude of different topics to compete on the show came from being both well-read and well-versed, he said. Teaching music at different colleges and being immersed in the university realm also helped him to engage in a slew of different subjects and conversations.And, of course, he is an avid New York Times crossword buff.“There’s a lot of funny and obscure little bits and pieces that come out of that sort of thing,” he said. “I’ve always just had kind of a sticky memory where I will remember all kinds of odd little bits of information that somehow get stuck in my head.”Carpenter won $25,601 during his first game and ultimately brought home the gold in Final Jeopardy. The question in the category of “Time” was: “Eponymously named and in use for more than 1,600 years, it was based in part on concepts from the Greek mathematician Sosigenes.”Carpenter, the only contestant to answer correctly and wager enough money to give him a leg up, wrote down “What is the Julian calendar?”“Where I knew that from, I have no idea at this point, but it came into my head,” he said, letting out a laugh.While he didn’t secure a win Monday night in his follow-up appearance, competing for that long as a fan — and securing a win as a contestant — was enough for him. Not many people can add ‘winning Jeopardy’ to their list of accolades, after all.“My whole thought was, whether I win or whether I lose, this is an experience that not very many people get to have,” he said. “I was a little nervous going out and certainly hoping that I would not do something to look really dumb in front of a national audience, but my whole mindset was just to go out and enjoy the experience.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  What is: Winning an episode of ‘Jeopardy’?.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jim-carpenter-jeopardy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Morgan Brown has fought to get Vermonters to recognize the humanity of their unhoused neighbors — inspired by his own housing instability. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Montpelier advocate reflects on cancer journey, advocating for unhoused neighbors and how the community has given back to him.","Morgan Brown and his cat Cleo. Photo courtesy of Morgan BrownOn Montpelier’s lively Front Porch Forum, Morgan Brown is one of the most frequent posters, providing local news, commentary and occasional humor. “Can’t sleep at night? Restless?” began one recent post. “Not to worry, call the Insomnia Warmline. Our professionally trained, volunteer, experienced peers, people who are sleepless at night as well, will bore you to sleep.”When Brown went silent for several months this winter, his absence was noted by locals. Upon his return in February, he had some not-so-humorous news to share: He had been diagnosed with an aggressive case of colon cancer and been in and out of the hospital for weeks. The response was immediate and kind. “Morgan Brown, So sorry to hear of your health struggles. I’m thinking of you,” Cindy McCloud wrote on Front Porch Forum. Brown told VTDigger he was incredibly grateful for the Montpelierians who had driven him to the hospital, brought him omelettes and scrambled eggs, and looked after his cat, Miss “Cleo” Cleopatra, while he was gone. “I’ve learned not to say no because that sometimes pisses people off because they want to help,” he said. In mid-May, Brown received a positive update. His oncologist told him he could have a year or more to live if he pursued treatment, rather than his initial prognosis of three months to a year. Photo courtesy of Morgan BrownBrown fully intends to pursue treatment. However, he said he’s still in a lot of pain. “I’m a fighter, and I intend to beat those odds, so I intend to be around for a while,” he said. “Winston Churchill’s favorite saying every day in the morning was, ‘Keep buggering on.’ And that’s basically a model I’ve adopted — keep buggering on.”Brown’s diagnosis has also forced him to retire from his passion of advocating for unhoused Vermonters, especially those living on the streets of Montpelier. Brown has attended protests, served on the city’s Homelessness Task Force, and written commentaries for outlets like VTDigger in support of policies that would provide more compassion and support to unhoused Vermonters. The issue is personal to him. Brown spent 12 years living unhoused, transitioning between a variety of living situations before he found housing 15 years ago. When it comes to housing policy, Brown is adamant and firm. “There shouldn’t be one person living outside,” he said. Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont and a friend of Brown’s, called him a well-respected member of the community who gives with “all of his heart.”She said she was saddened to hear of his cancer diagnosis. “I don’t really want to know a world where Morgan Brown is not part of the life that I have or the work that I do because we need him here,” she said. READ MORE
‘Every person is worth the effort’Brown grew up in eastern Massachusetts but said he never felt connected to it. “I don’t say I’m from there. I say I was plopped there as a little kid,” he said. Photo courtesy of Morgan BrownHe first came to Vermont more than 30 years ago. He had chipped in to help a friend get their car up to Montpelier. From the first time he saw the small city, he knew he wanted to live there. “I saw the kids hanging out in front of City Center. I said to myself, ‘Well, if they can do that, this place is for me, you know, I’ll be accepted,’” he said. For a while Brown lived at Another Way, a local community center for unhoused Vermonters and psychiatric survivors. The center did not usually allow people to live there, but he had an “unofficial” arrangement, he said. “Otherwise, I would have been out in the woods with a tarp,” he said. Eventually, with the assistance of an employee at Washington County Mental Health Services, Brown was able to get a motel room, then an apartment. When asked about how his experience informs his opinions on the housing crisis, he deflected. “I try not to just use my own perspective. I watch and I listen to whoever’s outside and whatever. And I actually draw more on that than my own (experience),” he said.Lately, he’s had a hard time keeping up with the local unhoused community because his health mostly keeps him at home. Brown lives in a small efficiency apartment in a multi-unit building with Cleo, a 12-year-old cat with a “voracious appetite.”His recent hospitalization was the longest the two had been apart since he adopted her 11 years ago. “Ever since I got back from the hospital, she hasn’t let me out of her sight,” Brown said. He recalled one of the last in-person protests he was able to attend was the sleep-in on the steps of the Vermont Statehouse in 2021, when activists camped out at the Capitol for weeks to protest the removal of unhoused Vermonters from the motel program.Although he stayed with them for only one night — and “didn’t get any sleep at all,” he said — Siegel recalled Brown coming by to give the protesters water and moral support, then getting a hotel room in town for them when the protest was over so they could go straight to bed. “He did not tell us, because we would have refused,” she said. “It was just like, I can’t quite describe it, but he would show up with whatever he had and give all of it.”Since then, the two have kept in touch through text and email. Siegel has read Brown’s poetry out loud at various protests and events. “He writes beautiful poetry, and especially beautiful poetry about the experience of homelessness and the experience of watching other people go through it after now that he’s housed,” she said. His poetry, political writing and observations about daily life are collected on his blog, Green Mountain Meandering Missives. At times he addresses his thoughts on the housing crisis directly to Gov. Phil Scott.“It boggles the mind how your administration can be so deliberately indifferent and uncaring when it comes to those who are being or already have been evicted from the Vermont Hotel/Motel Program without those persons having anywhere else safe and secure to go inside, day or night,” he wrote in an open letter to Scott last month.The Legislature and Scott have clashed in recent years over whether to extend funding to the state’s motel program, which housed thousands of Vermonters during the Covid-19 pandemic but has slowly been rolled back. To everyday Vermonters, Brown asked them to consider doing for others what they would want done for their loved ones if they were facing a difficult situation. “What would you want for your loved ones? You’d pull out all the stops, right?” he said. He said society tends to classify certain people as “not worth it” — but Brown said he believes “every human life, every person is worth the effort.”“The problem is sometimes people have given up on themselves, so we need to double down on them. We need to show them that they matter. That somebody cares for them, even if they don’t care for themselves,” he said. “And that, sometimes it helps. Without wanting something from them. They’re not obliged, there’s no expectation. I’m not a religious person, per se, but it’s God’s true love.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Montpelier advocate reflects on cancer journey, advocating for unhoused neighbors and how the community has given back to him.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Morgan-Brown-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Call that a cornerstone of autocracy. For the past 15 years in North […]","The new NC Board of Elections, with all members appointed by the state Auditor, are sworn in on May 7, 2025. Left to right, Jeff Carmon, Chairman Francis DeLuca, Stacy ""Four"" Eggers, Siohban Millen, and Robert Rucho. Our democracy, with free and fair elections at the cornerstone, can be warped in favor of those who manipulate the election process to their advantage – who gets to vote, when and where, and which votes are included when they’re finally counted. Call that a cornerstone of autocracy.
For the past 15 years in North Carolina, ever since Republicans captured majorities in the state House and Senate amid President Obama’s first-term struggles, the party has sought to solidify its hold on power in just that fashion.
The tactics have been manifold: gerrymandering that puts Republicans in disproportionate numbers of safe seats. Photo ID rules that cut against groups of voters who might tend to favor Democrats. Stricter rules for absentee voting that result in some ballots being tossed because they weren’t received in time, perhaps because of postal delays.
Republican legislators have been the driving force behind such changes – with elected Republican judges helpfully turning aside cries of foul from Democrats and their allies among voting-rights advocates.
All of that brings us to a chain of events triggered by last fall’s elections, in which Democrat Josh Stein claimed the governor’s mansion and, by a single seat in the House, Republicans lost their veto-proof legislative majority. The results apparently left Republicans in the General Assembly to vow, “You ain’t seen nothing yet!”
The counter-strategy they cooked up has panned out with what amounts to a hostile takeover of an agency that worked to advance the principles of honest, orderly elections in which every eligible citizen is encouraged to participate. That is of course the State Board of Elections – under control of the governor’s party by virtue of a law dating back decades.
The takeover was set in motion when it became clear that, with Stein’s victory, the board otherwise would continue with a Democratic majority. Legislators decreed that instead of by the governor, appointments to the board would be made by the state auditor – a post captured in the November balloting by Republican Dave Boliek.
In essence, the auditor would hold the reins when it came to the state’s election oversight. The changeover would – and did – take effect on May 1, after Stein’s court challenge was sidetracked by Republicans on the state Court of Appeals and then the state Supreme Court.
Court contest’s lessons
As it would happen, much water went under the bridge between the passage in December (over Stein’s veto) of Senate Bill 382 and the power shift in which Boliek appointed new Republican members to run the board, and the board’s nationally heralded executive director, Democratic appointee Karen Brinson Bell, was ousted.
North Carolina’s political headlines throughout the end of 2024 and the first months of 2025 were dominated by the contested Supreme Court election between Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs and her challenger, Republican Judge Jefferson Griffin of the Court of Appeals.
Riggs’ 734-vote victory finally was nailed down on May 5 – no thanks to Griffin’s allies on the two appellate courts who agreed with him that thousands of votes shouldn’t have been counted. It took a Republican-appointed federal judge to explain why disallowing those votes would have violated the constitutional rights of citizens who cast them.
Here’s where the Riggs-Griffin clash and the Board of Elections saga became intertwined. The board, for reasons ultimately validated by Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Myers, resisted the attempt to disallow votes that Griffin claimed shouldn’t have been counted, even though the people who cast them, including military and overseas voters, hadn’t knowingly violated any rules and there was no evidence of fraud.
If the board hadn’t pushed back, insisting for example that overseas voters actually didn’t need to submit copies of photo IDs, chances are that enough votes from likely Democrats would have been tossed aside that Griffin would have won the race.
Myers boiled down his thinking in everyday language: The legality of certain conduct should be assessed according to the laws in effect at the time. “That principle will be familiar to anyone who has played a sport or board game,” he wrote. “You establish the rules before the game. You don’t change them after the game is done.”
That was the election board’s point all along. Yes, it aligned with Democratic arguments. But nobody would accuse Judge Myers of carrying the Democrats’ water.
Auditor’s mission creep
While Griffin’s effort to overtake Riggs worked its way through the judicial pipeline, the law transferring election oversight to the state auditor was being challenged by Stein as an infringement on his executive powers. He argued that the state constitution gives him final responsibility for seeing that the laws are faithfully carried out, and thus he needs to be able to appoint a majority on the elections board who share his commitment to elections operated in the public interest.
Other attempts by the General Assembly to horn in the powers of Stein’s predecessor, Democrat Roy Cooper, were turned aside by the courts as violations of the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches. In the case of S.B. 382, top lawmakers argued that since state auditors are themselves executive branch officials, the legislature’s constitutional prerogative to assign duties within that branch allows them to take oversight of the elections board away from Stein and give it to Boliek.
In accord with the state’s procedure for refereeing alleged constitutional violations, Stein’s lawsuit was routed to a three-judge panel in Wake County Superior Court.
After a full-dress review, with briefs and oral arguments, the panel on April 23 reached a 2-1 decision that Stein’s complaints were justified. Even though North Carolina parcels out various executive duties to the elected members of the Council of State, including such figures as the state treasurer and the attorney general as well as the state auditor, the panel held that under the state constitution ultimate responsibility for the appointed Board of Elections lies with the governor. The two-person majority included one Democratic judge and one Republican. A Republican judge dissented.
Republican Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall appealed to the Republican-dominated state Court of Appeals. On April 30 – the day before the election board change was to take effect – a three-person panel of the court’s judges sided with the legislators, meaning that the changeover could go ahead. The unanimous, unsigned ruling contained no explanation and the judges who participated weren’t identified. No prizes for accountability there!
Stein filed a last-ditch appeal with the Supreme Court, where Republicans also rule the roost. With no immediate intervention by the high court, Boliek on May 1 took command of North Carolina’s election machinery. Instead of a 3-2 Democratic majority with a Democratic chairman, with Boliek’s appointees the elections board emerged with a 3-2 Republican majority.
The new chairman is Francis De Luca, a Republican activist who hardly has been a cheerleader for so-called same-day registration during early voting – a convenience encouraging many eligible citizens to cast their ballots. Another new member, former Republican state Sen. Robert Rucho, would belong in the Gerrymanderers Hall of Fame, were there such a dubious institution, for his work to tilt the scales in favor of Republican candidates for the legislature and Congress.
High court’s tilt
When the Supreme Court finally responded to Stein’s appeal, it rejected the governor’s argument that the reassignment of election oversight to the auditor should have been blocked while the appellate courts weighed the constitutional issues.
That leaves the election board’s new governance structure intact while Stein pursues his case. Of course as time elapses, as Boliek proceeds to appoint new members of county election boards and as this fall’s elections approach, unwinding that new structure becomes increasingly impractical.
The high court’s opinion was unsigned, meaning it was supported by the five Republican justices, although Justice Richard Dietz in a concurrence criticized the Court of Appeals’ opaque handling of the matter. Dissents came from the court’s two Democrats – Riggs, freshly sworn back into office after her drawn-out election win, and Anita Earls.
“The voters hired Joshua Stein and David Boliek to do specific jobs, and the General Assembly is restructuring those jobs after the election,” Earls wrote. “The General Assembly may not grab power over enforcement of election laws by shuttling the Board [of Elections] between statewide elected officials until it finds one willing to do its bidding.”
Well, that sort of power grab looks to be just what the legislature’s Republican chiefs had in mind, and acceding to it looks to be just what the appellate courts are inclined to do.
Continue down that path, and they’ll be turning over supervision of the state’s elections to people whose “election integrity” mantra has proven to be code for voter suppression driven by right-wing partisanship. Not only does that degrade our democratic system, but it also puts the best interests of many North Carolinians vulnerable to economic, educational, environmental and health challenges at unacceptable risk.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4499-1-1024x366.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Moreover, the problem of fake news is increasing as we become ever more polarized and as our government tries to undermine and to silence media that exposes intentions and actions it wants to keep hidden from us. Adding to the problem is the proliferation of social media posts that may or may not be accurate.
Increasingly, I have become a supporter of independent journalism and have dropped my subscriptions to local papers — owned by what some call vulture equity firms, interested only in power and profit. I’ve even dropped my long-time subscriptions to two well-known national newspapers. Instead, I support my local library, where I can access, online, my local newspaper, as well as national news publications such as The New York Times and The Washington Post.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I am not necessarily advocating that you drop your newspaper subscription. Instead, I am hoping you are aware of the many independent news sources available to you. In Colorado, among those I support are Colorado Sun, Mountain Ear and this newspaper, Colorado Newsline (part of the States Newsroom organization).
Conveniently, in Colorado alone there are many more independent news sources than the three I have named. The Media and Democracy Project has compiled a list that can be found at the organization’s website.
Personally, I also support a number of independent national news sources, some of which are identified online at trustworthymedia.org.
Most crucially, I support those organizations that support independent journalism in a variety of ways — organizations such as the Colorado News Collaborative, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and the Media and Democracy Project.
What do I mean by independent news sources? Independent news sources are those that are free from the influence of governments, corporations or special interest groups, ensuring that what they report is truthful. To determine independence, you could begin by looking at whether the news source is more reliant on facts than on opinions/arguments, by investigating the sources of its funding and whether there are potential conflicts of interest, by evaluating its history and track record (e.g., its record for exposing criminality or abuses of power), and by assessing the extent to which it follows established journalistic standards and ethics.
When I want to ensure that what I am reading is trustworthy, I search for primary sources if available (e.g., a C-Span video or a legal document) and for additional reports on the topic. I search FactCheck.org, Reuters Fact Check, Snopes, and Media Bias/Fact Check, too — all available online.
We are awash in fake news, and it is eating away at our society. We deserve an honest, skeptical, independent press. Too much of corporate-run media is only interested in lining their own pockets at our expense. According to a Sept. 18, 2020, article in TechStartups online:

These media conglomerates are owned by the elite or the ruling class, which extends its reach to encompass not only traditional power structures but also modern behemoths like big tech companies, exerting control over the content we consume — what we read, watch, and listen to …
The term “elite” often slips into our conversations without much thought, yet its roots and significance remain unfamiliar to many. Derived from the French élite, which traces back to the Latin eligere, meaning “to select or to sort out,” elites represent a select group of influential individuals who wield a disproportionate share of wealth, privilege, political power, or expertise within society.

Are you confused and overwhelmed about whom and what to believe?
If so, make a point of becoming a savvy news consumer, and spreader, of truly important and reliable news. Don’t repeat or repost something you’ve read without first checking out whether it’s true. And support independent journalism.

With final passage Saturday of a major early childhood education bill, legislators will return Monday to begin their three-day push to Wednesday night’s adjournment deadline with a limited to-do list topped by adopting a biennial budget and voting on a bipartisan energy deal.
Gov. Ned Lamont, and his wife, Annie, made a surprise visit to the state Capitol as the House debated Senate Bill 1, legislation creating a groundbreaking new fund for early childhood education that was Lamont’s major initiative in a year dominated by his desire to keep state finances under a spending cap.
“I think that’s a really big deal,” Lamont said of SB 1. “That was my No. 1 priority.”
The bill also expands the state’s support for special education, a legislative initiative accepted by an administration wary of new spending, even as the state is sitting on record budget reserves and continues to pay down Connecticut’s considerable unfunded pension liability.
While the governor posed for selfies with Democratic lawmakers, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, invited him to a brief, private discussion about an unresolved budget issue: a desire by Democratic lawmakers to establish even a modest child tax credit.

It was an unscripted moment.
“I was just walking through. Figured we’re here, say hi to the folks, wish them well. They just said, ‘Come on in. Let’s talk about something,’” Lamont said, as he exited the impromptu negotiation.
His top budget official, Jeffrey Beckham, was hastily summoned to join the chat, which also included the governor’s chief of staff, Matt Brokman. Nothing was resolved during the conversation, and the child tax credit’s prospects faded as the day progressed.
The last days of every annual session are unlike the previous months.
The combination of an unyielding constitutional adjournment deadline of midnight Wednesday and a tradition of unlimited debate means little can pass without bipartisan consent, empowering Republican minorities that hold fewer than one-third of seats in the House and Senate.
That shift means that Senate Bill 4, an effort to reduce Connecticut’s high electric rates, was being rewritten to accommodate a demand by House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, over procedures at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.
“There is definitely movement. I think the PURA language that was important, that we’re negotiating, is going our way. We’re having consensus. The legislature has come together in that language. It looks like we will have rate relief,” Candelora said. “It looks like we’ll be able to run it on Monday or Tuesday.”
On Friday, debate on a highway safety bill, HB 7160, was halted while lawyers discussed whether a Republican amendment increasing the penalty for distracted drivers could be adopted under the rules without a referral to the Judiciary Committee. Such a late referral would kill the bill.
“There are always bumps in the road and things that throw us off, right?” House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said Saturday, before the House convened. “I think there’s general agreement on the underlying bill.”
Indeed, the bill was brought back for passage on a 140-5 vote Saturday evening with bipartisan backing — and the briefest of debates. It now goes to the Senate.

There is nuance in how the tradition of unlimited debate and power sharing in the final days is observed. The legislature’s rules allow a motion to end debate and call a vote, a tool rarely employed. If filibusters are overused, Candelora knows that is an invitation for Democrats to call the question. 
What constitutes overuse is not precisely defined.
Candelora opposes Senate Bill 1, which would create an early childhood trust fund that is off budget and outside the spending cap. It passed on a 101-45 vote with no Republican support. But Candelora did not consider trying to stop final passage Saturday with a filibuster.
“We know this is going to be in the budget. So for us to filibuster this and talk it ’til Wednesday is kind of unrealistic, and it’s physically difficult to get members to stay here for six days,” Candelora said.
A multi-day filibuster likely would have provoked a vote to end debate. 
On opening day on Jan. 8, Ritter warned his own party to have their bills ready for votes before the final weeks of the session, when passage grows more difficult. And he cautioned Republicans not to abuse the filibuster. Both warnings were applauded.

The Senate was not in session Saturday after voting for final passage of House Bill 5002, the session’s major housing legislation, at 2:13 a.m. The House came in at noon and worked into the evening, debating SB 1. Both chambers will be in session Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Ritter, Rojas and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, proclaimed themselves satisfied with the annual session, even if scores of bills will die from inaction, as occurs every year.
“We’re in a really good place,” Ritter said.
“We’ve been working really well together so far. So I think that there’s a good opportunity to get a lot more done still,” Duff said.
Duff said the Senate hopes to deliver final passage of a climate bill that is a House priority. The legislation, House Bill 5004, would strengthen the state’s existing carbon-reduction goals and create a new “Clean Economy Council” to develop strategies and policies to help meet those targets.
Rojas said the House intends to vote on Senate Bill 10, a bill that strengthens the state’s rules to ensure insurers comply with mental-health parity coverage requirements. 
Some bills that languish on the final few days might find a path to passage by being folded into a budget bill, but Duff noted that requires agreement of the House, Senate and governor’s office.
He declined to speculate on which favored few might get such treatment.
Seventy-three House bills await final passage in the Senate. Ninety-three Senate bills were on the House calendar Saturday when debate began on SB 1. A small minority are guaranteed votes.
As for the rest?
Ritter smiled Saturday and alluded to the fact it’s the time of year when pretty much anyone can kill a bill simply by talking. If a lawmaker made enemies during the session, they will find out if one of their bills are called.
“Look, Tuesday and Wednesday, we’ll find out how you treated your colleagues, right?” Ritter said. “It’s the ultimate sign of how people feel about you.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_128-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-01 05:01:18.109461

It's time for economic justice—now.","By Fay Lenz, President, The Arc CT
May 23rd marked IDD Awareness and Advocacy Day in Connecticut, established in 2023 through the leadership of the IDD Caucus to raise awareness and advocate for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We joined a strong, bipartisan group of legislators at the Capitol to commemorate the day and urge legislative action, because Connecticut’s nonprofit providers are in crisis. Now, just a week later, the situation has come to a head, and we need to act now.
Organizations and the Direct Service Providers that care for and support individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are being asked to do more with less—year after year. Despite small increases, nonprofit providers operate with 30% less buying power than in 2007 due to chronic underfunding and inflation. This financial instability is not an abstract budget issue—it’s a direct threat to the services thousands of individuals with disabilities and their families depend on every day.

This year, nonprofit providers are requesting a $264 million increase for the current fiscal year and $237 million the following year to restore funding, replace federal COVID-era funds, and raise Medicaid rates. This investment is not just overdue—it is essential.
Meanwhile, the gap between what the state pays its employees and what it provides to community-based nonprofits has grown unacceptably wide. According to one recent report, Connecticut state employee pay reached a record $5.4 billion in 2023. Some employees at the Department of Developmental Services (DDS)—the agency charged with overseeing services for individuals with IDD—earned more than $100,000 in overtime alone.

Consider this example: a single DDS staffer has a base salary of $61,000—already significantly higher than their counterpart at a nonprofit provider. However, when factoring in overtime exceeding $177,000, plus benefits and state retirement (SERS) contributions surpassing $134,000, this employee costs Connecticut taxpayers more than $400,000 per year. And this is just one instance—there are many similar examples. As the Governor works hard to reduce the state’s pension debt, the implications of these inflated salaries on Connecticut’s pension liability are staggering.
DSPs support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), enabling them to lead dignified, inclusive lives in our communities. They perform tasks that range from physical care to emotional support. It’s challenging and deeply rewarding work. Yet, despite its necessity, Connecticut DSPs remain profoundly undercompensated, earning on average just $19.65 per hour, significantly below the state’s calculated living wage of $24.13 for a single adult. DSPs are the backbone of the care system, yet we pay them poverty-level wages.
Let’s be clear: this is an economic justice issue. The majority of DSPs are women of color or minorities, many are raising families while earning wages that qualify them for public assistance. These frontline workers are among the most underpaid professionals in the state, despite performing physically and emotionally demanding work that requires deep commitment and compassion.
Connecticut cannot continue to ignore this injustice. If we value the lives of individuals with disabilities—and if we truly respect the people who support them—we must do better and address this funding disparity now.
I urge state leaders to shift priorities and fully fund nonprofit providers, using some of the “second largest surplus in state history” in a way that will have a meaningful impact. Raise wages for direct service professionals to a livable standard. Stop relying on low-wage, disproportionately minority workers to subsidize a system that cannot function without them.

Every person with a disability deserves consistent, compassionate support that will keep them safe. 
Every worker who provides that care deserves respect, a livable wage, and economic dignity. Connecticut must do better—and it must address this injustice now. I urge you, the citizens of Connecticut, to take immediate action. Contact your legislators and the Governor today and advocate for fair, living wages for our DSP workforce and full funding for our non-profit providers.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-01 08:59:00+00:00,CT Mirror,A delicate dance: Maneuvering around CT’s budget cap,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/01/ct-budget-spending-cap/,CT's options to adhere strictly to the spending cap are limited by dysfunctions that have plagued the mechanism through its 34-year history.,"As legislators and Gov. Ned Lamont scrambled last week to craft a new budget before Wednesday’s deadline, they groped for the latest in a string of maneuvers around a spending cap already strained to its limit.
A plan that already would underfund guaranteed worker benefits and shifts hundreds of millions off-budget to support child care and municipal aid would also abruptly boost, and then shrink, payments into the teachers’ pension fund — all to circumvent a fiscal guardrail Lamont assured business leaders was “sacrosanct” just four months ago.
But options to adhere strictly to the cap are severely limited by dysfunctions that have plagued this budget mechanism throughout its 34-year history. Without the extra spending those gimmicks permit, officials say, the legislature wouldn’t be poised to adopt a new budget before the 2025 session ends on Wednesday.
Put simply, a handful of big programs usually gobble much of the allowable spending growth and leave scraps for everything else. Over time, that creates big problems.
Lamont and legislators have avoided this since 2021, thanks mainly to $2.8 billion in emergency federal pandemic grants they’ve been able to spend outside of the formal budget. In other words, when the cap won’t allow more spending on any item, it could be bolstered with federal aid without breaking the rules.
But those pandemic funds largely have been exhausted, and dealing with the spending cap has never been more challenging.
Lamont: ‘A lot of people are gnashing their teeth’
“Let’s face it, I think a lot of people are gnashing their teeth under the [fiscal] guardrails,” Lamont said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon, explaining why he and Democratic lawmakers were grappling with yet another cap-centered impasse in budget negotiations. 
At first glance, the limit is relatively simple. Legislators may budget what they did the prior year, plus some growth that reflects average household income or inflation, whichever is greater. 
About one-quarter of the budget — payments on bonded debt and some pension contributions — aren’t subject to cap limits. Prior to 2017, neither was aid to poor cities and towns.
Legislative leaders told the governor last week they wanted to spend roughly $200 million beyond what the cap would allow in the 2026-27 fiscal year, the second of the new biennial budget. 
The solution they convinced Lamont to accept was unconventional but not illegal.
They agreed to make a one-time, $200 million payment — on top of the required $1.7 billion — into the teachers’ pension fund in 2025-26, which will be the last year of a temporary cap exemption for these contributions.

Rules call for the spending cap limit to grow two years from now to accommodate the teachers’ pension line item when it comes back under this system. But Democrats say the cap limit should grow by an extra $200 million in 2026-27, even though the bonus payment won’t be repeated that year.
That then would leave $200 million legislators could spend on something else without exceeding the cap.
Lamont’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham, has been urging lawmakers throughout the 2025 legislative session to remember the system is about affordability and sustainable budgeting.
“We are responsible to taxpayers; therefore, spending must be sustainable and not grow faster than our residents’ ability to pay,” Beckham said in late April after the Appropriations Committee proposed to exceed the cap next fiscal year by $215 million.
Spending cap has plagued governors, legislatures for decades
But the budget is complex, and a few programs can hijack much of the spending growth allowed each year.
While the capped portion of the budget grew just 7% between 2015 and 2019, required contributions to pensions for state employees and teachers combined increased 36%. And that included a deal with unions to defer portions of contributions owed this decade into the 2030s and 2040s.
The state faces a similar problem now with Medicaid.
Since 2021, the capped portion of the budget has grown 30%, sparked by a 40-year high in inflation in the summer of 2022.
But after Lamont agreed two weeks ago to allow a $284 million cap exception in the current fiscal year — chiefly to cover cost overruns in the Department of Social Services’ Medicaid account — spending growth in that program was up 46% since 2021.
Legislators foresaw these potential problems 34 years ago when they created the cap and included an emergency process to overrule the spending growth formula. The governor first must declare a fiscal emergency in writing, and 60% of both the House and Senate must approve.
But from the late 1990s through 2007, Republican Govs. John G. Rowland and M. Jodi Rell teamed up with Democratic-controlled legislatures to legally exceed the cap seven times.
Future governors and legislators would criticize this as fiscally irresponsible. Any exception became politically taboo after Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who succeeded Rell in 2011, inherited a budget deficit topping 18% and approved a tax hike estimated at more than $1.8 billion a year. 
Has CT over-corrected for past fiscal mistakes?
Still, many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the legislature say Connecticut has over-corrected for its past mistakes and now is allowing the cap to starve vital services.
Medicaid payments to doctors and others who treat the poor haven’t been adjusted broadly since 2007, leaving many low-income families unable to find treatment.
Nonprofit agencies that serve clients with developmental disabilities miss out on hundreds of millions of dollars annually because state payments haven’t matched inflation for decades. Cities and towns say the same is true of state aid for K-12 schools.
Meanwhile, the spending cap — coupled with other aggressive budget controls enacted by both parties in 2017 — has generated unprecedented annual surpluses averaging $1.8 billion, which equals about 8% of the General Fund.
That’s deceptively large, considering about three-quarters of the budget involves wages, benefits, Medicaid, debt service and other fixed costs.
This year’s projected surplus approaches $2.4 billion, or 10% of the General Fund. Analysts estimate the state will continue to save more than $1 billion annually through at least 2028.
These surpluses, used mainly to shrink Connecticut’s hefty pension debt, have become a source of frustration for many Democratic legislators and other advocates who insist core programs are slipping badly.
“I think members are looking to make a significant investment in our state this year, and we’re tired of hearing the governor say there’s not enough money when we know there is,” said Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, a progressive Democrat from West Hartford.
Co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee, Gilchrest spearheaded a push to invest $250 million across four years in Medicaid rates. Nonetheless, the budget to be adopted this week is expected to order a much smaller investment. Advocates seeking big funds for nonprofit social service agencies also are bracing for little new money.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, called the lack of investments in health care and social services two of his biggest disappointments.
“We do agree with the governor, the state’s in a better position financially” because of the spending cap, he said. “But we probably have gone a little too far.”

Labor groups descended on the Capitol en masse Saturday to protest insufficient spending on core programs and demand immediate reform of spending caps.
“If Gov. Lamont truly wanted transparency, he would declare a fiscal emergency and suspend the roadblocks,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a coalition of more than 60 labor, faith and civic organizations.
Connecticut has pledged in legal covenants with bond holders not to alter any of its budget caps dramatically before July 1, 2028, when many expect a landmark reform debate.
Lamont struggled to keep his own budget proposal under the cap
In the meantime, legislative leaders are trying to bend the limits without breaking them.
They’re not the only ones.
To keep the $55.2 billion two-year budget he proposed in February under the cap, the governor employed several workarounds. 
First, he would underfund contractually required health care benefits for retired state workers by about $114 million per year. Comptroller Sean Scanlon says he hopes to mitigate that gap by negotiating savings with insurance providers, but any remaining deficit would be taken from the retiree health care trust — meaning the cost, plus interest, would be covered by future taxpayers.
Lamont also proposed borrowing rather than paying cash for a $60 million grant program that helps towns cover road paving and winter snow plowing. Borrowing occurs outside of the formal budget and spending cap.
Finally, he would shift $300 million from surplus into an off-budget account to fund future increases in early childhood development programs.
Given these maneuvers and the latest cap workaround involving the teachers’ pension, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Lamont and Democratic legislators clearly are bending the rules.
“It’s a gimmick to pay something off budget in the first year, bring it on budget in the second year, to escalate the spending cap,” he said.

Candelora added he suspects the entire budget “is going to be cobbled together with gimmicks that do [an] end-around the spending cap.”
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, predicted fiscal chaos when Lamont first agreed to legally exceed the spending cap two weeks ago. “Get your pocketbooks, your wallets ready,” he said. “You’re going to give over more of your money [to] the state of Connecticut.”
Lamont spokesman: ‘The spending cap remains sacrosanct.’
Chris DiPentima, president and CEO of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, heard Lamont’s declaration that the spending cap is “sacrosanct” back on Jan. 15.
The business leader said from the moment the governor proposed his biennial budget on Feb. 5, complete with some cap gimmicks, he feared legislators would embrace them and offer more.
“That’s got us very alarmed, that we’re just ignoring the spending cap when all is said and done and not making hard decisions” to cut spending, DiPentima said.
But Lamont’s political options are limited.
Democrats threatened last week to suspend the 34-year-old requirement that Connecticut adopt a two-year budget — designed to encourage long-range fiscal planning — unless they could find more options to work around the spending cap in 2026-27.
The alternative, Ritter said, was to adopt a plan covering just 12 months through June 2026.
That would be problematic, to say the least, for Lamont, should he seek reelection next year.
Under that scenario, Lamont would have no approved spending plan in place should he fail to strike a budget deal with legislators next spring. And he would be faced with the chaotic prospect of managing underfunded departments by executive order, even as his reelection campaign entered the home stretch.
But despite some of the compromises the governor made this year to secure another two-year budget, spokesman Chris Collibee said “the spending cap remains ‘sacrosanct,’” and while legislators won’t see all the funding they wanted, there are new investments and fiscal stability.
“Our ‘kitchen table’ approach to budgeting over the past six years is the reason why Gov. Lamont was able to provide some flexibility in spending to cover essential services,” he said. “While other states are reducing services and/or increasing taxes, here in Connecticut have not only gotten our fiscal house in order but are doing the opposite.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0531_SR_Session_194-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-01 05:01:18.109461

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Bad weather doesn’t keep business hours.
Of the top 10 tornadoes that have wreaked death and destruction in Kansas, most came near or after dark, according to the National Weather Service. The Udall tornado of 1955 struck at 10:15 pm and killed 80, making it the deadliest twister in state history.
That’s why the National Weather Service’s closing of the Goodland forecast office overnight is so alarming. Goodland is among eight locations that had reduced their hours, or were planning to, because of the Trump administration’s cuts to the federal government. Staffing at the NWS has taken a beating under DOGE, according to reporting by the Washington Post. In an open letter, five former NWS directors warned the cuts may “endanger lives.”
The Goodland office serves northwest Kansas and parts of Nebraska and Colorado. About 17 miles from the Colorado border on I-70, severe weather around Goodland ranges from tornado-producing spring storms to winter blizzards that shut down the interstate.
But it’s not just the Goodland County Warning Area, a 21,000-square-mile region with more than 80,000 people, that’s at risk. Understaffing at Goodland and other forecast offices that have curtailed hours, including Wyoming and California, creates an additional burden for meteorologists at fully staffed locations. Somebody has to keep an eye on the weather, because the NWS is the federal agency responsible for issuing advisories, watches, and warnings.
If you live in Tornado Alley, you know how essential those warnings can be. The alley is a broad swatch of the Great Plains, from Texas to South Dakota, where dry cold air from the northwest collides with warm moist air from the south. Kansans are familiar with the feeling along about dusk when conditions are ripe for a twister. The sky turns a peculiar shade of green, a thunderstorm approaches and the air smells like river water.
A public affairs specialist for the NWS at Silver Springs, Maryland, did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. Specifically, the spokesperson was asked if the Goodland office would remain closed overnight, and whether that represented a threat to public safety.
While the NWS did not respond, a spokesman for the union that represents federal weather service workers said there was no immediate crisis. Meteorologists at other regional forecast offices had agreed to keep an eye on the weather while the Goodland office was closed overnight. But, he said, a 20% reduction in forecast office staffing since Trump took his second oath of office poses a long-term threat.
“There is no question that the public safety for the community is at risk,” said Tom Fahy, legislative director of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. “(The workers) have done everything they can to shore up the holes and come up with a work flow schedule that will allow individuals not to be burned out.”
Weather service employees are dedicated, hard-working individuals, he said, who take their mission to protect lives and property seriously.
The Goodland is among the two worst hit of the 122 forecast offices in the nation, Fahy said. Goodland normally has 13 meteorologists, but because of DOGE cuts and a federal hiring freeze imposed in January, is down to just five. It ties with a forecast station in Hanford, California, as the most understaffed.
While we are at the tail end of what is usually thought of as tornado season, May through early June, the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory at Norman, Oklahoma, cautions that twisters are unpredictable. They can come at any time of the year, at any time of the day, and meteorologists still aren’t sure what causes them.
“The truth is that we don’t fully understand,” according to the Severe Storms Laboratory website. “The most destructive tornadoes occur from supercells, which are rotating thunderstorms with a well-defined radar circulation called a mesocyclone. (Supercells can also produce damaging hail, severe non-tornadic winds, frequent lightning, and flash floods.)”
While I’ve seen scores of small twisters form, touch down, and spin themselves away within a few minutes, I’ve never spotted a really large tornado. These storms are measured by the Enhanced Fujita Scale, from 0 to 5, based on estimates of observed damage. A common EF0 has wind gusts up to 85 mph and produces little damage. A rare EF5 has wind speeds of more than 200 mph and produces “incredible” damage. The tornado that struck Udall in 1955 was an EF5. So was the Greensburg twister of 2007 and the Joplin, Missouri, tornado of May 2011, a storm that killed 158 people and demolished a third of the town.
I witnessed the aftermaths of the Greensburg and Joplin tornadoes in my capacity as a journalist, and the devastation of each was nightmare-like. In Greensburg, houses were turned to kindling and schools were reduced to piles of bricks. Trees were snapped off at about 10 or 12 feet, as if somebody had driven a giant lawnmower across town.
At Joplin, there was similar destruction, and the neighborhood where my grandfather’s house had stood was unrecognizable. The area looked like it had been shredded by a buzzsaw and then flattened. The human suffering across town was on a massive scale that night, with bodies in the streets and survivors sitting on curbs wearing trash bags as their only defense against the rain. I’ve never taken a roof over my head for granted since.
The Greensburg tornado was a two-mile wide EF5 that blew up from the southwest. The National Weather Service issued a warning for Greensburg at 9:19 p.m. The storm hit Greensburg dead-center at 9:45, destroying approximately 1,000 homes and businesses, or about nine-tenths of the town. The response by the Federal Emergency Management Agency required 15 federal entities, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Now, cuts to the weather service by DOGE in the name of governmental “efficiency” threaten to cripple the weather alert warning systems that saved untold lives in Greensburg. There was no such warning system in 1955 for Udall, and that’s one of the reasons that casualties were so high. To decrease the number of staff available for weather forecast offices in the name of efficiency is like reducing the number of life preservers on an ocean liner to save space.
But the explanation that DOGE is out to improve government by making it smaller and more effective is a canard. The real reason the NWS and other federal agencies are being kneecapped is to punish federal workers, dismantle the machinery of government, and achieve a long-cherished dream of neoliberalism, an economic philosophy from 1938. Don’t let the name fool you, because there’s nothing liberal or progressive about it.
Never heard of it?
Allow me a few paragraphs to explain.
“Its anonymity is both a symptom and a cause of its power,” write George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison in their 2024 book on neoliberalism. “It has caused or contributed to most of the crises that now confront us: rising inequality; rampant child poverty; epidemic diseases of despair; off-shoring and the erosion of the tax base; the slow degradation of healthcare, education, and other public services; the crumbling of the infrastructure; democratic backsliding; the 2008 financial crash; the rise of modern-day demagogues, such as Viktor Orban, Narendra Modi, Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, and Jair Bolsonaro; our ecological crises and environmental disasters.”
Neoliberalism, according to Monbiot and Hutchison, is an ideology whose central belief is that competition is humanity’s defining feature, but that our greed and selfishness and the free market will lead to social advances. The term “neoliberal” was coined at a conference in Paris in 1938, but it’s been around since at least 1776, when Adam Smith used the metaphor of the “invisible hand” in his “Wealth of Nations.”
Put another way, think of Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone’s 1987 movie “Wall Street.” In the movie, Gekko — played by Michael Douglas — says greed is “good.” Gekko’s soliloquy of nearly 40 years ago sounds disturbingly modern.
“America has become a second-rate power,” Gekko says. “Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. Now in the days of the free market when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the stockholder. … The point is, ladies and gentleman, is that greed, for lack of a better word, is good.”
Greed, according to Gekko, will save that “malfunctioning corporation” called the USA.
What does this have to do with the National Weather Service?
Everything.
The DOGE cuts aren’t meant merely to make the federal government smaller, but also to make certain sectors of it ripe for privatization. The transfer of public sector assets to private companies is a long-held neoliberal tenet. And the privatization of the National Weather Service is an unambiguously stated goal of Project 2025, the right-wing playbook for the second Trump administration.
Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior social scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, argued in a March essay that privatizing the weather service would result in the greatest harm to those who are the least able to pay for critical warning information.
“Public services exist to provide parity in access to all people in society without regard to their ability to individually fork out money for such a service,” Declet-Barreto wrote, “so those unable to pay will end up paying twice: once with their tax dollars, and once with their wellbeing or with their lives. Paywalled weather alerts will deprive individuals, households, or towns with lower income of access to life-saving services.”
Fahy, the weather service union legislative director, told me he doubts the weather service will be privatized, because so many commercial firms already get its data for a few dollars a month.
But I’m not so sure, because the “commercialization of weather technologies” is so clearly spelled out in Project 2025. It’s all on page 675, in which the NWS is identified as part of a “colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity.”
Know what else is harmful to prosperity? Tornadoes that eat your town.
Here in Kansas, we typically associate weather alerts with tornadoes, flooding, blizzards, and temperature extremes. But every location across the country has its own hazards, from wildfires to volcanic ash to hurricanes.
But weather alerts aren’t the only things under threat by DOGE cuts. Of the 15 federal agencies responding to Greensburg in 2007, many are now targeted for downsizing. This may lead to little warning of severe weather and reduced help after. We’re already seeing the latter, as Trump’s FEMA has denied disaster relief requests from states hit by tornadoes and hurricanes.
Michael Lewis devoted a chapter to the Joplin tornado in his 2018 book, “The Fifth Risk.” The death toll in Joplin was the highest since the government had started issuing tornado warnings, in 1948. But it wasn’t the failure of the National Weather Service that had killed 158 in Joplin, Lewis concluded, because the sirens blared 17 minutes before the storm hit. Instead, it was the inability of citizens to understand their government — and the inability of the government to understand its citizens. Not enough Joplin residents had sought shelter when warned because they had the “false confidence” they would not be hit. Even a congressman misunderstood that weather channels and phone apps come from data provided by the NWS.
For complicated reasons, human beings have a difficult time imagining the things that might actually kill them. Lewis said that’s one of the reasons, after the Joplin tornado, that the weather service began encouraging news outlets to help people imagine what might happen if they didn’t take cover: “Complete destruction of entire neighborhoods … making the area unrecognizable to survivors.”
Comparable warnings are appropriate for the era of Trump and DOGE.
We were told, but we just couldn’t imagine how bad it would be. Surely our weather forecast center, our university, our Medicaid won’t be hit. Now we have some of the damage assessments, and it amounts to an EF5 political disaster.
The crippling of the NWS forecast office at Goodland is a symptom of a hostile takeover of the federal government by a quasi-governmental group, DOGE, that until recently was headed Elon Musk, the president’s biggest donor. DOGE’s actions have made little sense, unless you think cruelty makes sense, or unless you realize they resemble the way in which a corporate raider will strip assets from a company and then sell off the carcass.

No one is trying to collect it.,"“This is the number one form of tax evasion in Connecticut.  Connecticut is losing millions annually and our DMV does not care.”
So says Stonington Tax Assessor Jennifer Lineaweaver, president of the state association for her profession, the Connecticut Association of Assessing Officers.  She’s speaking of Connecticut residents who register their cars in other states to avoid local property taxes.  “Connecticut is also losing money on registrations, emissions, insurance and unpaid parking tickets that cannot be enforced,” she says.


It’s super easy to get Maine plates for your vehicles… without even traveling to the state or having an address there.  You can even register in Montana, a scheme especially popular with expensive motor home owners.
A couple of years ago Vermont admitted there were 3,600 cars registered in that state by Connecticut residents.  In Maine there were 1,400.  In Bridgeport, City Councilman Alfredo Castillo was even caught with five cars registered next door in Shelton, where taxes were lower, trying to save himself $1,300 in property tax.  
“I am absolutely certain that those [out-of-state] numbers are extremely low,” says Assessor Lineaweaver.  So the losses are even worse than you might think.
The problem is there’s almost no enforcement of Connecticut laws.
“Connecticut DMV says that ‘taxation’ is not their issue,” she says.  “A few years ago, we had the law changed so that DMV would have to look up any out-of-state plate that the assessor requests and DMV had the law reversed a year later.  During the one year [the law] was in place, DMV refused to comply with the law and said they would have the law repealed the next year, which they did.”
Not getting much help from the Division of Motor Vehicles, some cities have hired private firms to help. In 2022, Danbury contracted Capital Tax Recovery to scan license plates throughout the city.  Over 8,000 vehicles were under investigation. The firm pocketed 40% of the additional tax revenue collected as their fee, with no upfront cost to the city.  In Waterbury they caught 4,000 cars. In Stamford almost 8,000 cars were caught, bringing that city $1.3 million.
Many towns allow anonymous reporting of scofflaws.  If your neighbor has Montana plates you can also wish them good luck getting a town dump sticker or beach pass requiring proof of local residence.
Connecticut DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera tells me the problem with out-of-state plates is that drivers often claim legal residence in another state, like Florida.  “If they live there six months and a day, they’re considered legal residents [of Florida],” he told me. 
But Connecticut law mandates that vehicles “garaged” in a municipality —meaning regularly parked overnight, even on the street— must be taxed there, regardless of where they may be officially registered.  Spend your winter in the Sunshine State, but more than 90 days each summer in Connecticut, and you have to pay, even with those Florida plates. The penalty is a $1,000 fine.
In Connecticut, the vehicle property tax is a significant source of revenue for municipalities: $1 billion a year.  But why does a car in New Britain pay four times the tax than the same vehicle in Greenwich?  These inequities just encourage tax avoidance which is, apparently, rampant and unchecked.
“We don’t have the staff [to enforce this],” the DMV Commissioner laments. His agency has its own sworn, gun-carrying police force, but Guerrera says they only work on truck inspections…. even though “registration compliance” is, according to law, one of their duties.
How is our legislature handling this problem?  With a “task force” which met seven times in 2023 considering reforms.  But it never reached a consensus and never approved their final report.  In any case, their draft recommendations were given a thumbs-down by Connecticut Department of Revenue Services Commissioner and former mayor of Danbury Mark Boughton. 
So, what’s a car owner to do?  Well, I hear that Montana is a nice place to visit in the summer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/florida-plate.jpg,,,2025-06-01 05:01:18.109461

SPRINGFIELD — Nearly every year, Illinois lawmakers pass a package of measures dealing with the state’s Medicaid program, the joint federal and state health care program that covers low-income individuals.

Known as the Medicaid omnibus bill, it sometimes includes bold components, like a 2021 initiative that made millions of dollars available to local communities to help them plan and design their own health care delivery systems. Other packages have focused on smaller changes like guaranteeing coverage for specific conditions and medications or adjusting reimbursement rates for different categories of health care providers.

And moThe Illinois General Assembly passed a scaled-back Medicaid package on the last day of the session Saturday.st years, the packages receive bipartisan support because they are negotiated, largely behind closed doors, by an unofficial, bipartisan Medicaid Working Group.

This year, however, lawmakers passed one of the narrowest packages in recent memory, due mainly to the Trump administration’s vows to make sweeping cuts in federal funding for the program while state lawmakers faced their own set of budget constraints.

“There were many, many, very worthy program expansions, rate increases that we considered during this process that we were unable to include because of the uncertainty in Washington,” Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, the current chair of the Medicaid Working Group, said on the House floor Saturday.

The Illinois Medicaid program currently costs about $33.7 billion a year, according to the Department of Healthcare and Family Services. Of that, $20.9 billion, or about 62%, comes from the federal government while much of the state’s share comes from taxes levied on hospitals, nursing homes and managed care organizations – money the state uses to draw down federal matching funds.

The program covers nearly 3.5 million people in Illinois, or about a quarter of the state’s population. According to the nonpartisan health policy think tank KFF, the program pays for 40% of all child births in Illinois while covering 69% of all nursing home residents.

This year’s Medicaid omnibus bill, a 231-page amendment inserted into Senate Bill 2437, contains items that could be hugely beneficial to many Medicaid enrollees, but which don’t carry large price tags. In fact, the entire package is estimated to cost just under $1 million.

One of this year’s additions would make it easier for family members of medically fragile children who qualify for in-home nursing care to receive training to become certified family health aides, a designation that would enable them to administer medications, help with feeding and perform many of the same tasks as a certified nursing assistant.

Another provision would require all hospitals with licensed obstetric beds and birthing centers to adopt written policies that permit patients to have an Illinois Medicaid certified doula of their choosing to accompany them and provide support before, during and after labor and delivery.

Although those provisions enjoyed bipartisan support, another provision that extends coverage to certain categories of noncitizens drew Republican opposition Saturday, resulting in a partisan roll  call vote.

The program covers noncitizens who meet the income requirements for Medicaid and have pending applications for asylum in the United States or for special visas as victims of trafficking, torture or other serious crimes. Those individuals can receive coverage for up to 24 months, provided they continue to meet the eligibility requirements.

Moeller said the language was not a new extension of health care benefits to noncitizens, but instead a “technical and administrative fix” to an existing program that had been requested by the Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

But for Republicans, the programs sounded too similar to the more controversial programs, Health Benefits for Immigrant Seniors and Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults, that extend health care to a large category of people who are not U.S. citizens, including some who are in the country illegally.

“For us on this side of the aisle, that is the poison pill,” said Rep. Noreen Hammond, R-Macomb, the deputy House minority leader. “So in spite of the fact that we have article after article in here, that is very worthy of a yes vote, I would urge a no vote.”

At Gov. JB Pritzker’s request, the budget bill lawmakers passed Saturday night cancels the program for immigrant adults, which had covered about 31,000 noncitizens age 42-64. But it provides $110 million over the next year, all in state funds, for the immigrant seniors program, which covers about 8,900 noncitizens age 65 and over.

The Medicaid bill passed the House late Saturday night, 76-39. It then passed the Senate shortly after midnight, 36-19.

It next goes to Pritzker’s desk for his consideration.

The state’s largest electric utility says it needs to significantly increase its energy capacity to accommodate a potential wave of data centers.
Georgia Power plans to turn to some renewable energy to generate that electricity, but for the most part, the utility intends to lean on fossil fuel sources like gas-fired power plants to boost capacity.
Those controversial plans, packed into what’s called an integrated resource plan, received a public airing during three days of public hearings. Several clean energy advocacy groups and state regulator staffers urged members of the Georgia Public Service Commission to reject the plan.
Commissioners are set to vote on the proposal in July.
Data centers fuel growth forecasts
Georgia Power projects that over the next several years the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption, and the company is requesting to add about 9,000 megawatts of capacity by 2031. According to the utility’s forecasts, data centers will consume about 80% of the new power generated.
But some have questioned the accuracy of those projections.
PSC staff expert witnesses said this week they are concerned Georgia Power is using incorrect model forecasts. They also say the utility has not provided evidence showing that data centers are likely to materialize at a higher rate than other industries.
Georgia Power attorneys say the company’s forecast continues to grow based on the state’s economic projections for commercial and industrial customers.
PSC staff questioned the models used by the company that led to forecasting as much as 13,000 megawatts of peak load growth through 2044. The staff is recommending Georgia Power decrease its load growth projections for data centers by as much as 25%.
“Our recommendation is to adjust down Georgia Power’s load forecast,” said Robert Trokey, director of the Public Service Commission’s electric unit. “I think it’s important that they continue to file the data that they have been filing in quarterly reports. If we see trends continue over the short term as the projects roll out, then certainly Georgia Power should adjust its forecast methodologies.”
Advocacy groups have argued that overbuilding the infrastructure could shift the cost burden to ratepayers.
Public Service Commissioner Tricia Pridemore pushed back on the criticism, pointing to a recent rule change that requires data centers and other large companies consuming more than 100 megawatts of energy to cover their full electricity costs.
The change included a provision allowing Georgia Power to require companies to put up front-end collateral for energy costs over the lifetime of the contract. State regulators would also review any contract for high-energy users.
Clean energy versus fossil fuels
Georgia Power has come under fire for reversing plans to shutter a pair of coal plants, Bowen and Scherer. The company instead is asking that state regulators sign off on extending the life of the two plants and allow the company to ramp up its fossil fuel energy capacity.
The utility had planned to retire Bowen and Scherer by 2028. Since then, Georgia Power has cited the projected industrial growth boom primarily driven by massive data centers as a reason it is now planning to retire Bowen by 2035 and Scherer Unit 3 by 2038.
Energy experts and clean energy advocates expressed concerns about the company’s potential overestimation of electricity demand and the underestimation of gas-fired unit costs, which could lead to higher rates.
They recommended increasing planning flexibility, updating load forecasts, and exploring earlier deployment of renewables and energy storage. Their analysis compared different scenarios, showing that renewables and energy storage are more economical under various future conditions.
Critics of the plan advised the commission to require Georgia Power to present additional research portfolios and improve forecast accuracy. The company was also urged to further increase its investments in renewable energies like solar.

Energy consultant Maria Roumpani, who testified on behalf of the Georgia Conservation Voters, said that renewable energy and storage are much more economically viable than the expansion of gas-fired power plants.
“The analysis should focus on enabling earlier years of deployment for wind and energy storage, especially medium and low duration, as well as higher limits for solar,” she said.
Public, protestors weigh in
Clean energy and consumer advocates held a rally outside the PSC’s downtown offices while the hearing was underway Tuesday, warning of the potential consequences if the commission rubber-stamps Georgia Power’s long-term energy plans.
The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15.
Hundreds of written comments poured into the PSC, many of them dominated by concerns about rising utility bills and health risks tied to fossil fuels.
However, the three days of hearings began with public comments expressing split reactions to Georgia Power and its energy plans.
The long-term energy generation plan is receiving support from the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and local chamber officials such as Timothy Craig, director of business development of Valdosta-Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce.

Craig told commissioners that he felt the company’s energy plan provides the necessary infrastructure to continue providing reliable electricity to businesses.
“One of the first questions small business owners want to ask is: can I count on the systems that support my business?” Craig said this week. “Energy is at the top of that list. Whether it’s a local bakery or high tech firm, reliable energy is essential. Georgia Power’s plan delivers that reliability.”
Retired educator Bette Holland, founder of North Georgia Conservation Coalition, said it’s important that state regulators accept the science that shows that burning coal, oil and natural gas detrimentally increases the earth’s temperature.
“Solar and wind are much cheaper than fossil fuels to create energy,” Holland said. “The only thing that stops us are the energy companies and regulators who bow to the pressure of the fossil fuel companies. Please begin to think about the survival of the people in Georgia, in this country, on this planet, and about the survival of our natural resources in our wildlife.”

SPRINGFIELD – Giving almost no time for public review, Illinois Democrats pushed through a $55.2 billion budget for next fiscal year late Saturday, bolstering coffers with new taxes on sports bets, nicotine products and businesses.

The $55.2 billion spending plan is supported by $55.3 billion of revenue, including just over $1 billion in new taxes and revenue changes.

The four bills making up the budget and capital spending plan, were part of a flurry of thousands of pages of legislation that went from introduction to passage in the final 48 hours of the legislative session.

The budget marked a roughly 3.9% spending increase from the current year, while Republicans criticized it for containing few cuts. It raises about $500 million more in new revenue than what Gov. JB Pritzker proposed in February to make up for declining base revenues.

The minority party also aired frustration with supermajority Democrats for providing next to no time for public review of the massive spending plan and other major bills.

“We’re rushing this process like we always do. ‘Let’s hide this stuff. Let’s hide it so that the public doesn’t see it until it’s too late,’” Rep. John Cabello, R-Machesney Park, said.

Democrats said it was the best budget they could manage in a difficult year. To address potential uncertainties stemming from federal policy changes, they gave the governor authority over a new $100 million “emergency” fund. And they frequently lobbed criticisms at President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.

“I am very pleased to be able to present a balanced budget crafted to be fiscally and socially responsible, because we see the decisions made in Washington right now are neither,” House Majority Leader Robyn Gabel, D-Evanston said. “Erratic leadership in Washington has affected our economic outlook, our revenue projections, and even threatened federal funding for our most crucial services.”

The GOP also took issue with the tax increases, although the measure did not raise or create new sales, income or service taxes.

Instead, the measures expand state taxes on foreign and out-of-state income for businesses, raise tax rates on tobacco, vapes and sports gambling, and sweep fund balances from several lesser-known and utilized state funds.

The spending measure, Senate Bill 2510, passed the House 75-41 just before 10 p.m. The Senate followed around 11:30 p.m. with a 34-23 vote. The revenue and tax changes, House Bill 2755, and the budget implementation bill, House Bill 1075, both passed with relative ease before the constitution’s midnight deadline and only Democratic votes as well. Gov. JB Pritzker issued a statement saying he would sign it.

Another spate of tax increases included in a transit governance overhaul bill surfaced late but sputtered. The failed measure would have added a $1.50 fee on food and package deliveries and taxed electric vehicle charging statewide among other changes. Talks on that bill could resume later this year.

New taxes on vaping, gaming, deliveries 

The revenue bill creates a tax of 25 cents per wager for a sports betting licensee’s first 20,000 wagers accepted, and 50 cents per wager after that.

Consumers will also see new taxes on tobacco products. The tax rate will rise to 45% from 36%. Vape products and nicotine pouches would also now be included under the tax.

The revenue plan amends state law to tax sales from all businesses that transact in the state, rather than only businesses with a physical presence in Illinois. The plan also eliminates a “safe harbor” exemption for businesses that move money outside the state.

Businesses that move profits to other countries would also be subject to the state’s corporate income tax. The federal government currently taxes half of income moved offshore and Illinois would tax the other half under the revenue plan.

Businesses outside Illinois that sell $100,000 or more to people in the state must also collect Illinois sales taxes even if the business doesn’t have a physical location in Illinois. This would apply to businesses like Amazon.

“I will not support this betrayal of hard-working Illinoisians,” Sen. Don DeWitte, R-St. Charles, said. “And if you care about the people who sent you here, if you truly represent them, you’ll vote no too. Enough is enough. It’s time for this body to stand with taxpayers, not stand up against them.”

Another source of new revenue is a delinquent tax payment incentive program designed to help the state recuperate overdue tax payments. It will generate $228 million, Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago, said.



[caption id=""attachment_69376"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1140""] State Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago[/caption]



The state would also pause the final transfer of motor fuel sales tax revenue to the road fund in order to free up $171 million, according to the governor’s office’s estimate.

A separate bill designed to lower prescription drug prices calls for levying a fee on pharmacy benefit managers based on the number of patients they insure. Money from that fee would go into a fund for the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to award up to $25 million a year in grants to independent pharmacies and pharmacies located in rural counties. The remaining money would go to the state's general revenue fund.

The measure also extends the state’s Hotel Operators’ Occupation Tax to short-term rentals like Airbnb and Vrbo.

Immigrant health cuts

A controversial program that provides health insurance to more than 30,000 noncitizens between ages 42 and 64 will be cut in FY26. The program’s elimination saves the state $330 million, but a $110 million program for seniors will remain in place.

Together, the two programs have cost the state at least $1.6 billion, according to an audit released in February, far exceeding budgeted costs for the program.

""We had to make some tough decisions here. That program grew at greater rates, financially, than we thought it would, and we had to make some hard decisions,” Gabel said.

Federally Qualified Health Centers are set to receive $40 million in the budget. The centers provide health services to low-income and uninsured people. Democrats touted that increase to provide care for immigrants who would have qualified for the health care program.

Illinois still risks losing some Medicaid funding under a proposal in Congress that threatens to slash reimbursements for states that provide health insurance to people illegally in the United States. But Gabel noted it’s possible those reductions won’t take place until 2027.

The budget also increases funding for safety-net hospitals with federal Medicaid funding cuts possible. 
Education spending

The state’s evidence-based funding model for K-12 schools calls for $350 million in additional funding each year, with a portion of that going to a property tax relief fund and the rest directly to schools. The proposed budget fully funds the K-12 education portion at $307 million but does not add $43 million in property tax relief funds, according to Democratic leaders.

Funding for the Illinois Community College Board would also decrease by $24 million, mostly because lawmakers reduced spending on a workforce development grant that Democrat leaders said was not being fully utilized.

Funding for state universities  would only increase by 1%. Pritzker proposed a 3% increase for higher education even as most other areas of his budget would’ve increased by 1%. Senate Democrats’ budget leader Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, said the budget allows for an additional 2% increase in FY26 if the federal government eliminates substantial funding.

Pensions

Despite more than a year of discussions, Illinois lawmakers did not tackle pension reform this spring. Illinois' Tier 2 pension system is likely out of compliance with Social Security’s “safe harbor” law that requires pension benefits to be at least equal to Social Security.

Part of the budget package created a new Tier 2 reserve fund that can be accessed if there are violations of the “safe harbor” law. Lawmakers appropriated $75 million for the fund this year, in line with Pritzker’s proposal.

‘Emergency’ fund, raises, more

Notably not in this year’s budget is an increase to the “rainy day” fund. Pritzker has taken pride in the fund’s increases in recent years, as it’s grown to a balance of $2.3 billion, up from less than $60,000 when Pritzker took office. The FY26 budget would suspend the monthly transfer for one year, freeing up $45 million for general fund use.

The budget package also establishes a new $100 million fund that the governor can tap into “in the event of unanticipated delays in or failures of revenues.” The measure, an apparent nod to the uncertainty of federal funding amid ongoing congressional budget negotiations, will come from money swept from other funds.

“That will allow us to respond to actions by the federal government and challenges that present themselves and costs that have been diverted from the federal government to the state government,” Sims said in a committee hearing.

The attorney general’s office would get $116 million from the general fund. Attorney General Kwame Raoul asked lawmakers to boost funding for his office as he engages in a growing number of lawsuits against the Trump administration. Raoul was hoping to receive $120 million in funding.

Direct service providers are in line for an 80-cent per hour wage increase, but Republicans said calling it a funding increase is “sleight of hand,” because the measure would also reduce work hours for DSPs by the hundreds of thousands. That makes the increase negligible, Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, said in committee.

“It’s not a great budget, but it is a good budget and it is the budget we need for this very difficult moment,” Rep. Lindsey LaPointe, D-Chicago, said.

Lawmakers will see their salaries rise as part of the budget, going to a $98,304 base salary from roughly $92,000. That’s an annualized rate of increase that is set by law.

“You raised our pay, you gave yourselves hundreds of millions of dollars of our taxpayers funds to spend on your pet projects,” Rep. Amy Elik, R-Godfrey, said. “So I simply don’t believe you anymore that you ever intended to be fiscally careful.”

No Bears stadium funding

Lawmakers did not appropriate funding for the Chicago Bears to build a new stadium. But NASCAR would be the recipient of a $5 million grant ahead of the sport’s third downtown Chicago race in July, and the PGA Tour would receive a $1 million grant as part of hosting the 2026 President’s Cup in DuPage County. Those were two economic development measures criticized by Republicans during the Senate committee hearing.

The budget also contains $200 million to prepare unused state properties to be repurposed for development, Sims said. Lawmakers removed another $300 million that Pritzker had sought in spending  aimed at offloading surplus property.

Gabel said the state’s employee management department has negotiated more than $100 million in health care cost savings as well.

Any remaining federal pandemic relief funding would also be sent to recipients that have not received payments in previous years before the funding expires in 2026.

But a larger, child tax credit for middle-class families will have to wait at least another year, according to the compromise reached Saturday between Gov. Ned Lamont and leaders of the legislature’s Democratic majority.
“I’m very pleased to have arrived at this compromise that will deliver tangible relief to some of the Connecticut families that are struggling most mightily,” Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said.
Connecticut has about 195,000 households that receive the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program to help the working poor cover basic needs and increase savings. The state credit is worth 41.5% of the federal EITC’s value, meaning it adds an average of $1,061 to a qualifying household’s Connecticut income tax refund, according to nonpartisan analysts.
Couples with three or more children had to earn less than $66,819 last year to qualify for the EITC, according to the IRS. Other limits for couples were: $62,688 for those with two kids and $56,004 for those with one.
Single parents of three or more children had to earn less than $59,899 to qualify. Other limits for singles were: $55,768 for those with two kids and $49,084 for those with one.
Any EITC-eligible filers with children or other dependents would receive an additional $200 based on Saturday’s compromise. That amount would not vary regardless of the number of dependents claimed. Most EITC-eligible households have children, and while legislators didn’t release precise numbers Saturday, analysts estimate the new benefit would cost the state $26 million per year.
The administration’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, confirmed Saturday evening that “Governor Lamont supports this agreement that continues the progress to make Connecticut a more affordable place to live and work.”
The child tax credit was the last major issue blocking legislators and Lamont from compromising on a new state budget, which the House and Senate both are expected to adopt before the 2025 session closes Wednesday.

Connecticut is the only state with a broad-based income tax but no provision that recognizes the cost of raising children. Many Democrats favored a $600-per-child credit, with a maximum benefit of $1,800 per household, available to low and middle-income families. The relief package was projected to cost more than $300 million per year.
At first glance Connecticut easily could afford this. The state has closed the past seven fiscal years with an average surplus of $1.8 billion. Analysts project a $2.4 billion cushion for the current budget, which closes June 30, and expect the state to save at least $1 billion annually through 2028.
But state officials are wary of forfeiting revenue. Proposed federal Medicaid cuts are expected to cost Connecticut hundreds of millions of grant dollars annually, possibly as soon as next fiscal year.
Given those concerns, legislative leaders scaled back the proposed child tax credit to $150 per dependent, lowering the annual cost to about $83 million.
But there were other complications.
Democrats wanted a “refundable” child tax credit. Even if a household earns so little it has no income tax liability to reduce via the credit, $150 per child still would have been added to its refund.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, generally has opposed using state taxes to redistribute income, saying that should occur at the federal level. He did compromise with Democrats three years ago to make Connecticut’s EITC rate one of the highest among states.
The governor instead favors broadening eligibility and increasing from $300 to $350 an existing income tax break that mitigates the municipal property tax bills for about 870,000 filers — chiefly from the middle class — each year.
“We had a property tax credit [proposal.] They like a child tax credit,” the governor said early Saturday afternoon during a visit to the Capitol. “Maybe we’ll marry them in some way and get a rebate out to people in need.”
Lamont’s proposal, which also will not be included in the next budget, would have cost $85 million per year, roughly the same cost as a $150-per-dependent child tax credit.
But legislators and the governor also used several maneuvers to work around the state’s Constitutional spending cap, including moving hundreds of millions of dollars outside of the formal budget to finance future investments in child care services.
Democratic legislators, who have been pushing for a child tax credit for the past four years, are expected to resume their battle in 2026.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said his caucus members have “intense passion” for the credit.
And Horn said lawmakers are confident the EITC dependent program will bring real benefits to thousands of families and only intensify support going forward for a child tax credit.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)When Utah Democrats gathered at Ogden High School for their organizing convention on Saturday, the school hallways loudly echoed the voices of 600 delegates registering and debating whether an established politician or a newcomer had what it takes to transform red districts into blue after the departure of Diane Lewis, who had been in the role for the last four years.
Ultimately, that was decided by thin margins, when 52% of delegates voted Brian King to be the new Utah Democratic Party chair, a choice that reflected the party’s desire to trust widely known names to support its goal of gaining prominence in bright red Utah. 
“This isn’t just some abstract policy debate. What we’re talking about is happening right now,” King said during his pitch. “It’s parents losing their Medicaid coverage. It’s students being told what they can’t study. It’s immigrants being detained without due process and deported. It’s workers picking up the tab while billionaires cash in.”
King, who was a state representative from 2009 to 2024, when he quit to run for governor, highlighted his experience, saying he has been in the party long enough to know the dedication and planning needed to achieve its goals. He has also raised money and has cultivated important relationships across the state.
Utah Democrats to choose between seasoned legislator and young campaigner as new leader

 
He also committed to getting his hands dirty and filling up his calendar to show real progress.
“I’ve been able to stand on the House floor and say to the Republican supermajority, call them out for what they are, extremists who are out of touch with the values of Utah,” King said. “I took on the governor on the fake stage, and I told the truth. I said, ‘He’s not a leader. He’s a lapdog for the legislature.’”
In a statement after his win, King commended the convention’s turnout, saying it was a demonstration of Utah Democrats’ energy, motivation and readiness to fight for their values.
“This is a new era and this is our moment. As chair, I’m ready to lead the charge to hold out-of-touch Republicans accountable, to connect with voters across the state and political spectrum, and to flip seats from the top of the ballot to the bottom,” King said. “Monopolies, in politics and otherwise, aren’t good for anyone and Utahns deserve better.”
The day started early with caucus meetings, as cars filled up the school’s parking lot and neighboring streets. While it’s not an election year, delegates were fiery as party leaders and candidates mentioned some of the flagship policies the Republican Party has implemented in the state’s Legislature and, most recently, since President Donald Trump took office this year — immigration, Medicaid cuts, book bans and controversial culture war issues.
From the prayer to the candidates’ speeches, Democrats expressed profound concerns on the political status of the country under Trump’s direction, with some describing it as “being at war.”

While about 600 delegates showed up in person for the convention, 1,450 voted with the availability of digital ballots — a record number, the party said in a news release.
Tara Benally, who traveled with her mom from the Utah portion of the Navajo Nation in San Juan County for the convention, said she hoped to get more representation in rural areas out of the leadership change.
“Not many people are aware of what’s happening today or what’s going on within the state, because a lot of information stops somewhere along the way and just doesn’t get disseminated,” she said.
Especially, she added, when tribes are so deeply concerned with the status of public lands, the expansion of extractive industries, and the transportation of uranium through their neighborhoods.
“What is being done to help resolve a lot of the emergency issues that have been brought? What has been done to help monitor the air quality? A lot of these things we hear up in the Wasatch Front, but have not come down to our area,” Benally said. “When is that going to happen?”

A couple of hours before the voting started, the candidates made their pitches to delegates, with King arguing that the choices they made on Saturday would define the state and the party for years to come, as many started to pay attention to real impacts of policy coming out of the White House and the Legislature. 
Ben Peck, a young campaigner and former executive director of the Salt Lake County Democratic Party, highlighted his track record running campaigns that led to the election of Democrats including Natalie Pinkney in a tight race for the Salt Lake County Council, Sheila Srivastava, the first woman elected to serve as Salt Lake County treasurer, and Rosalba Dominguez, a freshman Utah House representative.
“Our democracy is facing an existential crisis. We need a party that acts like that. We don’t have time for part-time leaders anymore. We need a leader of our party whose full-time job is being the leader, building our party,” Peck said. 
Other candidates for the role, Archie Williams III and Jonathan Lopez, also made their case, however, but fell well below King and Peck in the in-person support.
The party also voted to approve a platform highlighting values they hope to lift up, including economic security, equality of opportunity, investing in the common good, and American leadership. Additionally, it overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning efforts to extend presidential tenure beyond two terms, as well as denouncing mass workforce reduction and benefit cuts in the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Jim Clyburn’s World Famous Fish Fry, an annual gathering of South Carolina Democrats, on Friday, May 30, 2025. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA, S.C. — Minutes before 10 p.m. Friday, after Democratic speakers led the audience in jeers to Republicans’ efforts to slash jobs and health care, and encouraged people to get involved and vote, line dancing broke out.
That mix of politics and fun, mostly the latter, is what makes Rep. Jim Clyburn’s (D-S.C.) annual fish fry in the state’s capital city so popular, attendees said.
“We all came out, and everybody’s enjoying themselves,” said Shantell Zimmerman, 58, of Columbia.
“It brings out the community,” agreed Dionne Brown, 55, of Irmo, who’s been attending the event for six years. “Then we actually get to discuss our views and takeaways.”
Hundreds of people attended the event that started in 1992, the year voters first elected Clyburn to the 6th Congressional District, as a thank you to the voters who couldn’t afford the Democratic Party’s high-dollar fundraisers.
Over time, the “World Famous Annual Fish Fry” — which includes free food and drinks — has become a must-attend event for Democrats seeking local, statewide and national office.
This year was no different, even if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — said they’re not running for the 2028 nomination.
“I know I’m not running,” Moore told reporters Friday. “But the thing I’m also very clear about is that anyone who’s talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously.”
Moore and Walz, as well as Clyburn and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison of Columbia, emphasized the importance of focusing on what’s happening now in Washington, D.C.
Proposed cuts to government safety nets like Medicaid and billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to rapidly slash federal spending were among the topics the governors touched on Friday during speeches at the fish fry, as well as the state Democratic Party’s Blue Palmetto Fundraising Dinner the same night.

“I taught school long enough to know it’s because they’re weak and they’re bullies, and when you stand up to them, they fade away,” said Walz, a former high school geography teacher.
While both declined suggestions that they’re running for president, there’s wide speculation otherwise. Their addresses at the events in South Carolina — which last year got promoted from holding the Democratic Party’s first-in-the-South to first-in-the-nation presidential primary — sounded a lot like campaign speeches.
Walz will also speak Saturday at the state Democratic Party’s annual convention.
Lucy Owens, an Anderson County delegate to the state convention, discounted the governors’ refusals, saying the 2028 presidential campaign has clearly begun.
“They’re all going to come through here. They’re the first ones,” she said of Moore and Walz.
In 2019, the fish fry drew more than 20 potential candidates hoping to appeal to South Carolina Democrats.
The following year, Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, a victory that ended up vaulting him to the presidency. South Carolina’s primary was elevated for 2024 as Biden’s thank you to the state.
With Biden gone, the Democratic party in flux, and Harrison no longer leading the national party, South Carolina maintaining its first-in-the-nation status is in question.
Clyburn’s comments Friday suggest he knows it won’t. He doesn’t care if the state is first, just that it’s early, he said.
“The most important hitter on a team is the cleanup hitter. He comes in fourth place,” Clyburn told reporters at his event. “I’m not concerned about whether or not we’re first, second, third. Please, let us be at least four.”
That would take South Carolina back to having the first primary in the South.
In the aftermath of Trump’s landslide victory and the Republican Party gaining control of both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party is in a reset. Walz and Moore, the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, are among the early faces of it.
Winning South Carolina, which changed the trajectory of Biden’s 2020 presidential run, will be crucial for Democratic hopefuls.

Owens, the Anderson County delegate, pointed to the stage where Walz and Moore spoke, saying every Democrat who wants to be president will eventually appear in that exact spot.
“They got to come through here. Not South Carolina. They got to go right there,” she said.
Both governors received raucous ovations from South Carolina Democrats, drawing cheers, standing ovations and even a few laughs as they took shots at the GOP.
Owens said “they’re both very great candidates,” and she’s “excited” to hear more from them over the coming years.
That was the general consensus from attendees who spoke with the SC Daily Gazette. But they were significantly more familiar with Walz because of his time on the campaign trail last year with Vice President Harris.
“I know less about Wes Moore than I do about Tim Walz, but I think he’s a good speaker,” said Laura Lowery, a 69-year-old from Fountain Inn. “I think he’s done a good job in his state as well.”
Moore has recently come under fire for vetoing a bill that would establish a commission to examine state and federal policies from 1877 to 1965 and come up with recommendations for reparations.
South Carolina Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, had asked the state party to remove Moore as the keynote speaker at Friday’s Blue Palmetto Dinner because of the veto. Party leaders never responded to questions about that request.
But for at least some attendees, the veto perturbed them too. “I didn’t understand why he would do that,” said Tonya Winbush of Anderson.
But once Winbush, a 50-year-old Army veteran, heard Moore speak about his time in the Army, as well as his pardoning of 175,000 people with convictions for cannabis possession, her opinion changed.
“I think when you don’t know the whole story and you just listen to sound bites, which is what we do a lot, we’ll make brash judgments about people, when we are really fighting the same fight,” she said.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Game and Parks Commission)LINCOLN — One of Nebraska’s oldest trees has died, and officials are blaming drought conditions.
The “Old Wolf Oak,” a burr oak with a 9.8-foot circumference located along a hiking trail at Ponca State Park, was estimated to be more than 380 years old.
The tree was a popular stop for park visitors, given that it was 223 years old when Nebraska became a state in 1867 and was a silent witness to the Lewis & Clark Expedition of 1804-06.
But Nebraska Game and Parks Commission officials say drought conditions in eastern Nebraska have created large areas of dead or declining mature trees, including the stately oak.
The past two years have seen extreme drought across Nebraska, officials said. While native species like the bur oak are drought-tolerant, prolonged drought causes dieback in the canopy and root systems, weakening tree defenses.
This creates an opening for pests and pathogens, officials said, and makes a tree more vulnerable to infection.
Game and Parks staff had been monitoring and, where possible, treating bur oaks for bur oak blight, which can weaken a tree. Officials also identified a new threat to trees, hypoxylon canker, a fungus that invades the vascular systems of drought-stricken trees and dooms a tree.
The old oak will soon be cut down under a response plan developed after consulting with experts, Game and Parks announced. Infected material must be destroyed on-site, officials said, to avoid stressing the surrounding healthy trees.
A sign at the Wolf Oak, erected in 1964, states that it “began its life in 1644.” But more modern dating techniques later added another half century to its age.
Ironically, it was not a state champion tree in its category. A registry kept by the Nebraska Forest Service lists a burr oak with a circumference of 18.7 feet near Peru as the state champion.

Using flawed studies and scientific journal publications, abortion opponents are building a body of research meant to question the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, a key target for the movement.
The effort comes as federal officials have expressed a willingness to revisit the drug’s approval — and potentially impose new restrictions on a medication used in the vast majority of abortions.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

Mainstream medical researchers have criticized the studies, highlighting flaws in their methodology and — in the case of one paper published by the conservative think tank Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) — lack of transparency about the data used to suggest mifepristone is unsafe. The vast body of research shows that the drugs used in medication abortion, mifepristone and misoprostol, are safe and effective in terminating a pregnancy.
“There’s a proliferation of anti-abortion propaganda right now. I think it is a coordinated attack on mifepristone,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco who studies medication abortion.
Released in April, the EPPC paper suggests that mifepristone results in serious adverse events for 1 in 10 patients — substantially higher than the widely accepted figure of .3 percent complication rate most research has attributed to the pill. The paper appears to count what other researchers say are non-threatening events, such as requiring follow-up care to complete the abortion, or visiting an emergency room within 45 days of an abortion — even if the patient did not end up requiring emergency care — as serious adverse effects. That paper also did not go through peer review, a standard process for scientific research in which other scholars review a study’s findings and methodology before it can be published.
Another paper, a commentary piece published this week in the journal BioTech, challenges the commonly cited statistic that mifepristone has a lower complication rate than acetaminophen, or Tylenol, tracing the history of the comparison and arguing that it is mathematically flawed. The paper’s author, Cameron Loutitt, is a biomedical engineer by training and director of life sciences at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a research arm of the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America.

“My hope is that this paper sparks action in my peers in the research and medical community to more critically evaluate these unfounded claims regarding abortion drug safety,” Loutitt said in a statement.
Days later, a group of researchers from the institute published another study, this one arguing that emergency rooms are likely to identify medication abortions as miscarriages, which they say increases the risk of needing hospital care.
A miscarriage and a medication abortion are medically indistinguishable, and patients will sometimes visit an emergency room to ensure the drugs worked, or if they suspect possible complications. In places where abortion is illegal, patients may also tell health care providers they experienced a miscarriage to minimize their legal risk. Studies like the Lozier Institute paper suggest complications from medication abortions are being undercounted.
That study was rejected by another journal on April 12 before being published this week, noted Upadhyay, who had served as a peer reviewer in that rejection process. A similar paper written by many of the same researchers behind the Lozier Institute’s was retracted a year ago by the journal that published it, along with two others suggesting mifepristone was unsafe.
“They keep trying to publish the same junk science,” Upadhyay said.
James Studnicki, the Charlotte Lozier Institute’s director of data analytics, who led the second of its new anti-abortion papers and the study retracted last year, did not respond to a request for comment. But a spokesperson for the institute said the organization is challenging last year’s retraction through an arbitration process. This March, Studnicki said in a statement that the retraction placed “politics over publication ethics.”
These studies and papers all fall outside the scientific consensus. More than 100 studies over decades of research have found that mifepristone — and the medication abortion regimen as a whole — has a low complication rate and is very safe to use for abortions. Papers like these aren’t new, and their scientific accuracy has long been questioned. But the bevy of new reports and analyses comes at a moment when abortion opponents may have more influence in shaping public policy.

Mifepristone restrictions are a top priority for the anti-abortion movement. About two-thirds of all abortions in the United States are now done using medication. Even in states with abortion bans, pregnant people have increasingly turned to abortion medication, which they receive from health providers in states with laws protecting abortion.
Nationwide, about 1 in 5 abortions are now performed using telehealth; almost half of those are for people in states with bans or restrictions. Mifepristone is currently approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before a Senate committee that he has directed the Food and Drug Administration to review the approval of mifepristone, citing the EPPC paper specifically. Jim O’Neill, who is nominated for a deputy secretary role, has also said he is in favor of a “safety review” of the drug — a move that could result in new restrictions on how it is prescribed.
Meanwhile, physicians and researchers are highlighting the rigor of the FDA approval process.
“FDA approval of mifepristone must reflect the rigorous clinical evidence that has proven unequivocally that it is safe and effective for use in medication,” 13 reproductive medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said in a statement after Kennedy indicated the drug may undergo a new FDA review. “Mifepristone has been used for decades for abortion and miscarriage management by millions of patients, and complications are exceedingly rare, minor, and most often easily treatable.”
The International Institute for Reproductive Loss, an anti-abortion nonprofit, has explicitly prioritized the publication of research that supports restrictions on medication abortion. Presenting at an anti-abortion conference last September, that organization’s science director, Priscilla Coleman, highlighted strategies that she said could help result in the retraction of studies showing mifepristone’s safety, such as finding “agenda-driven, poorly developed and conducted studies published in peer-reviewed journals” and writing to journal editors. Coleman did not respond to a request for comment.
Though no scientific consensus has changed, anti-abortion lawmakers have rallied around the suggestion that complications are common. In a private Zoom meeting reported on by Politico, abortion opponents cited the EPPC paper as a potential tool to justify further restrictions on mifepristone — even while acknowledging that the report is “not a study in the traditional sense” and “not conclusive proof of anything.”
Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, cited the EPPC paper in a letter to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who had only a day before the report’s publication indicated openness to reviewing mifepristone’s approval if new evidence emerged.
“The time to act is now. It is time to revisit and restore the FDA’s longstanding safety measures governing mifepristone,” Hawley wrote. His office did not reply to a request for further comment.
“They’re producing this terrible ‘science’ because they don’t have any real science that backs them up. And all they’ve gotten from the administration is, ‘Yeah, we’ll study it,’”  said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who has advised state legislatures on crafting abortion-protetctive laws.
Through the courts and Trump administration, abortion opponents have pushed to reverse a 2021 FDA decision allowing mifepristone to be distributed via telehealth. In addition to calling for the in-person requirement to be reinstated, abortion opponents are asking for restrictions such as the dispensation of the drug to require three in-person visits, and for mifepristone to only be approved for use only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Many have also argued the drug should be taken off the market entirely.
The Trump administration said on the campaign trail that it would leave abortion policy up to the states. So far, there has been little indication from the federal government that such changes are imminent.
“Pills are kind of just spreading, as we predicted, without almost any restriction and so far the anti-abortion movement hasn’t figured out what to do,” Cohen said.

While Nevada’s elected leaders have expressed a commitment to addressing the climate crisis, a new proposal under consideration raises questions about our state’s priorities. The proposed expansion of Nevada’s film tax credit program, which would direct hundreds of millions of dollars in public subsidies to Hollywood studios, risks sidelining urgent environmental and climate needs. At a time when bold action is needed to protect our communities and natural resources, this approach feels out of step.
It’s abundantly clear that Nevada is in a climate emergency. Wildfires are burning hotter and longer, filling our summers with smokey skies. Land managers warn this summer could bring catastrophic wildfires. The Great Basin is drying, and Lake Mead is sitting at thirty percent full. Communities from Las Vegas to Reno are enduring extreme heat, toxic air, and prolonged drought, and hundreds to thousands of Nevadans are dying each year as a result. We have proposed projects to protect our public lands, prevent extinction, and invest in sustainable transit, but we’re told there’s “no money.”


The proposal would allocate $95 million in annual transferable film tax credits for 15 years beginning in 2028, expanding our already-existing tax giveaways. The proposal will kick into place in 2028, and yet we have no way to know what our fiscal situation will be at that point in time. Just think of the roller coaster ride the 2020’s have been so far, and the looming federal budget that could have sweeping impacts to Nevada’s fiscal viability. Meanwhile, extreme heat is only getting worse, the Colorado River and Lake Mead are only getting drier, and our special places are only becoming more threatened.




Our organization has spent years fighting for clean air protections, better public transportation, rooftop solar access, and the preservation of special landscapes like Red Rock National Conservation Area and Lake Tahoe. We’re constantly met with budgetary constraints, told to be patient, to compromise. And yet the same state that balks at funding protections for pollinators and soil health is ready to roll out a red carpet for corporate film giants.
Supporters of the film credit expansion claim it will bring jobs and economic growth, but as the independent economists at Applied Economics reported, the state would have a negative return on investment. States across the country have learned the hard way that film subsidies rarely pay off. Meanwhile, climate investments create durable jobs, foster resilience, and protect our future. Where are the investments for fighting wildfires, restoring wetlands, or public transportation?
If Nevada has hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, let’s spend it on the people and places that make this state worth living in, and ensure it will be livable in the next several decades, not on fleeting glitz and glamour. Let’s fund the transition to a clean energy economy, build transit-to-trails networks, restore our watersheds, and protect the wild lands that make Nevada extraordinary.
We have shelled out enough for corporations working against our interests. Why do we give tax handouts to the Boring Tunnel instead of funding mass transit? Why do water intensive data centers get huge tax breaks when we can’t get funding for water conservation? Why did we give millions of dollars to build the A’s stadium in the Las Vegas core when we can’t get funding for urban forestry and mitigating urban heat?
This proposed tax credit isn’t just a bad policy. It’s a missed opportunity to lead. Nevada should act in the best interests of those who live here, instead of enacting Hollywood handouts.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1421734795-scaled-e1732293900334-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-05-31 15:03:28.216641

A Kodiak man has been sentenced to jail for illegally transporting Alaska crab out of state. (Photo provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service)A Kodiak fisher has been sentenced to spend a year in jail for illegally shipping thousands of pounds of tanner crab, much of it infected with a parasitic disease, out of Alaska to Washington state, federal officials said.
The fisherman, Corey Potter, was also sentenced to two years’ supervised release following his jail term, during which he will be barred from commercial fishing anywhere in the world, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
The investigation was led by NOAA Fisheries’ Office of Law Enforcement. The sentence was imposed on May 13 by U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Burgess in Anchorage.
The case concerns tanner and Golden king crab harvested in 2024 in Southeast Alaska. Potter owned two vessels, one of them captained by his son, Kyle Potter, and the other by employee Justin Welch.
Rather than unload the crab catch in Alaska, as is required by state law, the three men kept the live crab in the vessels and took the catch to Washington state, passing through Canadian waters along the way. The motivation was to fetch higher prices for their catch, according to prosecutors’ documents.
At the time, according to evidence presented in court documents, the men knew that a large proportion of the catch was infested with Bitter Crab Syndrome, a parasitic disease that usually kills the crabs and renders their meat inedible. Bitter Crab Syndrome is not toxic for people, but infected crab meat can be bitter and eating it is likened to chewing on aspirin.
That evidence included text messages from other Alaska fishers who cautioned Potter and his son against bringing infested crab to market, with one expressing concerns that their actions would hurt the reputation and marketability of all Alaska crab.

	Bitter Crab Syndrome affects numerous species, and it is considered a possible contributor to the crash of Bering Sea snow crab and king crab stocks that led to an unprecedented string of harvest closures between 2021 and 2024. The main reason for the stock crashes, scientists believe, was the warmth in the habitat, which led to crab starvation. In the years leading up to the fishery closures, however, there was an increase in Bitter Crab Syndrome. The disease is linked to warming waters and climate change, according to scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Kyle Potter and Welch pleaded guilty last year. In October, Kyle Potter was sentenced to five years’ probation and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine; Welch was sentenced to three years’ probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine.
Ultimately, the loads of crab they delivered never made it to any market. They were seized by Washington state law enforcement officers and deemed unfit for sale or consumption. Of the Golden king crab, 42% of the catch was dead upon arrival; of the tanner crab, so much was infested that the entire load was disposed of in a landfill, federal officials said.
Potter pleaded guilty in February to two counts of violating the Lacey Act, the federal law that concerns transport of wildlife and fish across state lines. Prosecutors identified him as the leader of the scheme and therefore requested heavier penalties.
Potter, in a presentencing memorandum, asked for probation rather than jail time, arguing that his long career of fishing in Alaska has now ended and that at the age of 64, he is now financially ruined. “As a result of last year’s terrible crabbing season, which included the instant offense conduct, he has been financially destroyed. One of the boats involved in this offense was foreclosed on, and the other is believed to have been seized by the state. He has been reduced to relying upon family for assistance and has no viable means to support himself,” the May 6 defense memo said.
But prosecutors, who argued for 18 months imprisonment, said actions with the diseased crab fit Potter’s yearslong pattern of sloppy maintenance and unsafe behavior.
In their presentencing report, also filed on May 6, prosecutors listed numerous past problems with the vessels Potter owned. They have been cited for chronically leaking oil, broken down at sea – requiring crew members to be rescued – and sunk in different sites, the report said.
“The defendant’s track record as a vessel operator in Alaska is abysmal. He has shown a total disregard for the safety of his crew, the safety of Alaskan waterways, and the health of the marine environment,” the prosecutors’ presentencing report said.
Yet to be determined is the amount of restitution that Potter will be ordered to pay for the trafficked crab. The government is seeking $187,187 in restitution. A hearing on that subject is set for July 15.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1280_EvN4ANCaZ2z3.jpg,,,2025-05-31 14:04:12.317876

(Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Minutes before 10 p.m. Friday, after Democratic speakers led the audience in jeers to Republicans’ efforts to slash jobs and health care and encouraged people to get involved and vote, line dancing broke out.
That mix of politics and fun, mostly the latter, is what makes U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn’s annual fish fry in the state’s capital city so popular, attendees said.

“We all came out, and everybody’s enjoying themselves,” said Shantell Zimmerman, 58, of Columbia.
“It brings out the community,” agreed Dionne Brown, 55, of Irmo, who’s been attending the event for six years. “Then we actually get to discuss our views and takeaways.”
Hundreds of people attended the event that started in 1992, the year voters first elected Clyburn to the 6th Congressional District, as a thank you to the voters who couldn’t afford the Democratic Party’s high-dollar fundraisers.
Over time, the “World Famous Annual Fish Fry” — which includes free food and drinks — has become a must-attend event for Democrats seeking local, statewide and national office.
This year was no different, even if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — said they’re not running for the 2028 nomination.
“I know I’m not running,” Moore told reporters Friday. “But the thing I’m also very clear about is that anyone who’s talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously.”
Moore and Walz, as well as Clyburn and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison of Columbia, emphasized the importance of focusing on what’s happening now in Washington, D.C.
Proposed cuts to government safety nets like Medicaid and billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to rapidly slash federal spending were among the topics the governors touched on Friday during speeches at the fish fry, as well as the Blue Palmetto Fundraising Dinner the same night.
“I taught school long enough to know it’s because they’re weak and they’re bullies, and when you stand up to them, they fade away,” said Walz, a former high school geography teacher.
While both declined that they’re running for president, there’s wide speculation otherwise. Their addresses at the events in South Carolina — which last year got promoted from holding the Democratic Party’s first-in-the-South to first-in-the-nation presidential primary — sounded a lot like campaign speeches.

Walz will also speak Saturday at the state Democratic Party’s annual convention.
Lucy Owens, an Anderson County delegate to the state convention, discounted the governors’ refusals, saying the 2028 presidential campaign has clearly begun.
“They’re all going to come through here. They’re the first ones,” she said.
In 2019, the fish fry drew more than 20 potential candidates hoping to appeal to South Carolina Democrats.
The following year, Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, a victory that ended up vaulting him to the presidency. South Carolina’s primary was elevated for 2024 as Biden’s thank you to the state.
With Biden gone, the Democratic party in flux, and Harrison no longer leading the national party, South Carolina maintaining its first-in-the-nation status is in question.
Clyburn’s comments Friday suggest he knows it won’t. He doesn’t care if the state is first, just that it’s early, he said.
“The most important hitter on a team is the cleanup hitter. He comes in fourth place,” Clyburn told reporters at his event.
“I’m not concerned about whether or not we’re first, second, third. Please, let us be at least four,” he said.
That would take South Carolina back to having the first primary in the South.
In the aftermath of Trump’s landslide victory and the Republican Party gaining control of both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party is in a reset.
Walz and Moore, the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, are among the early faces of it.
Winning South Carolina, which changed the trajectory of Biden’s 2020 presidential run, will be crucial for Democratic hopefuls.
Owens, the Anderson County delegate, pointed to the stage where Walz and Moore spoke, saying every Democrat who wants to be president will eventually appear in that exact spot.
“They got to come through here. Not South Carolina. They got to go right there,” she said.
Both governors received raucous ovations from South Carolina Democrats, drawing cheers, standing ovations and even a few laughs as they took shots at the GOP.
Owens said “they’re both very great candidates,” and she’s “excited” to hear more from them over the coming years.
That was the general consensus from attendees who spoke with the SC Daily Gazette. However, they were significantly more familiar with Walz because of his time on the campaign trail last year with Vice President Harris.
“I know less about Wes Moore than I do about Tim Walz, but I think he’s a good speaker,” said Laura Lowery, a 69-year-old from Fountain Inn. “I think he’s done a good job in his state as well.”
Moore has recently come under fire for vetoing a bill that would establish a commission to examine state and federal policies from 1877 to 1965 and come up with recommendations for reparations.
South Carolina Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, asked the state party to remove Moore as the keynote speaker of Friday’s Blue Palmetto Dinner. Party leaders never responded to questions about that request.
But for at least some attendees, the veto perturbed them too. “I didn’t understand why he would do that,” said Tony Winbush of Anderson.
But once Winbush, a 50-year-old Army veteran, heard Moore speak about his time in the Army, as well as his pardoning of 175,000 cannabis convictions, her opinion changed.
“I think when you don’t know the whole story and you just listen to sound bites, which is what we do a lot, we’ll make brash judgments about people, when we are really fighting the same fight,” she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5517-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-31 14:04:12.317876

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A strange turn of events followed the arrest of Ramón Morales Reyes, a 54-year-old Mexican-born man, who was living in Milwaukee as he sought a U-visa — a type of visa available to victims of crimes. 
On Friday, advocates from Voces de la Frontera joined immigration attorneys representing Morales Reyes to dispute accusations made by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that Morales Reyes — who does not speak or write in English — drafted a neatly handwritten note in English threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump. Voces de la Frontera and Morales Reyes’ attorneys are calling for DHS to correct the record and clear his name.
The affair began on May 21, when Voces de la Frontera received a hotline call reporting a possible sighting of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Milwaukee. Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, said during the Friday press conference that one of the group’s “trained community verifiers” contacted local residents who confirmed the sighting and also provided video footage of Morales Reyes being detained. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“His vehicle was left on the side of the road, and using the license plate we were able to identify the owner and communicate with his family,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “Shortly after, Ramón’s daughter came to our office to seek help. We assisted her in completing a power of attorney and ensuring that her father received the essential medication that was critical to his health. We immediately contacted attorney Kime Adbuli, who has been representing Ramón in his ongoing U-visa case.”
Neumann-Ortiz explained that a “U-visa” is a form of immigration relief for crime victims who have suffered emotional or physical abuse and who have helped law enforcement or government officials in the investigation and prosecution of a crime. “It provides a temporary legal status, and a pathway to permanent residency,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “In the past, the Morales Reyes family had sought resources from Voces.” 
Days after the arrest, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem provided statements for a press release describing Morales Reyes as an “illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump.” Noem added, “this threat comes not even a year after President Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania and less than two weeks after former FBI Director Comey called for the president’s assassination.” 
Noem was referring to Comey sharing a picture on Instagram of sea shells arranged into the numbers “8647”, which “86” interpreted as slang for “get rid of” and “47” being a reference to Trump, the 47th U.S. president, NPR reported. Comey is now being investigated by the Trump administration. “All politicians and members of the media should take notice of these repeated attempts on President Trump’s life and tone down their rhetoric,” Noem said. “I will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of President Trump.”
The DHS press release included an image of the note, neatly handwritten in turquoise-colored pen and in flawless English. “We are tired of this president messing with us Mexicans,” it began. “We have done more for this country than you white people — you have been deporting my family and I think it is time Donald J. Trump get what he has coming to him. I will self deport myself back to Mexico but not before I use my 30 yard 6 to shoot your precious president in is (sic) head — I will see him at one of his big ralleys (sic).” The reference to “30 yard 6” may be an incorrectly written reference to 30-6 (pronounced as “30 odd 6”), which is a high caliber bullet for rifles.

Morales Reyes’ family says that it is impossible that he wrote the note. Described by his attorneys as a soft spoken,  hardworking and committed family man, Morales Reyes works as a dishwasher. He was described as coming from a rural part of Mexico where it’s common for people to have no more than a third-grade education. Morales Reyes had difficulty filling out paperwork, does not speak English and is not proficient in writing in Spanish. Neumann-Ortiz said that his family called Voces organizers, confirming that Morales Reyes had very little formal education, and could not read or write in Spanish. 
Since his arrest, Morales Reyes’ family has received death threats on social media. “They want his name cleared,” said Neumann-Ortiz. On the day he was arrested, CNN reported, Morales Reyes was questioned by detectives from the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), who suspected that someone may have been setting him up to get deported. Police were reportedly investigating jailhouse calls from a person who’d allegedly assaulted Morales Reyes during a September 2023 armed robbery. 
CNN reported that ICE agents were given a handwritten note by Morales Reyes with family-related information, and agents realized that the handwriting did not match. The questions surrounding the letter are reminiscent of those stemming from the arrest and deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was accused by the U.S. government of being a member of the El Salvadoran gang MS-13. President Trump held up pictures which had been altered to appear as though “M S 1 3” was tattooed on Abrego Garcia’s knuckles.  
Getting Morales Reyes deported would prevent him from testifying against the person in custody for allegedly attacking him, his attorneys said at the press conference.

Attorney Kime Abduli said there are due process concerns around Morales Reyes’ arrest, as it could interrupt his testimony as a victim in a criminal proceeding and  also impact his U-visa case. The specific visa process which Morales Reyes is undertaking “is really meant to offer protection to people who may be undocumented who are victims of crime in the United States,” Abduli explained. 
“It’s meant to encourage them to report those crimes, when they are victims of those crimes, to the authorities, and to cooperate in the investigation. Where a person may be undocumented and fearful of reporting these sorts of things, Congress basically established the U-visa to make it ‘safe’ for them to come forward with that information. As long as they’re cooperating with law enforcement, the U-visa is intended to offer some protection for that individual.” Obtaining a U-visa can be a very lengthy process spanning seven to eight years at a minimum, Abduli said. 
Attorney Cane Oulahan, who is representing Morales Reyes in his deportation proceedings, said that ensuring due process is his top priority. Oulahan said that a bond hearing is expected in the coming days, where he expects the government to argue “vigorously” for Morales Reyes to be deported. It’s likely that the accusations from Noem’s DHS will also be raised before the judge. 
Another controversial deportation in Milwaukee
The controversy and questions come as ICE attempts to expel another Milwaukee resident. Yessenia Ruano, a teacher’s aide in Milwaukee Public Schools, was ordered recently by ICE to return to her home country of El Salvador in a matter of days. This is despite Ruano having a pending visa application for trafficking victims, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
On Friday, the same day Voces and attorneys held a press conference about the Morales Reyes case, ICE ordered Ruano to get on a deportation flight on June 3. Ruano will leave behind her 9-year-old twin daughters, who are U.S. citizens. Ruano’s attorneys said that it appears that ICE is abandoning policies of waiting for processing of T and U visas, which protect people from deportation. Ruano has lived in the U.S. for 14 years, has no criminal record, has a valid work visa, and is employed at a bilingual public elementary school. She said she is hoping that a final legal filing could pause her deportation.

Ruano’s case spurred a flurry of condemnation from local Milwaukee officials. “Deporting valued members of our community who are raising and educating our kids, assisting law enforcement in their important work, and giving back to our neighborhoods should alarm us all,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley wrote on X. “These individuals are victims of a broken immigration system. The Trump administration told the country they were only going after ‘the worst of the worst’. But time and time again, we see them targeting the very people who contribute the most — our neighbors, our coworkers, or friends.” 
Crowley said that he is “deeply alarmed that our country continues to turn its back on our most vulnerable.” He went on to say that “by not standing up and protecting our neighbors, we’re not just failing them — we’re failing our entire community. Due process is under attack, and that should concern all of us in Wisconsin and across the country.”
Congresswoman Gwen Moore also released a statement, calling Ruano a “beloved member of her community,” and declaring that “deporting Yessenia will not make our country safer.” Moore said the deportation order “will only separate Yessenia from her children and her community while exposing her to danger she was forced to flee in El Salvador. Instead of making America a beacon of hope for people like Yessenia, this Administration’s focus is only pushing cruelty that demonizes immigrants.”
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) said that the Trump administration’s deportation of Ruano is “wrong and harmful.” Clancy said in a statement that Ruano had volunteered at her local Catholic parish, worked in her neighborhood school, and was taking care of her family.

Recent weeks have seen ICE and the Trump Administration focus more on Milwaukee. Since late March, at least four people have been arrested by immigration agents after attending regularly scheduled hearings at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Local officials denounced the courthouse arrests, only for Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan to also be arrested by federal agents for allegedly obstructing authorities by escorting a man sought by ICE from her courtroom into a public hallway.
“Yessenia is an asset to our community whenever she touches it,” said Clancy. “Our community and her daughters deserve to continue to have Yessenia with us here, and Yessenia deserves to continue to build a thriving life with her family in Milwaukee.” Clancy condemned ICE, saying the agency “continues to act arbitrarily and with cruelty. We must all do what we can to protect our neighbors from it.”

Some protesters in front of the Florida Capitol Friday evening had politics on their mind, while others told the Phoenix they were there because others, who had been detained or are scared to leave their homes, couldn’t be.

The protest drew hundreds of people, a day after Immigration and Customs Enforcement and state police raided a construction site in Tallahassee and detained many of the workers.
“There’s a lot of people who can’t be out here right now. A lot of them are scared to leave their house, so I gotta do it for them,” Luis Arreguin said.  
Arreguin moved to Tallahassee 10 years ago from Mayo, Florida, where people had more respect for laborers, he said. 
“Blindsided, corrupt,” Arreguin said of the raid. “They’re not doing it for right reasons but, whatever, it is what it is. All we can do is do this right here, what we’re doing. There’s a god up there, he sees it all, he knows what happened yesterday.”
Wearing a white button-up shirt, Arreguin sat quietly on a bollard in front of the Capitol, holding a sign reading, “IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOME HERE,” while others chanted, encouraged honking from drivers-by, and cheered for speakers.
“We’re not bad people,” Arreguin said, referring to “Mexicans, Hispanics, immigrants.” 
“This nation was built on immigrants. So, I don’t know what the hell happened in the last 10-20 years that we forgot,” Arreguin said. “Some of the greatest inventions that’s come out of this country have come from immigrants. It’s just the passing of the torch, man, you just gotta wait it out.”

According to ICE, “100+ illegal aliens” were arrested during the “targeted enforcement operation Thursday.” The agency said people arrested were from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and Honduras “to name a few.”
The operation was directed by ICE Homeland Security Investigations Tallahassee and assisted by Florida Highway Patrol, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals Service, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Internal Revenue Service, and Drug Enforcement Administration. 
Gov. Ron DeSantis, who called a special legislative session earlier this year to create laws cracking down on illegal immigration, characterized the raid as a “Major bust in Tallahassee!”
Ivette Martinez, a daughter of immigrants, traveled from Bainbridge, Georgia, to join the protest. 
“It’s inhumane,” said Martinez, whose husband works five minutes away from the construction site. “It could’ve been my husband.”
“My question is, we present a birth certificate, Social Security, a Real ID that we have, and they still be saying it’s fake,” Martinez said, concerned about cases such as one the Phoenix reported on in which a U.S. citizen was detained under the new immigration laws after showing his ID. 
“So what, me as a USA citizen, do I have to prove in order to prove that I am a USA citizen? If they don’t take my word, they don’t take my real ID, Social Security, or birth certificate, what else? Am I just supposed to let them detain me or fight back?”
After entering the construction site near the Florida State University campus, federal and state officials asked workers for identification and separated them into two categories, witnesses told the Phoenix. According to ICE, one worker during Thursday’s raid was charged with four counts of assault on law enforcement officers and another attempted to pull a weapon on officers.
Some were free to go; others were handcuffed and led onto white buses with metal-plated windows to be transported away from the worksite, escorted by the Highway Patrol. Officials, many masked, on the scene declined to provide information about the operation.
Construction workers who’d been allowed to leave told the Phoenix that law enforcement officers had surrounded the site on West Gaines Street in FSU-adjacent College Town before the raid began at about 9 a.m.

Kat Spiegel drove an hour and half from Jennings, Florida, with politics on her mind. 
“I’m here because Trump is dismantling our entire democracy. He’s trampling over the Constitution,” Spiegel told the Phoenix. “ICE is out of control and they’re running around, they’re not identifying themselves, we have no idea who they are, they’re masked, it’s disgusting, he needs to go.”
DeSantis posted to social media Friday that federal officials “are pursuing the subcontractor responsible for hiring the illegal alien workers…”
“These types of enforcement actions aim to eliminate illegal employment, holding employers accountable and protecting employment opportunities for America’s lawful workforce,” said ICE Homeland Security Investigations Tallahassee Assistant Special Agent in Charge Nicholas Ingegno in a news release. 
“HSI Tallahassee, working alongside our state, local, and federal partners, will continue protecting public safety by enforcing the immigration laws of our nation.”

‘Immigrants Make America Great’
Tony Alas, who works in construction, was at the protest with his family, holding a sign covered in stars and hearts that read, “Immigrants Make America Great.”
“They say we come here to steal. We’re not stealing anything. We’re just doing the job that nobody else wants to do,” Alas told the Phoenix.
“They say, ‘Come here, do it the right way.’ The immigration system is broken and they need to fix it,” Alas said. 
“Because sometimes it’s people with no papers and it’s not about money, it’s about your kin. Some of my friends, they had to go back. When you have a wife and kids, you don’t want to go back to your country and wait like, like, what? Three or four years, 10 years to get your papers straight? So you take the risk to stay with no papers.”
Tony Alas’ 19-year-old daughter Wendy, joined him.
“Me and my siblings, this country is all we’ve ever known. This country is where we grew up, we know everything here,” Wendy Alas said.
“It’s so heartbreaking, and I don’t know what I would do in a situation where my family or any of my other families like my aunts, my uncles, were sent back and I wouldn’t be able to see them again,” Wendy Alas said.

As the crowd formed and speakers aired concerns, protesters chanted, “One, two, three, four, immigrants are worth fighting for,” and, “Five, six, seven, eight, no more ICE in our state.”
“Say it once, say it twice, we will not put up with ICE,” they chanted, accompanied by drums and megaphones.
Groups involved in the protest included Tallahassee Immigrant Rights Alliance, Leon County Democratic Environmental Caucus, Young Democratic Socialists of America, Students for a Democratic Society, Voices United Gadsden, Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and Food Not Bombs
Protesters held up signs reading things like, “Abolish ICE,” “Due process for all,” “Let people work,” “No 287(g),” and “Melt ICE.”
“When our communities are under attack, we stand up and fight back. Politicians won’t help us, the people in power don’t want to help us, so we have to show them that we won’t stand for it and the people will rise up,” Joelle Nunez, an organizer with Tallahassee Immigrant Rights Alliance, said through a loudspeaker. 
“If they’re focused on gang members and drug dealers, why are they focusing on arresting people that are simply trying to earn a living for their family?” Nunez told protesters. 
Nunez, an FSU senior in biology, said she would ask politicians to “stop facilitating these immigration raids.”
“Florida, of all the states in the whole United States, has the most 287(g) agreements; we have a Immigration Enforcement Council now and, all in all, we’re not only taking Trump’s immigration policies in hand, but actually like stepping them up on the local level, and I think that’s not right. What we need to be seeing is a sort of, some type of opposition to the immigration policies,” Nunez told the Phoenix.

Justice Eric Rosen, from row left, wrote the dissenting opinion in the case raising questions about Fourth Amendment rights in searches and seizures. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Supreme Court photograph)TOPEKA — Wichita police officers Donald Bailey and Shawn Isham were watching a suspected drug house in 2020 when Gina Wilson parked a vehicle in the driveway, entered the residence, reappeared a few minutes later and drove away.
The officers followed Wilson before pulling her over on Greenfield Street, allegedly for twice failing to properly use a turn signal. Wilson denied committing the traffic infractions, but informed officers she didn’t have a valid driver’s license.
What happened next as Wilson stood on the curb with police officers was closely examined by the Sedgwick County District Court, Kansas Court of Appeals and Kansas Supreme Court. In the end, Wilson lost her bid to exclude evidence of a drug offense and the state’s highest court exposed a disagreement regarding constitutional rights of individuals subjected to searches and seizures by law enforcement.
On Friday, the Supreme Court’s majority opinion from Justice Caleb Stegall affirmed the officers’ compliance with the Fourth Amendment in terms of constitutionally conducting the traffic stop and deploying Oden, a drug-sniffing dog, to examine the exterior of Wilson’s vehicle. Wilson had refused to consent to a search of her vehicle. However, the canine alerted to presence of illicit drugs. A subsequent examination of the car’s interior by Wichita officers led to discovery of a packet of oxycodone pills.
Stegall concluded that because Wilson had no legal ability to drive the car away at conclusion of the traffic-related portion of the stop, officers didn’t overstep their authority by nominally extending the encounter to allow for the dog sniff. Four minutes elapsed between when the officers completed her traffic citation and the time Oden alerted to presence of drugs.
“Even though she was not under arrest, Wilson argues that because she was not free to leave during these four minutes, she was unconstitutionally seized as an extension of the traffic stop,” Stegall said in the opinion. “As such, she concludes that the search of the car was also unconstitutional and therefore the evidence gained from the unconstitutional search must be excluded.”
Stegall’s majority opinion argued Wilson’s suspended license created an unusual circumstance enabling officers to deploy the K-9 around her legally parked car that no one was attempting to move.
“Oden’s alert provided probable cause, which allowed the officers to perform a warrantless search of the car … and the pills were properly admitted into evidence,” Stegall’s opinion said. “Therefore, officers do not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment’s protections by performing a dog sniff of any vehicle that is legally parked in public.”
The dissent by Justice Eric Rosen, which was joined by Chief Justice Marla Luckert and Justice Melissa Standridge, said the drug evidence should have been suppressed because prolonging a traffic stop to complete the drug sniff without reasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment.
Rosen held the Wichita officers seized Wilson and the vehicle, extended the traffic stop, deployed Oden and discovered an envelope containing 30 oxycodone capsules in the car’s console.
Rosen expressed frustration the majority opinion “pronounces some new legal rules for which it provides no supporting authority.” He challenged the majority’s declaration that a vehicle directed to the side of the road during a traffic stop shouldn’t be characterized as seized by law enforcement.
“The majority likens this car to any car that was voluntarily parked in a public place,” Rosen wrote. “From here, the majority announces that officers can perform a dog sniff on any car legally parked in public.”
In 2022, Wilson was convicted of driving while suspended and illegal possession of opiates.
She unsuccessfully argued in district court for suppression of drug evidence while alleging the officers impermissibly extended scope of the traffic stop to create a window for deployment of the K-9 unit.
The Court of Appeals sided with the district court in 2023 after concluding there was “no evidence that the dog sniff meaningfully extended the duration of the original stop.” The divided Supreme Court affirmed Wilson’s constitutional rights weren’t violated.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kansas-Supreme-Court-members.png,,,2025-05-31 09:59:47.240990

For years, states have taxed hospitals and other health care providers to draw down federal matching funds and help finance their Medicaid programs. Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

(Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall)Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
 

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 
  Balanced markets 

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
  Help for teachers 

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Among Republicans, seven supported and eight opposed.The Nevada Assembly on Friday night approved what will likely be the state’s largest ever public subsidy: $1.4 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years to support a movie studio in Las Vegas.
Assembly Bill 238 passed the Assembly by a razor-thin margin: 22 in support, 20 opposed. The bill now advances to the Senate for consideration in the waning days of the legislative session.
The bill would massively expand Nevada’s film tax credit program to support the build out and operation of a 31-acre film studio currently referred to as the Summerlin Production Studios Project (after the Las Vegas neighborhood where it would be located). Hollywood giants Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery are attached to the project. Howard Hughes Holdings is developing.




How transferable tax credits cost the state money: A $50 million example
Transferable tax credits sell for less than face value — a discount of about 10% isn’t unusual.
Let’s say the state issues Sony $50 million of tax credits. MGM Resorts International buys them from Sony for $45 million. Then, instead of paying the state $50 million in gaming taxes that it owes, MGM gives the state the tax credits it bought from Sony.
MGM gets a $5 million tax break.
Sony gets $45 million.
And the state, which otherwise would have received $50 million in tax revenue from MGM, gets nothing.
— Hugh Jackson




Nevada’s film tax credit program is currently capped at $10 million per year. AB 238 would raise that cap to $120 million per year, for 15 years, beginning in 2028. The majority of those tax credits, $95 million per year, would be reserved for productions at the Summerlin studio; $25 million per year would be for productions not attached to the studio.
Altogether, that’s equivalent to $1.8 billion in public subsidies for the television and film industry. If approved by the Senate and signed into law by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, the legislation will be the largest public subsidy approved by the State of Nevada, surpassing the $1.25 billion approved by lawmakers in 2014 for Tesla Motors.
Democratic Assemblymembers Sandra Jauregui and Danielle Monroe Moreno, who sponsored the bill, have pushed back on the characterization of their proposal as a public subsidy for massive corporations, instead framing it as an investment in a new industry that will bring thousands of new jobs and new revenue to the state.
While tax credits aren’t issued to companies until they prove they’ve met the qualifications for them, the state must treat them as “negative revenue” when forecasting expected state revenue. That means they do impact the state budgeting process.
Opponents have argued that the return on investment is low. An independent analysis commissioned by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, which houses the Nevada Film Office, determined that AB238 would stimulate the state economy but not enough to offset the massive expansion of the film tax credit program.
An analysis commissioned by the backers of AB 238 offered a rosier projection, but even that acknowledged that most of the projected economic activity is indirect or induced.
An amendment adopted by the Assembly will create a special tax zone around the Summerlin film studio that captures some of the local taxes generated and diverts it to the Clark County School District to fund pre-k programs in East Last Vegas. Additional guardrails were also amended into the bill.
Support in the Assembly did not fall across party lines. Among the 27 Democrats in the chamber, 15 voted in support and 12 voted against. Among Republicans, seven supported and eight opposed.
The Summerlin studio bill received less support in the Assembly than the bill two years ago that approved $380 million in public assistance for a proposed baseball stadium for the Oakland A’s on the Las Vegas Strip. That bill passed the Assembly 25-15. (Two lawmakers were excused from that vote.)
Banking bill vote raises eyebrows
The razor-thin film tax credit bill vote was not the only dramatic moment in the Assembly Friday. Earlier in the floor session, Assembly Bill 500 fell short of the required two-thirds approval it needed to pass the chamber. The bill would have allowed for payment banks, a new type of financial institution that focuses solely on payment processing rather than lending.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, who sponsored that bill, believes the bill will create competition in the financial services industry and lower costs for businesses by cutting out financial middlemen.
The Assembly vote was 25-17, a simple majority but three short of the two-thirds it needed because it would raise state revenue. Six Democrats and 11 Republicans opposed the bill. Four Republicans and 11 Democrats supported the bill.
Immediately after the bill failed, a motion was made to reconsider the vote and move the bill to the chief clerk’s desk.
Yeager said afterward he wasn’t surprised by the outcome, adding that he wasn’t sure he had the votes it needed but decided “to put it out there and see.” 
He dismissed the notion that some Democrats may have withdrawn support after learning that the Nevada Firearms Coalition PAC was privately urging Republicans to support the bill, something Yeager and others in his caucus apparently did not know until it was reported by The Nevada Independent days earlier.
Yeager chalked up the vote to lawmakers being hesitant about complex financial banking legislation. He added that he plans on having “a few more conversations” about the bill on Saturday to see if another vote is possible.
Because of procedural rules, AB500 needs to pass the full Assembly on Saturday in order to have a chance at making it to the governor’s desk.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.












We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver




Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
New rules protect pregnant workers, but red states sue over abortion provisions

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s largest hunger-relief organization says it faces a $2.5 million budget shortfall next year because of President Donald Trump’s federal funding cuts.
Feeding South Dakota CEO Lori Dykstra addressed lawmakers on a budget committee Friday in Pierre. She said the group has already cut the amount of food it provides and has merged distribution sites. She warned that unless the funding gap is filled, 21 food distribution events in 15 counties will be eliminated, affecting 3,400 families and eliminating more than 1.7 million meals annually.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


“We’re not here to say whether or not the federal funding decisions are right or wrong,” Dykstra said. “We’re just letting you know that one of the unintentional consequences is that the food safety net for Feeding South Dakota and for all of your neighbors facing hunger is at risk.”
The cuts come from the rollback of federal aid by the Trump administration, particularly programs begun during the COVID-19 pandemic to help the U.S. Department of Agriculture support food distribution. 
Dykstra said the group must now find $2.5 million to replace lost USDA support in fiscal year 2026, which begins July 1, or make cuts. 
Dykstra also warned that if the current budget reconciliation legislation in Congress is enacted, the state could be on the hook for 5% of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and a larger share of SNAP administrative costs, adding up to a possible $13 million total state obligation. SNAP participants can use their benefits to purchase food.
“SNAP benefits get people out of food lines,” she said. “So, it’s either they’re in the food bank line or they’re in the grocery store.” 
Dykstra said 113,000 South Dakotans are food insecure, meaning they are uncertain about where their next meal will come from, often forced to skip meals, eat less, or purchase cheaper, less nutritious food.

Buildings were destroyed during the Tulsa Race Massacre when a white mob attacked the Greenwood neighborhood, a prosperous Black community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921. Eyewitnesses recalled men carrying torches through the streets to set fire to homes and businesses. Credit: Library of Congress
The Tulsa race massacre began after a white mob gathered at a jail where a Black teen had been arrested on false charges of “attacking” a white girl in an elevator. 
In reality, he may have tripped or bumped into her. Although authorities exonerated him, that didn’t stop the mob. 
“As the whites moved north, they set fire to practically every building in the African American community, including a dozen churches, five hotels, 31 restaurants, four drug stores, eight doctor’s offices, more than two dozen grocery stores, and the Black public library,” according to a 2001 report on the massacre. 
That rampage left as many as 300 dead and 10,000 homeless. “They tried to kill all the Black folks they could see,” recalled George Monroe, who was 5 at the time. The Black community known as Greenwood bore the name of the Mississippi Delta town. Greenwood, known as the “Black Wall Street” for its bustling businesses, became a pile of ashes. 
No one was ever prosecuted for these crimes. Viola Fletcher, a 107-year-old who survived, said, “I have lived through the massacre every day. Our country may forget this history, but I cannot. I will not. And other survivors do not. And our descendants do not.”

The Boeing 737 that he used to travel around the nation is now being used to deport immigrants. Records show that it has made at least 16 flights to Central and South American countries to deport immigrants this year.


Federal Fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference. Read the latest.


	An Arizona Mirror analysis of publicly available data and records obtained by the University of Washington through Freedom of Information Act requests confirms that the 22-year-old jet is part of the fleet of planes known as “ICE Air” that swiftly shuttles immigrants out of the United States. ICE Air consists of multiple charter airlines and other private aviation companies around the country that are contracted to move immigrant detainees inside and out of the country.
Even before the plane was emblazoned with the Trump campaign logo in July 2024, it had been used at least four times to transport immigrant detainees during an earlier stint on the ICE Air fleet.
Data analyzed by the Mirror and confirmed by University of Washington Center for Human Rights researcher Phil Neff show that the aircraft flew four ICE Air missions in April and May 2018.
Those four missions consisted of three removal flights to El Salvador and Guatemala, in which deportees were shipped off to those countries. The fourth was a transfer flight, in which detainees were moved from one ICE facility to another.
During those four missions in 2018, the aircraft carried between 456 to 504 passengers, according to ICE passenger data.
And records from 2020 detail 35 flights from known ICE hubs to Central and South American countries.
For example, on March 6, 2020, the aircraft took off from the Alexandria Airport in Louisiana, where ICE has a staging facility operated by private contractor GEO Group. It then landed at the José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador, before returning to Alexandria.
Earlier this year, that same airport was where military planes deported migrants.
Data on flights after 2018 are more difficult to confirm. ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security began redacting identifying information of the aircraft used in the deportation process, making it more difficult to see the movements of individual planes, though it is still possible in some cases.
In its response to questions from the Arizona Mirror, an unnamed “senior DHS official” said that the department would not confirm whether the plane had been used for deportation flights.
“ICE uses sub-contractors to help carry out its mission to deport illegal aliens,” the unnamed official said in an email. “These sub-contractors are not exclusive to ICE. For operational security, we will not confirm tail numbers of planes used for removing illegal aliens who are often violent criminals and foreign terrorists.”
Claims that most of the Trump administration’s deportees are violent criminals have been repeatedly proven false.
Civil rights groups have been fighting for records about the program, while the agency regularly slow-walks records releases.
“Our experience in general with FOIAs — not just with the Department of Homeland Security, but especially with the Department of Homeland Security — is you should expect to have to sue to get information and for us that process involves getting approval from the highest level of the university,” Neff told the Mirror. “So, we have had to be very selective in the case in which we have had to do that.”
Just five months after Trump and Vance won the election, the aircraft flew between multiple airports known for ICE Air activity before heading to an airport in Honduras known for deportation flights, then coming to rest at Mesa Gateway Airport.
It is not clear if Trump or Vance were aware of the aircraft’s history before it became part of their campaign. A spokesperson for the White House directed the Mirror to the Department of Homeland Security and Vance’s office. Vance and DHS did not respond.
 From ferrying travelers to deportees

The aircraft, N917XA, has a long and interesting history.
It started its life in the fleet of the now defunct Air Berlin before transferring to Orenair, another ill-fated airline based in Russia, until it was acquired by Swift Air.
Swift Air was a subcontractor for ICE and has previously conducted flights out of Mesa Gateway Airport, one of ICE’s major airport hubs. Flight history shows the plane has made multiple flights to and from Mesa Gateway to other ICE airport hubs, as well as to Central and South American countries.
A previous inspector general report listed the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway airport as the operational headquarters for ICE Air.
Swift Air rebranded as iAero Airways in 2019, but went bankrupt in 2024. Eastern Air Express acquired much of iAero’s assets, including N917XA, in April 2024. Three months later, it was unveiled as Vance’s campaign jet. Eastern Air Express has also taken over the ICE Air contracts that iAero held.
The company also has connections to the Trump world.
From 1989 to 1992, Trump owned an airline company called “Trump Shuttle,” which he purchased after meeting the Eastern Air Express CEO at a party. But the endeavor, like so many of Trump’s businesses, was financially doomed and failed.
 ICE Air activities heat up in Arizona

ICE Air operations in Arizona are beginning to ramp up as well, with Avelo Airlines starting to make deportation flights out of Mesa Gateway this month, amid financial woes and market competition.
Contracts to conduct deportation flights are lucrative for the companies involved. The Project on Government Oversight has reported that CSI Aviation, whose corporate director was a “fake elector” in New Mexico for Trump, was awarded a no-bid contract to the tune of $128 million.
Neff said he wasn’t surprised to learn that the aircraft that had been used for deportations had been used by the Trump campaign, although he did say there was an “irony to it.”
During their research, Neff said they found that some of the contractors would often boast about how they could turn aircraft around from passenger style to luxury style on short notice, even finding aircraft that had previously been used for deportations later being used to shuttle professional sports teams or musicians around the country.
Immigrant advocates have been critical of the flights and say they raise a number of human rights and civil rights issues. Neff said those concerns are only being exacerbated by the Trump administration’s push to speed up deportations.
“I think it is really impossible to overstate or understand the true scope of human impacts of a deportation program on this scale,” Neff said.
During their initial research, which covered flights between 2010 and 2020, Neff said they found a “significant portion” of the passengers being deported still had cases that had not worked their way through the courts. The Trump administration has recently been defending its use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans, to do rapid deportations.
Once on the planes, immigrants are shackled at their feet and hands for the duration of the flight. In testimony in a class action against the United States, passengers were shackled for 23 hours sitting on the tarmac and some soiled themselves as they were denied access to the bathroom.
Abuse on ICE Air flights have been reported going back to 2016, when some passengers were left bloodied after being beaten and placed in body-bag style restraints. In some cases, deaths and miscarriages have been reported on ICE Air flights.
And transparency about the flights is getting worse, Neff noted.
While the first round of data obtained by researchers contained information such as flight destinations, flight costs, and the tail numbers of aircraft, the government redacted that information from future releases.
While public flight history data are available to researchers, those researchers are working overtime to help track these flights.
“It is 8 or 10 hours, 7 days a week. It is a significant amount of time,” immigration activist Tom Cartwright, who has been voluntarily tracking ICE flights since Trump’s first term, told the Mirror.
During that time, Cartwright has noticed that tracking the aircraft has gotten considerably more difficult, as federal agencies have sought to stymie watchdogs from monitoring the program by removing their aircraft from flight-tracking services.
But Cartwright and others have still found other ways to keep a watchful eye on the program.
“The transparency has gotten worse over time and worse under the [second] Trump administration,” Cartwright said, adding that taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent. “To send some of these flights with relatively few people on them at a million dollars a flight seems pretty ridiculous, to be honest.”
The coming weeks and months are likely to keep Cartwright busy, as deportation flights have been ramping up. In the last couple of weeks, Cartwright said he has noticed flights have “accelerated quite a bit,” and he said is anticipating May to be a record-breaking month for total flights.
Cartwright said his work is important because it sends a message to those on the flights — and those their deportation left behind in America.
“The people on the planes deserve the dignity of someone giving a damn,” he said. “All these people on these planes, they have mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles. They deserve the dignity of someone understanding that they are being sent away to somewhere that, in some cases, they haven’t seen in years or somewhere that is dangerous or where they won’t be able to support their family.”

Jermaine Johnson, D-Columbia, pictured on the South Carolina Statehouse grounds on Sept. 18, 2024 (File/Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — After five sessions in the state House, Rep. Jermaine Johnson might make a bid for the Governor’s Mansion.
The Columbia Democrat announced Saturday he’s forming a committee to assess support and engage with voters statewide, which is considered a step toward launching an official run.
“From expanding economic opportunity and improving education to advocating for criminal justice reform and protecting working families, I’ve stood side-by-side with South Carolinians through every challenge,” Johnson said in a press release. “Now, I’m exploring what it would mean to take that work to the Governor’s Office to serve all of the people of South Carolina.”
The father of four — who turns 40 on July 4 — did not offer a timeline on his decision. Filing for the June 2026 primaries isn’t until mid-March.
Johnson is the first Democrat to announce interest in seeking the job as the state’s CEO.
He recognizes it would be an uphill battle for any Democrat in South Carolina.
No Democrat has won the office since Jim Hodges in 1998. The last Democrat to win any statewide office was Jim Rex in 2006, when he became state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
“South Carolina is at a crossroads,” Johnson said. “We need leadership that listens, leads with integrity, and puts people before politics.”
No Republican has officially announced a bid for governor, but six have said they’re considering it: Lt. Gov. Pam Evette, Attorney General Alan Wilson; U.S. House Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman; and state Sens. Josh Kimbrell and Sean Bennett.
The race is wide open since Gov. Henry McMaster can’t seek another term. He’s already the longest-serving elected governor in state history, since he ascended to the job in January 2017 — when Nikki Haley became President Donald Trump’s first United Nations ambassador — giving him two years in office before his first inauguration.
Regardless of whether Johnson decides to make a gubernatorial run, he said he “wholeheartedly plans” to still run for re-election to the state House seat representing parts of Richland and Kershaw counties.
South Carolina law allows candidates to seek more than one office at the same time. They just can’t hold multiple offices simultaneously. If they win more than one in an election, they have to make a choice.
Johnson first won a seat in the Statehouse in 2020, when he ousted 22-year veteran Rep. Jimmy Bales in the Democratic primary. Two years later, the elections gave Republicans a supermajority in the chamber. The 2024 elections gave the GOP a supermajority in the Senate too.
That doesn’t stop Johnson from making sure his colleagues know where he stands. And even if Republicans have no intention of supporting his argument, they listen.
“For years, I’ve worked to uplift our communities — not just with words, but with action,” Johnson said in the release.
During the chamber’s May 7 debate on the roughly $14.5 billion state budget, he put up 37 amendments to protest a decision by the chambers’ chief budget writers not to fund any local projects, known as earmarks, this year. All failed, but he ensured his colleagues knew more about some of the projects they were dismissing.
Three weeks later, as the House voted on the final budget deal, Rep. Joe White brought up Johnson’s fight while scolding his GOP colleagues. The Newberry County Republican noted he voted for Johnson’s first amendment.
“He put up some good amendments, and what did we do?” said White, a member of the uber-conservative Freedom Caucus. “We ran roughshod over every one of them.”
His comments also show that Johnson’s well-liked across the political spectrum.
“I love Jermaine,” White said.
Johnson, born in Los Angeles, has a compelling life story, which became the subject of a documentary titled “I Got Myself a Yard,” released last fall.
Homeless in his teens, Johnson earned a basketball scholarship to the College of Charleston.
His 1,276 points still rank 21st in program history and led to a spot in a developmental league for NBA prospects before stints playing professionally in Canada, Portugal, Mexico and Brazil.
After his basketball career, he returned to South Carolina, starting New Economic Beginnings Foundation, a nonprofit aimed to aid troubled children and military veterans.

The Sleeping Bear Dunes have been active systems for millennia, shifting with the weather or fixed by vegetation. But changes can seem sudden, especially when measured against human infrastructure.
That was the case with a popular wooden viewing platform at the Lake Michigan Overlook’s stop #9 along Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive in Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.
The platform rested on the dune some 450 feet above the lake. When National Park Service staff arrived at the site this spring, they found some of its pilings were no longer touching the ground. Winter storms, wind and rain had eroded the sand underneath.
“The western portion of that overlook was freestanding. It was free-hanging. The sand had moved on,” said Scott Tucker, superintendent of Sleeping Bear Dunes.
Tucker estimated roughly half a million people visited the stop every year. Some would venture out onto the platform.
Now, it’s gone.
Staff dismantled it earlier this month because it wasn’t safe.

Why do the dunes do that? As the glaciers retreated at the end of the Ice Age, they shaped this area’s geography. Wind and water have changed the lakeshore and the dunes along it for millennia. But human-caused climate change is also influencing erosion in the Great Lakes. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, warming temperatures contribute to lower ice cover and water levels, which in turn can make coastlines vulnerable to erosion and flooding.

 Underneath the park’s Facebook post announcing the news, people reacted with stories and memories of past visits, from engagements to shared moments with loved ones who have passed away.
The platform was installed in 1986, further back from the edge of the dune and firmly anchored in the ground.
But in the nearly four decades since, the dune has retreated. Tucker said in a given year, the dune face moves about 1 to 3 feet east, away from the lake.
These dunes move with the prevailing winds. In this case, the sand is being blown from the overlook and deposited across the Sleeping Bear Plateau, said Tom Ulrich, a former deputy superintendent of the park who retired about a year and a half ago.
“The dunes are inexorable,” Ulrich said. “They will move, and you cannot stop them from moving, and you’re foolish if you think you can.”
It’s been a chaotic time for national parks. The Trump administration froze federal hiring earlier this year before lifting it for the National Park Service in March. Many federal employees have lost their jobs, left, or been caught in a state of limbo since January. And the proposed federal budget, which narrowly passed the House, would mean major cuts to the agency.
Sleeping Bear Dunes has around two-thirds of the staff typically there this time of year, according to the Glen Arbor Sun and WLUC-TV.
Tucker, the superintendent, didn’t elaborate. “It’s a very complex system right now, and I’m really focused on opening up the lakeshore for the summer,” he said.
As for the future of the overlook, he said, in 2028 the park will look at planning and design for that location as part of a five-year recreation fee plan.
The Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive was the last area of the park to open for the season. And while the platform is gone, people can still visit the stop along the drive and take in the vast landscape.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan) Last week, by a single vote, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.” 
This is sweeping reconciliation bill that promises to reshape the American social safety net. At the heart of this legislation are more than $700 billion in cuts to Medicaid, a program that serves as a lifeline for tens of thousands of Montanans with disabilities. 
Medicaid pays for some of the most basic services many people with disabilities need to get by each day, like the basic personal care supports someone with a physical disability may need to get out of bed in the morning, the more intensive skill training and safety supervision someone with an intellectual disability may need to learn to live more independently, and it pays for medication to maintain a person’s mental health and more intensive community supports when they have mental health emergency. For Montanans with disabilities, this bill is not just a policy shift – it’s a direct threat to our lives.
The bill imposes new administrative hurdles, including requiring Medicaid recipients to reverify their eligibility twice a year. For people with disabilities – many of whom already navigate complex bureaucracies – this change increases the risk of losing coverage due to paperwork errors or missed deadlines. Here in Montana, we know this isn’t a mere possibility, it was our reality. In 2023 and 2024, Montana required Medicaid recipients to submit paperwork to verify their continued eligibility.  When Montanans tried to follow the rules to verify their eligibility, they found the state’s phone lines were left unanswered and many people were kicked off for administrative reasons without ever looking at their clinical need.  
Though the bill includes exemptions, these are often poorly implemented. In practice, people are misclassified, denied exemptions, or fall through the cracks due to inaccessible systems. People with legitimate disabilities are stripped of their health care and there is a big administrative burden on the individual and the state eligibility system to sort through wrongful denials and terminations. When Arkansas implemented work requirements in 2018 similar to the work requirements in the new federal reconciliation bill, more than 18,000 people lost coverage, many of them wrongfully, and there was no meaningful impact on employment.
At Disability Rights Montana, we have been here for 50 years serving the disability community and we hear from people every day who rely on Medicaid to live independently, to work, to go to school, and to participate in their communities. These are veterans with PTSD, children with autism, adults with spinal cord injuries, and seniors with dementia. Defunding disability services is a major step backwards in history to a time when people with disabilities were excluded from society and warehoused in poor institutional conditions. This bill sends a clear message to people with disabilities that their lives are not as valuable as tax cuts for the rich. 
Even if you don’t have a disability or don’t use Medicaid, you will feel the cuts. It is well known in health care circles that even Montanans who don’t rely on Medicaid for their insurance coverage will feel the effects of this bill, especially in rural communities. For example, this year the state legislature heard from hospital administrators and healthcare providers who explained the impact Medicaid expansion has had on our state. It has allowed rural hospitals to add or expand specialty services like orthopedic surgery and mental health care. Without this funding, these services may disappear and that will affect all patients, not just those who are covered by Medicaid. Hospitals and other health care providers serve the rich and poor alike. When the money for poor people goes away, so do the therapists, nurses, and doctors that money paid for. If you lose funding to cover portions of health care professionals’ salaries, those positions go away completely because you can’t hire 60% of a doctor in a rural hospital. 
The bill is now before the Senate. Given the slim political margins there, Sens. Daines and Sheehy could cast deciding votes. Budgets are moral documents. Just a couple months ago, the state legislature decided the moral choice was to maintain a robust Medicaid program for Montana. Now Senators Daines and Sheehy must answer the same moral question. What will they do?",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Medicaid_3-1024x780.jpg,,,2025-05-31 07:03:42.948041

Brad Little signed an executive order establishing eight weeks of guaranteed paid leave for eligible employees of Idaho’s executive branch agencies following the birth or adoption of a child. In 2024, Little signed an executive order to provide eight weeks of parental leave to state employees who foster a child.

The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.












We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver




Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
 Keeping talent in the workforce

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.

 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

The old Kitty Clover building, as locals know it, has undergone a multimillion dollar renovation on its 3.5-acre site south of downtown. And a chunk of the 85,000-square-foot facility has been transformed into a co-working hub for artists.
Instead of 16,000 bags of chips daily, the building built in 1952 and rebranded as “Clover24” — a nod to its history and the main corridor on which it sits — is, at least for now, producing original thread paintings, pottery and other crafty products. 
 Boings, bowls, little people

Among the first 18 creative tenants is Diane Mattern, who kiddingly calls herself a “weird welder” whose work is seen regionally in the form of spiraled steel “boings” and other distinct concrete garden and indoor sculptures.
There’s Letha Goldsmith, an art therapist who uses magazine pages and glue to sculpt colorful bowls and containers and also incorporates figures of little people into various other art pieces.

Studio mate Amy Robertson’s creative bent is fiber art and thread painting, while neighbor comedian Todd Graves describes his multidisciplinary art forms as “unapologetically offbeat.”
They’re open for business in a structure that, for the first time in decades, offers a public-facing side. For example, a three-day open house and free inaugural group exhibition showing work of more than 90 local artists, including Therman Statom and Watie White, wraps up at 7 p.m. Saturday, May 31. 
Featured is Bart Vargas, whose art has been shown worldwide. His pieces will remain on display through July, along with work of other resident artists. 
Bob and Ilaamen Pelshaw, a husband-and-wife team that started and manages the artist co-working project, said they plan to host future events, in addition to opening doors daily for customers.
“We’re building community,” he said. “We want to celebrate the artists that live in the Omaha area.”
Ilaamen, herself an artist and illustrator with a studio at Clover24, said word quickly traveled, and the initial wave of available studios filled. 
“It shows demand,” she said.
 NE pandemic recovery funds 

The couple’s effort to offer a South Omaha spot where startups could create and show wares has had ups and downs. Their grand vision proposal was among 367 North and South Omaha applications vying a few years ago for a state grant from federal pandemic-related funds. The Nebraska Legislature earmarked and state officials awarded about $235 million for economic development projects for the areas disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.

State officials ultimately awarded the Pelshaw Group $50,000, much less than the $10 million requested. Those dollars have been directed toward a narrower slice of the plan, a job-preparedness program for Nebraskans transitioning from incarceration. 
The couple eventually turned to a different building site and a downsized plan, working now with Heinson Enterprises, which has owned the old Kitty Clover structure since the 1990s. A spokesman for the family-owned enterprise said it saw potentially new and greater use amid the growth of business, residential and recreational activity in and around the downtown of Nebraska’s largest city.
Artists who are situated mostly on the main level — in former administrative office suites turned studios that cover about 11% of the building — have signed leases that give them or the owner the right to terminate at any time, offering flexibility for both sides. 
“We’re in startup mode, testing the market to determine what is the highest and best use for the facility,” said spokesman Kyle Fowler. “They’re testing us out. We’re testing them out.”

Brokers Seth Campbell and Conner Dana of Campbell Dana Commercial Real Estate continue to seek one or more industrial users for the expansive lower level, and possibly a section of the main floor.
So far, the owners have invested roughly $4 million in a new roof, modern facade and building infrastructure. Depending on future uses, Fowler said, more renovations could be ahead.
The Pelshaws hope to add even more creative tenants, including a barber and a tattoo artist, and say the parking lot is an alluring amenity. They envision an outdoor sculpture garden starting with an uncommissioned J. Doe that will be adorned with historical mementos honoring the site’s previous chapters. 
 Slanted wall, industrial vibe 

While Ilaamen’s career launched in her homeland of Guatemala, it has advanced in Nebraska and during a three-year stint at long established Hot Shops Art Center in Omaha’s north downtown. Tenants consider Clover24 to be a mini version of Hot Shops, where artists feed off each other’s energy and often work collaboratively.

For Bob Pelshaw, who grew up in South Omaha, he hoped to provide a supportive and financially accessible space for area entrepreneurs. He recalls as a kid going outside and soaking in the smell of potato chips being made.
Both he and his wife said they appreciate the industrial vibe and unique spots throughout Clover24 that offer ways to be creative.
One of the studios has a slanted wall, interesting for hanging art. Another has curves for corners. There’s the “chip fryer gallery,” the “brick gallery” and an eclectic bathroom Ilaamen decorated with mashup portraits combining traits of art greats Andy Warhol and Bob Ross.
Said Ilaamen: “We want love in every corner, fun places everywhere you go.”

(Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Imagine you’re a veteran in Wheat Ridge, or a single mom in Lamar living with chronic pain. You’ve finally found something that works: a legal, plant-based supplement that helps you stay off opioids. But then, just as things start to stabilize, the state passes a law that could complicate how you access it.
That’s what just happened to thousands of Coloradans. On Thursday, Gov. Jared Polis signed Senate Bill 25-72 into law. We appreciate his commitment to public safety and consumer protection. But this law makes things more confusing, not safer. For the people who rely on kratom-derived products to manage pain or recover from addiction, it’s a major step backward.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I’ve worked in public policy for over 20 years, and I represent the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust (HART), a nonprofit advocating for science-based kratom regulation (to be clear, we don’t sell or profit from these products). We’ve been trying to get rules in place that protect consumers and reflect real-world use for years. This bill doesn’t get us closer to that goal.
Kratom is a plant-based supplement long used in Southeast Asia and now increasingly used here in Colorado. One of its natural compounds, 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH, is found in products that patients say have helped them avoid returning to painkillers or heroin. Especially in rural and low-income areas, where access to traditional treatment can be limited, these products can mean the difference between stability and relapse.
In 2022, Colorado’s own state feasibility study laid out a clear, science-backed path for regulating these products. It advocated setting dosage limits, requiring testing and labeling, and establishing strong oversight. But SB-72 doesn’t follow that roadmap. It was rushed through in the final days of the legislative session and now leaves Colorado with a fragmented and unclear system. Safe products could be sidelined while dangerous ones remain on shelves.
Consider the facts:

Claim: The bill bans unsafe high-potency products.
Reality: It doesn’t. The most dangerous products — high-mitragynine shots and kratom/kava blends — are still on shelves. Meanwhile, safer products made by responsible companies are pushed out.
Claim: It regulates 7-OH.
Reality: The law sets a 2% cap on 7-OH but excludes anything above that threshold from regulation altogether. That leaves patients, businesses, and law enforcement in regulatory limbo.
Claim: It adds safety and labeling rules.
Reality: The bill makes only minor changes for kratom and none for 7-OH, even though that’s often the compound patients rely on most.

There’s also been public discussion tying this bill to the tragic death of Daniel Bregger. We deeply respect his family and their advocacy. But the facts matter: At the time, 7-OH products were not commercially available. Using that tragedy to justify this law distracts from the real dangers SB-72 fails to address.
The law now excludes many 7-OH products from the definition of a “kratom product,” but offers no clarity on how they should be regulated. 7-OH remains legal in Colorado, but SB-72 creates confusion instead of guidance. That helps bad actors more than consumers. Retailers don’t know what they can sell, patients don’t know what they can trust, and law enforcement doesn’t know what to enforce.
We want regulation. In fact, the brands we work with already follow many of the rules this bill should have required, such as limiting dosage based on science, testing products, and labeling ingredients. These are basic protections. But SB-72 doesn’t ensure they’re followed by everyone. It’s a major missed opportunity.
Colorado has built a national reputation for bold, evidence-based leadership on cannabis, psychedelics, and public health. SB-72 doesn’t live up to that legacy.
But it’s not too late.
Let’s come back to the table, this time with patients in the room. We can still build a framework that’s clear, fair and focused on safety. Colorado can still lead. We just have to choose to.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Each day now in Lawrence, where my family and I live, I watch the clouds roll in and the rains come.
The spring storm season thunders and flashes and pours, and the lawns flourish and gutters overflow. I sit here in my home office through the evenings and watch as the lightning casts strange shadows. I hear the rain pelting the roof. Later on, when I take our dog out for a walk, the rains have usually slowed and the neighborhood smells earthy and damp, while the doused roads shine under streetlamps.
During these days, my son hangs around the house. School has ended, and summer activities remain a few weeks distant. He plays video games and dotes on the pets. My husband’s work has shifted into its busiest season, so some days I only see him toward the end of the day.
I seem to live now, for a week or two at least, in a small protected bubble. The rains come and the world rumbles and my son and I stay indoors and wait for the storm to pass. Aren’t many of us doing that right now, staying in those kind of bubbles, waiting for the skies to clear? We can create those bubbles in different ways. Some of us watch seasons of old situation comedies, following the adventures of Sam and Diane and Cliff and Norm on Cheers (rest in peace, George Wendt). Some of us watch horror movies (I enjoyed Nicholas Roeg’s “Don’t Look Now” the other night). Some of us find escape through exercise or alcohol or other activities that change our brain and body chemistry.
It is the season of survival.
We endure the weather. It’s different for all of us. Here in Kansas, the weather might be a private prison company pressing to reopen facilities to serve Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. It might be a law that denies critical yet misunderstood health care to teenagers. It might be your immigration status if you study at a university. It might be an uncertain economic climate that threatens small business in towns and cities.
In uncertain times, we search for comparisons. We judge today’s storm against the storms of the past. We survived those, we tell ourselves, so surely we must survive these ones. Those storms may have even been worse, we tell ourselves. We should expect spring rains, Discover Magazine explains, as humid summer air collides with dry winter air. The mixture forms clouds, yields precipitation.
We still wait indoors, swaddled in decades-old quilts and drinking hot tea.
The metaphor strains. My correspondents will write me email messages insisting that determined Kansans can weatherproof their homes. We can work together to find community and purpose during these dreary, overcast days. We need not — must not — hide from the work ahead of us.
I understand these things, agree with them, have written them before. We can both endure and act. The stormy season will pass. These times will end. The clouds will clear and the sun will nudge itself above the horizon, and we will pick up the pieces. I will mow the lawn and pick up the random branches that fell from the giant tree in our front yard. Cleanup awaits, and it will take the whole subdivision pitching in.
Yet while spring storm season continues, at least let me have these gloomy evenings. Let me embrace poetry and fiction and imagination leaps. Grant me the time to recharge, to dote on my family, to enjoy distractions for a handful of days. We all deserve time to center ourselves, to feel protected from the inevitable deluge.
These moments of grace will steel us for a long, hot summer.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Democrats are calling for clarity in the state’s abortion law as the case of Adriana Smith continues to grab headlines worldwide.
Undiagnosed blood clots in Smith’s brain left the 30-year-old nurse brain dead months ago, but doctors have kept her organs functioning through medical devices. Family members told media outlets Smith’s body was being kept alive despite no chance for her to recover because she is pregnant and removing her from life support could violate the state’s ban on most abortions after six weeks.
Georgia’s top lawyer disagrees with that interpretation of the law.
  Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr speaks at the Georgia Chamber of Commerce’s Eggs and Issues event in Atlanta early in the 2025 legislative session. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” Attorney General Chris Carr said in a statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.’”
But a public statement does not come with the force of law, said Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, a Duluth Democrat, and when it comes to the practice of medicine, legal gray areas can lead to tragic outcomes.
Speaking at a press conference Thursday at the state Capitol, Islam Parkes called on Carr to issue a legally binding opinion to answer a series of questions she said would spell out when doctors could treat a pregnant woman in a way that could harm or kill the fetus: Is a hospital legally required to maintain a brain dead pregnant woman on life support? What precisely constitutes a medical emergency under the law? Under what conditions does a pregnancy meet the threshold of incompatibility with life? How does the law affect legal standing of advanced directives and end-of-life planning for pregnant Georgians?
“These questions are not theoretical,” Islam Parkes said. “They’re urgent, because as long as this law remains vague, we will continue to see families traumatized, providers criminalized and patients left behind. Doctors are being forced to make impossible choices, families are trapped in grief and fear and women are dying.”
Islam Parkes was referencing two high-profile deaths, Georgians Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, who both died in 2022 after suffering complications from taking abortion pills. Thurman died in a hospital after doctors waited nearly a day to perform a routine procedure to remove fetal tissue from her uterus; Miller died after family members said she was afraid to seek medical care because of the recently enacted law.
Democrats said there are likely more cases that do not end in death.
  Kaycee Maruscak said the pain of experiencing a miscarriage was exacerbated when she could not receive treatment for more than a week because doctors were skittish of potentially violating the state abortion law. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
of Gwinnett said she had already picked out a name for her unborn daughter, Sawyer Nicole Christian, but in March, a day after Maruscak held a gender reveal party, she discovered her daughter’s heart had stopped beating.
“In a matter of seconds, we went from preparing to welcome her into our lives to trying to figure out how to say goodbye,” she said at the Capitol press conference. “My doctor was sympathetic, but because of the restrictive abortion laws, my care was limited to a list of abortion clinics. No follow-up plan, no guidance and no support. Over the next two days, I called clinic after clinic, continuously having to repeat and relive that Sawyer did not have a heartbeat. My insurance recommended me to go to the emergency department because of increasing septic symptoms, so I did. I spent seven hours there in pain, in grief, and in shock, only to be discharged with no treatment, no resolution and no care.”
Maruscak said she spent more than a week carrying her daughter’s remains.
“What happened to me is not rare. It is not an outlier. It’s happening every day,” she said. “One in four women experience a miscarriage. Over half of them need medical intervention to complete it safely. This is not just a political issue, it’s a medical one.”
Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones made no bones about the party’s ultimate goal of repealing the six-week abortion ban, which went into effect in 2022 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion and left the matter to states.
“As that fight continues, we must stand with and demand clarification from our governor and attorney general,” Jones said. “What rights do women have under this law? Georgians have been asking this question. We as legislators have been asking this question and the people standing here today have been asking this question, yet Georgia’s leadership has stayed silent.”
  Sen. Ed Setzler. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The author of Georgia’s abortion bill, Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler, accused Democrats of playing politics in an attempt to drum up headlines.
“My heart goes out to Adriana, her family, and the young son inside of her who is struggling for his life,” Setzler said. “Nabilah Islam Parkes and the Democrats are sickening at the depths they will go to drag Adriana’s hurting family, who is trying to save the life of their grandson, through a sick political debate about expanding abortion.”
“The Democrats are making attacks as loudly as they can to try to seize media attention,” he added.
Conservative radio host and Georgia Life Alliance board member Martha Zoller said tragic cases like Maruscak’s are not the result of the state’s abortion ban – sometimes referred to by supporters as the “heartbeat bill” – but of hospitals misunderstanding or misapplying it.
“Once you’ve had a miscarriage or you’re in the process of a miscarriage, there is no heartbeat, so there should be no reason for care to be withheld or anything like that,” she said. “That’s the over-legalization of the medical care business with not allowing providers to be providers and to do what’s best for patients. And that has nothing to do with the heartbeat bill. That has to do with the structure at the hospital. The care for a miscarriage is not denoted as something that’s a method of abortion in the heartbeat bill, and once you’ve had a miscarriage, there is no heartbeat, so the heartbeat bill doesn’t come into play.”
“It’s a travesty that the Democratic caucus continues to mislead women and scare them for their own political purposes,” she added.

Sears/Maryland Matters)When you wake up Sunday, it will be harder to collect damages from the state for child sexual abuse and easier to find relief at a pick-your-own farm, new rules will start the long process of slowing utility rate increases and a new law will again delay the start of a paid family and medical leave program
And chromite will be the official state mineral, a fact you can toast with the new official state cocktail, the orange crush.
Those are the most notable of just over 100 new laws that take effect on June 1, many of them duplicates. They range from local alcohol and bond bills to a severe retrenchment of a 2023 law on damages for victims of child sexual abuse that could have left the state open to billions in legal expenses.
It’s the first batch from the 849 bills from the 2025 General Assembly that have been signed into law, most of which will take effect on July 1 or Oct. 1.
But this first batch included some significant legislation, the most high-profile of which may have been House Bill 1378 which overhauls the Child Victims Act that passed to great fanfare just two years ago.
Racing to the courthouse to beat new law
Attorneys in and outside of Maryland spent the last week rushing to courthouses around the state to file claims for victims of institutional child sex abuse, working to beat the June 1 law that will cut potential awards in half and make it harder for victims to make multiple claims.
“Since this law was enacted by the legislature, even before the governor signed it, our firm has been devoting, — I’m not even exaggerating to say — probably about 80-plus percent of its time, energy efforts and resources, into getting these lawsuits filed,” said Emily Malarkey, a partner in the Baltimore firm Bekman, Marder, Hopper, Malarkey & Perlin.
In the last six weeks, Malarkey’s firm filed 50 lawsuits on behalf of 250 clients, just one firm among many representing potentially thousands of clients. One case came in at 10 p.m. Thursday, from an out-of-state firm that needed local attorneys to assist in filing.
“We’re exhausted,” Malarkey said. “It has been a Herculean effort, that was never our intended plan.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Those numbers are part of what drove lawmakers to pass the bill dramatically limiting a two-year old law that allowed victims who were otherwise barred from suing because of time limits to file civil lawsuits. The 2023 law created a scenario in which state and local governments could be on the hook for billions in potential liabilities.
Under the old law, damages were capped at $1.5 million per “occurrence” of abuse in a lawsuit against a private institution such as a school or church. In cases involving government entities, the cap was $890,000 per occurrence.
The new law slashes the caps as of June 1 — to $700,000 for private institutions and $400,000 for public institutions. And the “per occurrence” language goes away.
Lawmakers rushed to address the issue after legislative analysts warned in January that, under the old caps and with the potential of more than one occurrence per claimant, the cost to settle more than 3,100 cases that had been filed at the time could run into the billions. That would be troubling in good economic times, but the January warning came as the state was looking at an existing $3.3 billion structural deficit for fiscal 2026 and a similarly sized one for fiscal 2027.
The new law not only has financial consequences for victims. It could also limit the number of future cases, as lawyers consider whether they can afford to take on clients under the new caps.
“After June 1, it’s going to be really hard, I think, to find good representation, because not only did the legislature cut the cap, but the legislature cut the attorney fees that can be charged,” Malarkey said. “It’s going to be very difficult for businesses like mine to handle these complex, expensive, difficult cases stemming from decades ago, with dead witnesses and lost documents on a 20% contingency fee. We just can’t do it.”
Thousands of cases are pending in Maryland courts.
Malarkey said the vast majority — cases against the Archdiocese of Baltimore and the Department of Juvenile Services — will likely work their way through Baltimore City Circuit Courts. Prince George’s County courts will likely see the bulk of cases against from the Catholic Church’s Washington diocese. The rest, including cases against local schools and other institutions, will be heard in counties around the state.
What price power? New law doesn’t have quick answer
The Next Generation Energy Act that takes effect Sunday passed with just as much fanfare and will be felt by virtually every Marylander — but with none of the urgency of the Child Victims Act overhaul. The most immediate change, a rebate on people’s electric bills, won’t come before July.
In fact, the only noticeable change on June 1 is likely to be another increase in utility bills, while the law aimed at reining increases in grinds to life.

Senate Bill 937 and House Bill 1035 were part of a three-bill energy package touted by Democratic leaders in response to rising utility bills over the winter that blew up legislators’ phone lines and email inboxes with constituent complaints. The bills’ backers said the measures included short-, medium- and long-term solutions to complex issue of rising energy costs in Maryland.
The first change Marylanders will notice is the “Legislative Energy Relief Refund,” a credit averaging $80 per household that will be divided between bills next month and in January 2026. But the next round of rate increases is set to kick in after June 1.
Baltimore Gas & Electric customers got a break Thursday when the Maryland Public Service Commission ordered the utility to take next month’s expected $21 per month increase and spread it over several months, lowering the increase by $10 to $15 for the average household during the summer months. But rates will jump in September — overall, BGE customers will pay the same amount, but it will be spread out more evenly.
Customers of other utilities are likely to see increases between $4 and $18 per month, according to a report commissioned by the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel.
Meanwhile, most of the bill’s provisions will unfold farther into the future.
The law includes changes at the PSC meant to rein in utility spending, including on new natural gas infrastructure, and encourage the construction of new power sources and energy storage technology — all with the goal of slowing price increases for ratepayers.
It calls for the PSC to open a procurement window — in October — for generators of “dispatchable” energy, which must contribute a certain amount of reliable energy to the grid with lower greenhouse gas emissions than coal or oil, according to the bill. It could include new natural gas, an option that angered environmentalists. The PSC will open another procurement window in January, for battery storage technology.
Environmentalists were pleased that the bill removes a renewable energy subsidy from trash incinerators that generate power, long one of their goals.

	Republican critics said the bill will do little to bolster in-state power generation, and blamed Democrats for driving fossil fuel power plants out of business and pushing costly clean energy policies on utilities. In fact, experts say the rate increases are caused by a combination of factors, from rising energy demand, to policies of regional electric grid operator PJM, to utilities pursuing overzealous improvements to the natural gas system.
Another bill in the Democrats’ package, which takes effect July 1, prevents local governments from banning large solar panel facilities through zoning. House Bill 1036/Senate Bill 931 raised concerns in farming communities, who worry that productive farmland could be lost to solar panels, but it’s not clear they will be able to meet a weekend deadline to petition it to referendum.
The final bill, to set up an energy planning office focused on the state’s long-term energy picture, was vetoed by Gov. Wes Moore (D), who said that other offices do that already and that it was too costly.
Delay for FAMLI, disappointment for immigrants
At least one new law does nothing — for another 18 months. The Family and Medical Leave Insurance program was supposed to start on July 1, but House Bill 102 defers the start of the program until Jan. 1, 2027. And that’s just the date when payroll deductions and employer contributions would start to be collected for the programs, benefits for someone who needed to take time off for a family issue of a health emergency would not start to be paid out until Jan. 1, 2028.
It is the third time the program start date has been pushed back since the FAMLI law was approved by lawmakers in 2022. Passage of the bill was a bitter pill for advocates, who said family emergencies can’t wait 18 months. Moore administration officials said the delay was unfortunate. But they also said that with the state facing a $3 billion budget deficit at the start of this year, and with continued uncertainty coming out of Washington under the  Trump administration, another delay was the only prudent thing to do.

The Maryland Values Act, meanwhile, does something, but it’s a lot less than its backers had hoped. As drafted, House Bill 1222 would have prohibited “287(g)” agreements, under which local police can essentially act as immigration agents, detaining people on suspicion of immigration violations and holding them for federal agents. A handful of sheriff’s departments in the state have entered into 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Senators stripped out the 287(g) language from the House bill and the Senate was not budging as the clock ticked down on the session. With literally minutes left in the 2025 General Assembly session, the House relented.
The final version of the Maryland Values Act has nothing on 287(g) but does add protections against release of immigrants’ personal records and other data the state holds. It also includes language to help “sensitive locations” — churches, schools, hospitals and the like — respond should federal agents show up. Those locations had been off limits to immigration enforcement under the Biden administration, but that restriction was quickly lifted under the Trump administration.
Studying guns in schools, more
House Bill 782 requires a thorough assessment of guns in the state’s public high schools and middle schools, and report on the best way to detect the presence of guns in schools and the best way to report such information to police. The law will take effect just days after the first-degree murder conviction Friday of Jaylen Rushawn Prince, 16, in the shooting death of 15-year-old Warren Curtis Grant in a bathroom at Joppatowne High School on Sept. 6, 2024, according to news reports.
The bill, originally sponsored by Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard), calls on the Maryland Center for School Safety, a unit within the Maryland Department of Education, to meet with members of every local school system in the state and evaluate the security infrastructure currently in place. The center will also be required to evaluate “widely accepted” methods that are available but not currently used by school systems, analyze software that can be integrated with security cameras and study the use of metal detectors, even handheld devices, at school entrances.
The center will have to present an interim report to legislative leaders as well as to the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee by Dec. 1, 2025. A final report would be due by Dec. 1, 2026.
Other bills that become laws June 1 include:

Senate Bill 376 will require the Maryland Department of Health to regularly report to the legislature on the progress it has made to reduce a significant backlog of required annual nursing home inspections. Under the new law, the department will need to start providing quarterly reports to lawmakers on the progress of nursing home inspections, and the Office of Health Care Quality will have to report to local jurisdictions every six months on the progress of inspections in their individual counties.
Motorists using Interestate 83 in Baltimore will have to watch their speeds. House Bill 913, passed earlier this year, authorizes doubling the number of automated speed-monitoring devices on the city portion of the highway from two to four cameras.
For bills that ended up passing both chambers unanimously, lawmakers spent an inordinate amount of floor time — and offered an inordinate number of bad puns — for Senate Bill 544 and House Bill 559, the agritourism porta-potty bills. When the new law takes effect June 1, it will allow certain wineries, farm breweries and farms engaged in “agritourism” — like pick-your-own fields and corn mazes — to meet the requirement for on-site lavatory facilities by providing portable toilets with soap and water and located at least 25 feet from any wells.

And finally… chromite! And an orange crush
Two new state symbols — an official state mineral and a cocktail — join the list of about two dozen that includes official state sports, dogs, cats and dinosaurs, among others.
Chromite, a commercially valuable mineral first discovered in Baltimore County in the early 1800s, has become the official state mineral with the enactment of House Bill 411. The effort was a passion project for David Shore, who first testified on the bill nearly a decade ago. Now, at age 18, Shore’s effort not only passed the House and Senate but landed on the desk of the governor.
And the rising tide for chromite lifted another state symbol effort.
In the waning hours of the 2025 session, a bill making the orange crush — a vodka and juice drink invented in Ocean City — the official state cocktail was going nowhere. But as lawmakers were finishing their work, a late amendment in the House added Orange Crush to Senate Bill 764, the Senate’s version of the chromite bill. Senators concurred before the final gavel fell, and Maryland got an official state cocktail to go with its official mineral.

(Maryland Matters file photo)In his coverage of the downgrade of Maryland’s credit rating by Moody’s from the coveted AAA to AA1, Bryan Sears pointed to Moody’s acknowledgement of Maryland’s “wealthy and diverse economy,” solid financial planning and proactive management by officials, including slowing expenditures and raising new funds.
But the report also noted that Maryland was particularly vulnerable to “shifting Federal policies and employment” in comparison to other states with triple-A ratings: Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia.
In plain-speak, Maryland’s administration was well equipped to handle any organic financial issues arising from budgetary deficits, and/or ambitiously funded programs. But our reliance on federal jobs meant that no one could foresee or plan for such eventualities.

Among all the states with a triple-A rating, Maryland’s economy is the only one which is dominated by the government sector. Being a small state and adjacent to the nation’s capital, Maryland’s largest source of income is income tax. Almost one in 10 Maryland workers is a federal employee. The only variable NOT in control of the state administration is the employment of federal workers.
It isn’t hard to see the connection.
Republican delegates and senators who tout Moody’s warnings about Maryland’s rating prior to this current federal administration taking charge are forgetting that the programs with high price tags, like the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, were hit because of the COVID-19 economy.
We barely had time to come up to the surface to take a breath of air before being submerged again by this second Trump administration! The GOP needs to take a hard look at themselves, and their blind obeisance to the walking body of malfeasance they regard as their president.
Here is the bottom line: Moody’s downgraded Maryland’s credit rating because, despite the Moore administration’s best efforts, they could not fix the damage done by DOGE and their dismantling of federal government.
Maryland, D.C. and Virginia have the maximum number of federal employees – both Maryland and D.C. had their ratings downgraded. Virginia is a much larger state and has other economic avenues to offset the loss of federal jobs, even though it, too, has taken a substantial hit to its economy.
Blame, if it is to be assigned, lies with the Trump administration and its hatchet approach to federal infrastructure. Believe me, the damage goes far beyond a credit rating — the United States will be feeling the effects of this sabotage for decades to come.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — After a drawn-out day of disagreements and false starts, the Vermont Legislature bailed on its plan to wrap up business for the year on Friday, failing to come to a deal, at least for now, on this year’s landmark education reform bill.So strained were the talks, the House and Senate couldn’t even immediately agree on when negotiations would continue.The Senate gaveled out for the night shortly after 11 p.m. Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, told his colleagues that coming to an agreement needed more time, and the Senate would instead gavel back in at 2 p.m. Saturday.“We’re going home now,” Baruth said. Soon after, around 11:30 p.m., the House adjourned until Monday at noon. From there, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, said the chamber would be holding brief sessions without taking any actions, known as “token sessions,” until mid-June. That’s when legislators had previously penciled in to hold votes to override potential vetoes by Gov. Phil Scott.  “We’ve been putting compromises on the table all day, trying to find a path forward,” Krowinski said in an interview after ending her chamber’s business for the night. “This is a top priority for this legislative session, and we have to get it right. And at the end of the day, everyone was feeling like it needed more time.”Legislative leaders said they expect the joint House and Senate panel hashing out the education bill, H.454, to continue meeting in the coming weeks, though the schedule was not immediately clear.Both chambers signed off on a handful of other bills Friday, including sweeping housing legislation that would set out a program to finance infrastructure around new developments, a bill that would make it harder for neighbors to sue farmers over impacts the farm may have on their properties, and other bills on motor vehicles, cannabis and drug price caps.However, the outcome leaves the session’s highest-profile work unfinished. Following an election where property tax rates drove voters, leading to a wave of Republican victories in the House and Senate, Democratic legislative leadership pledged to heed voters’ call for a more affordable education system. Yet four months in, the path toward that future state remained murky.The parties began Friday closer than they ended it. Early in the day, the House and Senate conference committee members appeared to reach some tentative agreements on H.454. But as the hours wore on, negotiations — at least in public — faltered. The committee had been unable to lock in key details. Left unsettled was which funding formula to use, what to do about school choice and private schools and how to limit spending before school districts consolidate down the road. Meetings of the conference committee — three senators and three house members — were continuously postponed. Legislators and legislative staff scrambled in and out of rooms. Lobbyists lingered in the halls. As the conference committee drifted further and further from either chamber’s original position, the possibility of explaining the hugely complex and fast-changing piece of legislation to 180 lawmakers looked near-impossible. The vast majority of lawmakers dawdled as the conference committee worked in fits and starts, with people playing cards and sipping drinks throughout the Statehouse. The House, Senate and Scott have made education reform the year’s key issue. All three parties agreed on the need to consolidate school districts and transition the state to a new funding formula. But for months, the parties have reached little consensus on the intricacies and the timeline of that generational transformation. Baruth had told his chamber around 10 p.m. that agreement still looked possible.“It’s frustrating,” he said on the floor, describing the delay, “but the way I think about it is, your constituents and my constituents sent us here for this night because they want us to do our work, they want us to finish it up, pay strict attention and then be done and go home.”That proved overly optimistic.Read the story on VTDigger here:  With education bill at an impasse, Vermont Legislature kicks the can on adjournment.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/education-conference-4-20250530-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-31 01:01:26.306052

We reject the idea that there’s only so much to go around—especially when the numbers show otherwise.,"With just a few days left in this year’s legislative session, residents are waiting with bated breath to see whether the Connecticut legislature steps up and delivers a bold budget that invests in core programs, protects workers, tenants,  and immigrants, and meets the needs of our communities – or falls back on tired excuses and political theater.
Let’s be clear: Connecticut has the money.
It’s not because Governor Lamont can’t; it’s because he won’t.
We’ve heard it before: that supporting one group of workers must come at the expense of another; that if we fund fair contracts, we can’t fund public education; that if we invest in healthcare, we have to cut services somewhere else. But this is a false and dangerous narrative, and we will not allow it to divide us.
Nursing home and group home workers with SEIU 1199NE have exhibited bravery and determination in their contract fight and as a result have won state funding to support raises. But those purple shirts are still showing up at the State Capitol because this represents just one chapter of their fight.
People are multidimensional: they are workers, immigrants, parents, students, taxpayers, and more. We cannot silo issues just like we cannot silo people. Efforts to divide us only distract from the real issue: the Gov. Ned Lamont’s refusal to tax the wealthiest Connecticut residents or modify fiscal policies to reflect current realities.
We reject the idea that there’s only so much to go around—especially when the numbers show otherwise.
The state is sitting on a projected $2.3 billion surplus—the second largest in state history— and our Rainy Day Fund remains full. Meanwhile, our wealthiest residents and corporations continue to reap the economic benefits of our upside-down tax structure.
If Governor Lamont declares extraordinary circumstances, modifies the fiscal roadblocks and supports progressive taxation, our communities won’t just survive attacks from the federal government, but thrive in the face of adversity.
All year, thousands of advocates have testified, emailed, called and rallied, sharing the human stories that should be driving our budget process: Stories of students whose schools are facing millions in deficits; of looming layoffs to immigrant families left vulnerable by Governor Lamont’s veto threats on key protections in the TRUST Act; of workers facing stagnant wages and rising costs.
Faith, labor and community leaders have been clear about the robust investments that are needed across various issue areas. We cannot let proponents of the fiscal roadblocks use the victory of one group of workers as an excuse to cut other sectors. This narrative is not only divisive but also misleading. It pits one essential public service against another, ignoring the broader fiscal context and the state’s capacity to invest in all its communities.
This isn’t about choosing between students and nurses, or workers and services. It’s about whether we continue to govern by fear and austerity —or choose to invest in the future we all deserve.

The state Senate on Friday evening appeared likely to debate well into the night the details of what would be, if passed, the most significant piece of housing legislation to emerge from the Connecticut legislature in years.
House Bill 5002, which narrowly passed the House earlier this week after nearly 12 hours of debate, takes on zoning, parking policy and homelessness. It aims to increase housing supply, cut down on rent prices and encourage use of public transit, among other measures.
Over the past few years, housing costs have risen across the country. Homelessness has increased, and a recent study said Connecticut has the most constrained housing market in the nation.
“Housing is one of the biggest concerns when we knock on doors and talk with our constituents, every town hall, everything we hear is how housing is too scarce, it’s too expensive,” said Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London.
Housing has long been a politically difficult issue in Connecticut. It’s growing harder for many families to afford to live in the state, and advocates say the state needs to do more to push zoning reform and other policies to make housing cheaper.
But Republicans, some moderate Democrats and opponents of H.B. 5002 say they think control of these issues should remain with local government.
Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, who has been a vocal opponent of many of the ideas in the bill, questioned the existence of a housing crisis during debate Friday.
“If there is a housing shortage, it’s simply based on the fact that there’s not enough affordable listings for housing available out there in the marketplace,” he said, saying it’s “either not being advertised, or it’s not being made available by the people that possess it.”
He said there would be a housing crisis if there wasn’t enough housing for the population, and Connecticut hasn’t seen much population growth in recent years.
Experts and economists say housing shortages are more complicated than that. The market needs vacancies in order to keep costs down, and even when there is not population growth, there can be household growth as children get older and leave their parents’ homes.
Leaders on Friday said it seemed likely some Democrats would side with Republicans voting against the bill, and it could be a narrow margin for passage.
Planning and zoning
One policy in the bill, which drew political angst, is known as “Towns Take the Lead,” which is similar to fair share measures proposed in past sessions.
The proposal divides housing need among towns based on regional need and assigns each town a set number of units to plan and zone for, with those proposals required to be included in their 8-30j plans, which are due every five years. 
It uses a formula to determine how many units of affordable housing towns need to plan and zone for, with a general goal to increase housing stock and cut down on segregation. The bill contains some other specifications for the housing, including requirements to build units for families and for certain income levels.
Under the bill language, towns can contest their assigned numbers and tell the legislature how many units they think they can accommodate, and lawmakers will approve or deny the towns’ proposals.

The legislation also includes Gov. Ned Lamont’s proposal to offer towns easier pathways to moratoriums under 8-30g. The decades-old housing law offers developers court remedies if their affordable housing proposals are denied, unless it’s for a reason of health or safety.
Towns can get moratoriums under the law by showing they’re making progress toward increasing their percentage of designated affordable housing and are exempt from the law if at least 10% of their housing stock is designated affordable.
Lamont’s proposal allows municipalities to establish a “priority housing development zone” that set a minimum density of four units per acre for single-family housing, six for duplexes or townhouses and 10 for multi-family housing.
The zones allow this type of development “as of right,” or without a special hearing before the local planning and zoning commission. Towns that adopt these zones have easier pathways to moratoriums under 8-30g.
It’s a controversial proposal among housing advocates who oppose changes to 8-30g and say too many adjustments could render the law ineffective.
The bill also aims to get towns to increase residential density near train and bus stations by prioritizing certain infrastructure funding for towns that establish “transit-oriented districts,” where certain development is allowed as of right before the planning and zoning commission.
The bill, known as Work, Live, Ride, and pushed by advocacy group Desegregate Connecticut aims to increase the housing stock and encourage people to use public transportation, which advocates say is good for the environment.
Opponents say the prioritization of funding means that towns that don’t participate in the program could risk losing funding they need for roads and bridges.
Town requirements
The bill bans minimum off-street parking requirements for certain residential developments. This allows developers to cut down on building costs by not adding as many parking spaces. 
Advocates say removing parking minimums allows more housing to be built in areas that may already have sufficient street parking or are close to public transportation. Meanwhile, opponents say it weakens local control and runs the risk that developers will ignore parking needs.
The bill requires towns to allow developers to convert commercial buildings to residential with nine or fewer units without a special hearing before the planning and zoning commission.
Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester, said it will use office space and other commercial areas that have been empty since the COVID-19 pandemic. Opponents say it will usurp local control.
H.B. 5002 also includes a couple of measures to help the unhoused population. It bans towns from using so-called “hostile architecture” on public property. Hostile architecture is an urban design architecture in which certain public structures are designed to discourage behaviors such as sleeping or lying down in public. It often comes in the form of spiked surfaces under bridges, narrow benches or rocks strewn across grassy areas.
Homelessness has been increasing over the past few years in Connecticut, and as shelters reach capacity, more people are forced to stay outside.

The bill also expands the number of fair rent commissions in Connecticut, mandating that any town with a population of 15,000 or more establish a commission, which are local bodies empowered to hear and make legally binding rulings on landlord-tenant issues such as complaints about unfair rent increases or housing conditions.
This year’s bill requires an additional 32 towns to have fair rent commissions and allow towns to establish regionalized commissions through their local councils of government, according to 2023 population estimates.
Supporters say the commissions help make sure rent increases aren’t excessive. Opponents fear that small towns may struggle to find people to volunteer to be members of the commissions.
If passed, the bill next heads to Lamont’s desk for his approval.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_280-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 23:58:59.304280

CHICAGO — Federal prosecutors are asking for a lengthy 12 ½-year prison sentence for former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, calling the longtime Democratic power broker “steeped in corruption” and alleging he lied on the witness stand when he testified in his own defense earlier this year.

In their 72-page filing Friday evening, prosecutors also called for a $1.5 million fine in addition to prison time for the 10 corruption charges — including bribery — on which Madigan was convicted in February.

“The crimes charged and proven at trial demonstrate that Madigan engaged in corrupt activity at the highest level of state government for nearly a decade,” prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum. “Time after time, Madigan exploited his immense power for his own personal benefit by trading his public office for private gain for himself and his associates, all the while carefully and deliberately concealing his conduct from detection.”

But in a competing filing published to the court docket two hours later, Madigan’s attorneys argued the former speaker should only serve five years’ probation, including a year of home detention followed by community service.

Madigan is scheduled to be sentenced June 13.

Along with Madigan’s legal arguments for no prison time, his attorneys also filed hundreds of pages of character letters asking U.S. District Judge John Blakey for leniency in sentencing, upon which Madigan’s lawyers bolstered their request.

“Throughout his 83-year life, Mike quite literally changed the lives of tens of thousands of people in his district on the south side of Chicago,” Madigan’s filing stated. “He positively impacted millions of people throughout the State of Illinois. The more than 200 letters submitted on Mike’s behalf demonstrate that this is not hyperbole.”

Madigan, who stepped away from public life in early 2021 as the feds’ investigation swirled around his inner circle, spent five decades in the Illinois House, including 36 as House speaker — the longest tenure of any legislative leader in the country. He also spent 23 years as head of the state’s Democratic Party, granting him even more power over Illinois’ political landscape.

Split verdict

After three months of testimony from more than 60 witnesses and dozens of hours of secretly recorded audio and video, a jury convicted Madigan on 10 of 23 counts he was facing. But jurors acquitted the former speaker on seven counts and deadlocked on another six, including an overarching racketeering charge.

The former speaker’s convictions involved alleged bribery from electric utility Commonwealth Edison, which hired five of the speaker’s allies on no-work contracts at various times from 2011 and 2019 — an eight-year period during which ComEd was pushing for major legislation in the General Assembly. The jury also convicted Madigan on supporting counts related to an alleged scheme to help get Chicago alderman-turned-FBI mole Danny Solis appointed to a lucrative state board position, though he was acquitted of the bribery charge pertaining to the same alleged scheme.

Some of the trial’s most dramatic moments came in January, when Madigan made the stunning decision to testify in his own defense. The high-risk move opened him up to blistering cross-examination from lead prosecutor Amarjeet Bhachu, who left the U.S. Attorney’s office in March and isn’t a party to sentencing recommendations.

Over two days, Bhachu sparred with the former speaker, and weeks later he and his colleagues quoted Madigan’s testimony back to the jury during closing arguments in an attempt to prove he’d lied on the witness stand.

Prosecutors leaned on that alleged perjury once more in Friday’s sentencing memorandum, counting his “obstructive conduct” as a key justification for their sentencing recommendation.

“Madigan has expressed no remorse for his crimes, nor has he acknowledged the damage wrought by his conduct,” prosecutors wrote. “Indeed, Madigan went so far as to commit perjury at trial in an effort to avoid accountability, and he persists in framing his actions as nothing more than helping people.”

Madigan repeatedly claimed — and his attorneys repeatedly argued — that he was ignorant of the fact that the collective $1.3 million his allies earned from their ComEd contracts was for performing no work. Instead, the former speaker and his lawyers framed those contracts as the result of mere job recommendations, which they argued was a core component of Madigan’s job as speaker.

But as a result of Madigan’s testimony, U.S. District Judge John Blakey reversed a pre-trial decision and allowed prosecutors to play a damning wiretapped phone call for the jury in which Madigan laughed about ComEd contractors having “made out like bandits.” In the call, the former speaker’s co-defendant, longtime Springfield lobbyist Mike McClain, laughed, too, replying, “for very little work.”

Prosecutors cited that call in its Friday filing as evidence the former speaker wasn’t forthcoming when he ""testified that McClain never said he believed or suspected that any of the people that Madigan had referred to ComEd were not working.”

“This testimony was a lie,” the feds wrote in their filing.

Prosecutors also ripped Madigan’s attempts on the witness stand to distance himself from McClain, his longtime close friend and advisor, which the feds said “completely undermined” the former speaker’s “credibility as a witness.”

“The multitude of recorded conversations, emails, and documents presented at trial established a uniquely close and longstanding relationship of mutual dependence between Madigan and McClain and demonstrated that Madigan was lying when he tried to distance himself from his key operative,” prosecutors wrote.

“Madigan assigned McClain, and only McClain, to carry out the most sensitive assignments and requests and to engage in the most potentially politically explosive conversations when Madigan wanted bad news delivered, including to legislators who served under Madigan.”

The jury in February deadlocked on all six counts pertaining to McClain, but he faces his own sentencing in July on charges related to the ComEd bribery scheme after a jury in May 2023 convicted him and three other ex-utility executives and lobbyists for their roles.

Plea for leniency

Of the more than 200 letters filed Friday with Madigan’s legal arguments for a non-custodial sentence, many came from former constituents or other Illinoisans who wrote about how the former speaker helped them in some way.

Letters also came from prominent faith leaders across the state, 40 former staffers, prominent labor leaders and three dozen former elected officials, among them several Republicans like former Gov. Jim Edgar. Attorneys also included an op-ed in support of Madigan penned by former GOP Gov. Jim Thompson before his death in 2020.

All four of Madigan’s children wrote lengthy letters, including former Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, whom the former speaker adopted after marrying her mother Shirley in 1976. In addition to writing about how Madigan operated in the world of Illinois government and politics that her adoptive father introduced her to, Lisa Madigan’s letter highlighted what the former speaker’s attorneys called “a key consideration” for Madigan’s sentencing: his wife’s health.

“Mike keeps my mother alive,” Lisa Madigan wrote in her letter, which said Shirley Madigan suffers from “a severe lung disease” and has “rarely been well enough to leave the house” in the last five years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as she’s “extremely susceptible to infections” and has been hospitalized three times.

“She is able to remain in their house primarily because of the care my father provides,” Lisa Madigan wrote. “He shops for groceries, brings her food (as you heard during the trial), does laundry, and generally takes care of her and their house.”

Lisa Madigan was referring to a lighthearted moment on one of the wiretapped calls played for the jury in which the then-speaker read a menu of soup options to his wife over the phone.

Madigan’s attorneys wrote that even “one day of imprisonment” for Madigan “will upend her (Shirley’s) entire life.”

“Mike presence is medically necessary to provide the direct assistance, supervision, and emotional support required to maintain Shirley’s well-being in a familiar home environment, which is paramount for patients with Shirley’s conditions,” the filing said, going on to refer to Madigan as Shirley’s “caretaker.”

The former speaker’s lawyers also referred to Madigan’s own age as a mitigating factor for sentencing, though leaned more heavily on kneecapping prosecutors’ arguments that a 12 ½-year sentence would serve as a deterrent.

“The defendant respectfully submits that a sentence of imprisonment would be greater than necessary to protect the public or deter him from criminal conduct,” the filing read. “Mike does not pose a risk of committing new crimes. He will never hold public office again.”

Madigan’s attorneys went on to detail “intense public embarrassment for (the former speaker) and his family,” which they argued “is a significant punishment in and of itself.” They also claimed the former speaker’s grandchildren “are teased at school” because of Madigan’s criminal case.

“As one example, Mike was publicly compared to a mob boss,” Madigan’s filing read. “Politicians also continue to use Mike as a cheap political shot, without any regard for his history of good works and positive impact on Illinois. ... He will also live the rest of his years as a felon.”

Other notable letter-writers on Madigan’s behalf included former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, former Illinois Supreme Court Justice Tom Kilbride, Democratic mega- fundraisers Michael Sacks and Fred Eychaner and Chicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf. While many former Democratic allies of Madigan penned appeals to Judge Blakey, only a few currently hold office — among them state Reps. Marcus Evans, D-Chicago, and Curtis Tarver, D-Chicago, along with Auditor General Frank Mautino.

Several authors of Madigan’s character letters had testified in trial, including his former law partner Vincent “Bud” Getzendanner, whose time on the witness stand was spent trying to explain the ethical firewall the Madigan & Getzendanner real estate law firm had with official state business.

In his letter, Getzendanner joked that he was “pretty sure” Madigan was “only human” and also poked a hole in the longtime Springfield mythology Madigan’s daily lunchtime apple, which he said demonstrated the former speaker’s “famous willpower.”

“Strangely enough, on many occasions I subsequently found an unexplained residue of chocolate chip cookie crumbs on his plate,” Getzendanner wrote, later apologizing to the judge for his sense of humor.

The bill now heads to the House and, if passed into law, would create a groundbreaking new fund for early childhood education that draws from surplus funds, with up to $300 million invested each year. Also included in the bill are new supports related to special education for school districts, teachers and students.
Advocates cheered and legislators embraced on Friday night after the passage of Senate Bill 1, calling it a major step forward in a state where the too-small and underfunded early childhood education sector has made it difficult for working families, especially mothers, to pay for and even find quality infant, toddler and pre-K programming for their kids.
Advocates of the bill include Gov. Ned Lamont, who pledged in February to make a game-changing investment in early childhood, drawing on surplus funds. At the time, Lamont was focused on creating a universal pre-K fund. S.B. 1 represents a more wide-ranging effort to create not just free or low-cost pre-K but also slots for infant and toddler care, something that advocates and educators say is sorely needed.
Office of Early Childhood Commissioner Beth Bye said Friday that the governor was feeling great about the bill.
“The governor was very flexible with that (infant and toddler spots),” Bye said, “because he knows that’s a big challenge, too.” 
Under the plan, families making up to $100,000 a year would pay nothing for the child care services, which would be run through Early Start programs, while families making more than $100,000 a year would pay no more than 7% of their annual income, with no income limit. The bill would also improve salaries for workers in those centers so that they’re more in line with public school teacher salaries and includes a health care subsidy program for those workers.
As the Senate prepared to vote on the bill, President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, discussed a report from Dalio Education on “disconnected youth” as a motivator. Looney said, “so many of our children come to kindergarten unprepared to be there,” and then experience humiliation when they realize they are already behind their peers. He said that sets them on a path toward disconnection from school down the road, whereas the proposed bill would create a chance to come to school prepared for success.
Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, who is co-chair of the Committee on Children, celebrated the bill’s passage. 
“I’m so excited about this transformational bill, for parents, for providers, for advocates, for everyone who has had a hand in this, from the governor to OPM to the office of the treasurer, to the legislature,” she said. “It means we are making a permanent investment in the future of child care in our state, and it is the first state in the union to do this.”
Maher said what distinguishes Connecticut from states like Vermont and New Mexico, which have also made investments in early childhood education, is that Connecticut is taking a holistic approach to trying to make improvements throughout the system, from provider pay to creating more spaces. “It will change the nature of child care in Connecticut,” she said.
But critics of the bill argued that the state would be violating its fiscal guardrails in using surplus money to pay for it all. Sen. Eric Berthel, R-Watertown, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, attempted and failed to pass an amendment to the bill that would have used money from the general fund instead of surplus funds. Harding argued that in using surplus funds, legislators were being dishonest with their constituents.
“You’re telling your constituency, ‘Well, legally we can do this within the guardrails,’ but you know as we all know that it violates the spirit of why the guardrails are there,” he said.
Harding said that the surplus should only go toward one of two things: the rainy day fund or paying down the state’s debt. “If we can’t find $40 million as a priority in a multibillion dollars budget toward early childhood and early education initiatives, I think our priorities are lost,” he said.
But the bill’s transformational aspirations rely on using surplus funds, and socking them away into an endowment that would grow over time. As time goes on, 10% of those funds could be used each year, an ever-larger sum as the fund continues to build. 
While there may have been disagreement earlier in the session about the best path forward to address the early childhood education crisis, the smiles, handshakes and cheers from lawmakers and advocates who had once championed different bills showed unity. 
“This is the result of a long, constructive set of negotiations to try and get to something that really works,” said Merrill Gay, the executive director of the CT Early Childhood Alliance.
“It’s amazing, said Eva Bermúdez Zimmerman, the coalition director of Child Care for CT, “and next year we’ll be back to ask for more money.”
The bill also includes supports for special education, which Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Trumbull, said respond to feedback collected by the Select Committee on Special Education, which she co-chairs. 
The bill includes a $10 million grant to create better special education programming in some districts so that students don’t have to travel out of district. And it requires programs to send out notifications when staffing changes, like substitute teachers, last more than 10 school days — disruptions that can have a big impact on special education students. It also creates an educational ombudsman who would help mediate issues that arise when families are having trouble accessing services. The special education provisions in the bill complement those in House Bill 5001.
“Education has to be a priority for Connecticut, we are building our future,” Gadkar-Wilcox said. From early childhood to special education to higher education, “we need to think about how these pieces are interconnected.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_148-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 23:00:43.612625

“For one person to stand in the way of it is, really, unacceptable,” said Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas, a key proponent of the election legislation.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — A bill that would make a host of changes to the state’s election laws, including an expansion of who must file campaign finance disclosures, appeared to be facing dim prospects Friday — even though the House approved the legislation in March.The reason the bill, H.474, hadn’t yet advanced in the Senate, on what could be the final day of this year’s legislative session?“He’s right there,” Vermont Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas told VTDigger at the Statehouse Friday afternoon, pointing at Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, as he walked by in a hallway.According to the secretary, Baruth told Rutland Republican Sen. Brian Collamore, chair of the Senate Government Operations Committee, which has been reviewing the elections bill, not to advance it to the floor unless the House Government Operations Committee advanced another, unrelated bill — a Burlington charter change proposal on which Baruth is the primary sponsor.Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes, said the House panel he chairs didn’t have the votes to pass out the Burlington bill, S.131, which would ban guns from bars and other venues that serve alcohol in the city.  The Senate passed the measure last month, though Gov. Phil Scott has signaled he does not support it.“We were told that the (elections) bill would not move until the Burlington charter” advanced in the House, Birong said in an interview Friday on the House floor.Baruth also lives in Burlington and represents the city in the Senate.Asked about Copeland Hanzas and Birong’s comments Friday evening, Baruth said, “I wouldn’t repeat private conversations” and contended that he “wouldn’t link” the charter change with the elections bill.Secretary of State Sarah Copeland-Hanzas speaks about small donation campaign finance reform during a press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on June 18, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerBaruth said the elections bill wasn’t moving forward in the Senate because lawmakers ran out of time to take it up amid other competing proposals. Legislative leaders had been planning to adjourn for the year late Friday, though it wasn’t certain they would. “Burlington has waited 12 years for that charter — and it’s crazy that it’s being held up in the House,” the pro tem added. The city also attempted to get a ban on guns in bars approved by the Legislature in 2014, but wasn’t successful.Copeland Hanzas and Deputy Secretary of State Lauren Hibbert were both at the Statehouse Friday pushing to get the election bill over the finish line, Copeland Hanzas said. As it passed the House, the bill also includes a slate of measures she said would improve how municipal clerks can run local elections.Copeland Hanzas accused Baruth of playing “political gamesmanship.”“The important reforms that are in that elections bill are going to benefit every single municipal clerk across the state, and benefit our office and make it easier for us to ensure that we have fair, secure and error-free elections,” she said. “And so for one person to stand in the way of it is, really, unacceptable.”Copeland Hanzas added that it’s possible the bill would not advance in a similar form during next year’s session, in 2026, because legislators typically try to avoid making many changes to election laws in a year when they, themselves, would be on the ballot.Collamore, the Senate Government Operations Committee chair, said Friday that he believed his committee would have passed out the election bill with four of its five members in support. He declined to say whether Baruth, the pro tem, had influenced the bill’s fate.“I won’t comment on that,” he said in an interview Friday evening. Birong said some Democrats on his House committee were concerned the charter change would be confusing if guns were prohibited in bars in one city, but nowhere else in the state.Gov. Phil Scott had expressed similar concerns with the bill and told reporters last week at a press conference he would veto it if it reached his desk. Legislators would be unlikely to succeed on a vote to override any potential veto this year. Birong had strong words for the pro tem, as well.“I find it very discouraging that, especially in this day and age where we’re trying to do everything we can to maintain the sanctity of our elections, that a charter request from the pro tem’s district would jeopardize such an essential piece of legislation,” he said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Election bill falters at 11th hour after Senate president ties its fate to Burlington gun bill he backed.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/phil-baruth-1-20250523-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-30 22:01:18.992622

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Democrats introduced what a leading budgeteer described as a $55 billion budget Friday evening ahead of a Saturday deadline to pass the fiscal year 2026 spending plan.

The 3,363-page spending proposal was unveiled after 6 p.m. At the time the Senate’s lead budget negotiator, Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, briefed reporters on the plan; an exact proposal for raising about $1 billion in revenue to pay for it had not been made publicly available.

But Sims said lawmakers are not using broad tax hikes to balance the budget, although the plan does call for specific tax increases in certain areas. Sims said the proposal includes new taxes on gambling as well as tobacco and vape products. He also hinted that some businesses will pay more under the plan – though Illinois’ constitution mandates that the state corporate income tax remain a flat rate.

“We're trying to make sure that individuals pay their fair share, and corporations, who are the most prosperous are most profitable, also pay their fair share,” Sims said.

The plan is roughly in line with what Gov. JB Pritzker proposed in his February budget address as budget talks in Congress have injected uncertainty in state finances.

“This budget recognizes that there are significant challenges that we have, that we will face, and it makes sure that the chaos that is coming out of Washington, we're prepared for it,” Sims told reporters Friday night. “We're not running away from our responsibility. We're running towards it.”

A health care program that provides benefits to undocumented immigrants in Illinois between ages 42 and 64 also appears to be eliminated. Pritzker proposed eliminating the program to save the state $330 million.

“He did not include the HBIA (Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults) program in the budget,” Sims said. “But again, that's in recognition of the challenges that we're seeing coming out of Washington and the devastating effects that those proposals are having on our state and states across the country.”

Pritzker proposed a $55.2 billion spending plan in February, but revenue forecasts have declined since then. The latest estimate in early May from the governor’s office pegged FY26 revenue at $54.9 billion while the General Assembly’s independent Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability projected revenue would come in at $54.5 billion – $1 billion below Pritzker’s February revenue estimate.

Expected declines in federal funding and a diminishing economic outlook have caused the downward revisions.

But the yet-to-be-filed revenue plan would make up a little over $1 billion in revenue, according to Sims.

Another source of new revenue in the budget proposal is a delinquent tax payment incentive program. The program is designed to help the state recuperate overdue tax payments. The program was proposed by Pritzker and is estimated to generate about $198 million in revenue.

With Medicaid funding cuts possible from Congress, Sims said the budget makes “significant” increases for the state’s hospital systems, in particular safety-net hospitals. He said the plan also builds in wage increases for direct service providers.

The proposed budget also fully funds the annual increase to the K-12 evidenced-based funding model with $350 million.

Lawmakers will also see their salaries rise as part of the budget, going to a $98,304 base salary from roughly $92,000. That’s an annualized rate of increase that is set by law.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Two weeks ago, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced a hiring freeze for most state agencies, paused new state regulations, and restricted state workers’ travel.
The governor’s administrative order arrived amid growing concerns about state spending, and much of it is similar to orders issued during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency and the oil price shock of the mid-2010s.
But this order has a new wrinkle: a pause on new state regulations.
“In order for agencies to focus their attention on the State’s core mission of providing essential services to Alaskans and maximizing operational efficiency, there is, effective immediately, a freeze on the promulgation of new regulations by all agencies. This freeze does not apply to regulations currently out for public notice,” the governor’s new order states.
If laws enacted by the Legislature and governor are the building blocks of state government, regulations are the mortar that holds them together: Regulations, proposed by state agencies or boards and commissions, cover the details that laws don’t, prescribing how state agencies should implement those laws.
“Governor Dunleavy issued Administrative Order 358 to ensure we are spending wisely and living within our means. This temporary pause on new regulations gives agencies time to evaluate priorities and reduce unnecessary regulatory growth,” said Jessica Bowers, a spokesperson for Dunleavy.
Since Dunleavy’s order, the state’s public records system shows only one new regulations package has been posted for public comment. In the same period last year, the online public records system shows seven. There were three during the same stretch of 2023 and five during that stretch of 2022.
This year, one of the biggest items affected by the governor’s order is a packet of regulations that would fully implement last year’s Ballot Measure 1, which requires paid sick leave and a minimum wage increase for workers starting July 1.
The measure, which was approved by 58% of participating Alaska voters last year, also forbids “captive audience meetings,” in which employees must listen to an employer’s views on religion, politics or unions.
New regulations require a 30-day comment period where the public can suggest changes to the final draft, and those regulations typically don’t become effective until 30 days after the final version is signed by the lieutenant governor.
In March, Adam Weinert, a special assistant to state Department of Labor Commissioner Cathy Muñoz, said that “the regulation packet is currently with the Alaska Department of Law, and we intend to have the packet out for a 30-day public comment in the near future.”
More than two months later, the packet still has not been published for public comment. The Department of Labor has not answered multiple requests for further information.
The delay has alarmed some of the measure’s supporters, who think it could be part of a national pattern.
In Nebraska and Missouri, voters also passed paid sick leave ballot measures last year. In both places, state legislators proceeded to overturn those ballot measures this spring.
Here in Alaska, five Republican members of the state House introduced a bill that would roll back Alaska’s voter-approved law.
“As those issues have won at the ballot box, really since 2016, we have seen an escalation of attacks to direct democracy and voter-approved initiatives,” said Chris Melody Fields, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a national progressive organization.
“We’ve seen that especially on the economic justice ballot measures that were passed in 2024,” she said.
The Alaska bill lacks the support needed to pass the House or Senate and may be unconstitutional, which leaves regulatory hurdles as the last obstacle before it becomes effective.
Bowers, in the governor’s office, cited the text of the governor’s administrative order and said that agencies “can submit a waiver to move forward with paused regulations if the regulations are necessary to protect the safety of the public or to meet other essential State responsibilities.”
By email, she confirmed that the Department of Labor has submitted a waiver request and that it is under review. 
The Alaska Department of Law, which has been examining the regulations package for more than two months, did not answer a question on Friday seeking information about the status of that review.
Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska chapter of the AFL-CIO, a federation of 63 national and international labor unions, said that regardless of what happens with the regulations, Ballot Measure 1 will become law on July 1.
She supported the measure and has been tracking its implementation with interest. 
“Those regs need to have a 30-day comment period … they should have been out 90 days ago, so they could have taken in public comment,” she said.
Without regulations, Alaskans will still be entitled to sick leave and a higher minimum wage, but employers might not know how to keep track of that sick leave and report it properly, she said.
She noted that the Department of Labor has an FAQ about the measure.
Other organizations, including the Foraker Group and the law firm Landye Bennett Blumstein have also published detailed explanations on the new law going into effect.
Attorney Scott Kendall said that a regulations package could still go forward after the law becomes effective. 
But Hall said that still leaves employers guessing.
“You’re going to have a lot of employers who are confused about how they’re going to track things,” she said.
Of the state’s decision to wait on releasing regulations, she said, “I’m not sure what they think they’re doing aside from confusing people.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/250422-Capitol-flags-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 22:01:18.992622

It’s the latest wave of immigrants from Southeast Asia to come to the state. This is part one of a  five part audio series, Mabuhay sa Alaska, by KMXT and breaks down how and why those teachers are here, as well as what it means for both Alaska, and the island nation.
Serjoe Gutierrez stood above the Kodiak High School Orchestra, violin in hand, as students rifled through their sheet music for pieces like “The Barber of Seville” and “Canyon Sunset.” Gutierrez often plays with his students instead of conducting them.
Gutierrez, who was born and raised in the Philippines, was in his fifth year of teaching there when he decided he wanted to try to work in another country.
“I think it’s time for me to come out of my comfort zone, explore a lot of opportunities, since I’m still young,” he said.
Alaska wasn’t high on his list. Kodiak barely made it on his radar.
“Kodiak was the last school district I applied to because it was the last school district that pop(ped) out of my Google browser,” Gutierrez said. “And I told myself, ‘Well if not in Kodiak, maybe the United States is not for me.’”
He’s now in his third year of teaching here.

Gutierrez’s immigration story is one of hundreds already playing out in schools all over Alaska, from the Aleutians to the North Slope to Southeast, as dozens of school districts have hired from the Philippines amid a national shortage of certified teachers.
School districts are cutting out the middleman
Gutierrez has become well known in Kodiak. Parents chat with him at student concerts, and he hosts a Filipino music show on KMXT. He plays piano at a local church, as well as violin for charity auctions and in the community’s theater.
He has even joined the Kodiak Island Borough School district’s efforts to recruit more teachers from his home country. In January, Gutierrez helped lead a group of Alaska school administrators on a recruiting trip to the Philippines.

Until recently, school districts have relied on third-party agencies to recruit teachers. But with demand up and opportunities to cut out middlemen, Kodiak’s district has led the way to recruit directly from the Philippines.
Some parents and Kodiak community members have criticized the practice for being too expensive. Kodiak Island Borough School District spent about $28,000 to send a team of 4 people this year, including Gutierrez. Teams like that screen hundreds of candidates in a single trip.
Working with lawyers and visa fees cost an additional $7,000 per teacher hired. Districts also can pay another $2,400 if they want to work with immigration lawyers to extend visas.
Hiring through an agency can cost a district about $27,000 per teacher.
And districts aren’t the only ones that pay when going through agencies. When Gutierrez started looking for work abroad three years ago, he had to pay $50 just to learn how to apply for jobs in other countries. Many teachers in the Philippines make only about $400 per month. He’s heard of some agencies charging teachers thousands of dollars once they’ve been placed in the U.S.
“The best of the best”
It took the group of administrators about two days to travel from Anchorage to the Philippines for the most recent recruitment trip. On the first day of recruiting, in a hotel conference space near Manila, candidates wore Western dresses and suits – even tuxedos. Others wore traditional Filipino formal wear, like embroidered shirts called barong tagalogs and distinctly shouldered filipinianas.

The room was full of candidates with graduate and postgraduate degrees. Some of the administrators said that on recruiting trips within the U.S., candidates were often fresh from their undergraduate colleges.
The Bering Strait School District has hired up to 60 teachers in a single year – about a third of its total teaching staff. The district has hired international teachers through an agency before, but this was its first time sending someone to recruit directly.
Tera Cunningham leads the district’s human resources. She’d never seen so many people vying for teaching jobs in Alaska.
“It’s exciting to see so many well-trained, well-prepared people who genuinely just want to help kids,” she said.
  Recruiters like Tera Cunningham work in teams of two to screen eight people at a time. (Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)
 
The candidates had only a few minutes to introduce themselves and impress the administrators. Out of the first group of 120 candidates, less than a third had callbacks that day.
“It is intense to do it this way, and we know we’ll get the best of the best here,” Cunningham said.
She said meeting candidates in person helps her visualize them in action.
“And so I’m excited to see who that looks like, what that looks like when they make it through and they’re finally at our sites,” she said.
But not every school district can afford to visit the Philippines. That’s part of why Jennifer Schmidt with the Alaska Council of School Administrators joined the group. She said that the trip makes sense for districts with many openings, but some have only one or two.
The council, which handles the Alaska teacher and personnel system, received grant money from the U.S. Department of Education to improve the state’s retention and recruitment.
Kodiak’s school district has led the recruiting trips so far, but Schmidt said the eventual goal is for her to take the lead. She said ideally, schools wouldn’t need to recruit from abroad, but there just aren’t enough American and Alaska-grown candidates.
“It’s going to take a lot of turnaround and a lot of change in the state of Alaska for us to have enough teachers in Alaska and in the U.S. that are going to want to come and teach there,” she said.

SPRINGFIELD — Criminal justice reform advocates say legislation to seal criminal records for certain nonviolent crimes, which passed Friday in the House, would unlock economic opportunity for thousands of Illinoisans.

The so-called Clean Slate Act has failed twice before, but activists see renewed fiscal messaging as the key to reinvigorating the campaign. This time, the bill’s sponsor points to a “diverse coalition of stakeholders” and backing from business groups as signs Illinois could become the 13th state to enact similar legislation.

“This is something I've worked on for six long years, and now we have law enforcement and the business community — folks like the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, the Illinois Manufacturers Association — all on board,” Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, D-Peoria, said in an interview. “Not as a neutral party, but they are proponents. They want to see this bill passed.”

Like earlier proposals, Senate Bill 1784 would require law enforcement agencies to automatically seal records for nonviolent criminal convictions twice a year — Jan. 1 and July 1. The records would no longer be public, although law enforcement and state’s attorneys would retain access.

Gordon-Booth has sponsored Clean Slate legislation twice before — once in 2021 and again in 2023 — but neither bill progressed past committee.

Just a few days before the 2025 legislative session concludes, she filed it again. Within two days, it passed the House mostly along partisan lines, and is headed for debate on the Senate floor.

The session ends at midnight Saturday, although the bill could still pass after that deadline.

People convicted of certain violent offenses — including sex crimes against minors, DUI, reckless driving and violent offenses that require sex offender registration — would be ineligible to have their records sealed.

“I want to make this very, very clear: Serious criminal records are not eligible for automated sealing,” Gordon-Booth said during floor debate.

Gordon-Booth argued that conviction records trap formerly incarcerated individuals in a state of perpetual punishment, eclipsing access to employment, housing and educational opportunities. She said Clean Slate would remove these barriers, helping system-impacted people reintegrate into society instead of recidivating.

Paul Rothschild, managing director of operations for the Illinois Coalition to End Permanent Punishment — a group that advocates for the rights of people with criminal records — said he agrees. He said the justice system fails to follow through on its own promise: Once someone has served their time, they are entitled to a second chance.

“We believe that people should be accountable for the crimes that they commit. But we also believe there is an implied covenant that when they finish, they're supposed to be returned to the world made whole, and that covenant is not being kept by society. They're being forever subjugated in that lower caste, that lower class,” Rothschild said.

More than 3 million Illinoisans have arrest or conviction records, and an estimated 921,000 people are eligible for “sealing relief” — but only about 10% actually petition to have their records cleared, according to statistics from Live Free Illinois, a grassroots organization aimed at reforming the state criminal justice system and part of the Clean Slate Illinois steering committee, which coordinates the campaign’s messaging and advocacy efforts.

The bill would automate the process for individuals with nonviolent convictions to have their records sealed, once they have served their sentences, completed probation, and remained crime-free.

Many eligible individuals are deterred by steep fines, complex paperwork and long waiting periods, Gordon-Booth said. The “burdensome” process has contributed to massive court backlogs, according to Clean Slate Illinois.

“It’s going to automate the process, so this way we don't have to go through that whole trying to get the paperwork, trying to go through all the rigmarole,” said Chauncy Stockdale, who was formerly incarcerated and is now a member of the Live Free Illinois Fellowship, a reentry program that supports returning citizens.

The measure passed the House 81-28, with five Republicans joining Democrats in support of the measure. No Democrats voted against the bill.




During debate on the House floor, Minority Floor Leader Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, voiced concerns about the tentative $18 million price tag, and whether the state is capable of fully funding the policy in the years ahead, leaving counties to cover the cost.

“If this isn’t funded, we’re either going to be sending a large unfunded mandate to our counties, or we’re making a promise to 2.1 million people that will not be fulfilled without any funding,” he said.

Gordon-Booth detailed a three year “implementation ramp,” which would give the state time to identify funding sources for the local circuit clerks. She also said the Illinois State Police would absorb the initial costs and emphasized the state’s commitment to supporting circuit clerks in the rollout phase.

“It is our full intention to provide clerks with all that they need to implement this,” she said. “We are not going to send an unfunded mandate to our local governments.”

‘Workforce and economic policy’

On April 10, nearly 300 members, supporters and advocates from Live Free Illinois chapters gathered in front of the Abraham Lincoln monument in Springfield for Advocacy Day, calling on lawmakers to introduce the Clean Slate Act.

Live Free Illinois — a faith-based nonprofit focused on ending gun violence and mass incarceration — organizes Black congregations to push for systemic change. The organization is involved in the broad-based Clean Slate steering committee, which also includes the Fully Free Campaign, the Illinois Coalition to End Permanent Punishments, and Impact for Equity.

The day before, Muslim leaders also advocated for Clean Slate legislation at Illinois Muslim Action Day.

Beyond criminal justice reform, advocates pushed a new messaging angle this year to usher the legislation across the finish line: Clean Slate could boost Illinois’ economy.

As of April, Illinois has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, at 4.8% — above the national average of 4.2%, according to the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Jerika Richardson, senior vice president for equitable justice and strategic initiatives at the National Urban League, said the act would open doors for thousands of people who have been barred from work because of background checks.

“There are so many employers and businesses across this country who are struggling to find the workers that they need, and part of the reason is because these records are barriers,” Richardson said. “If Illinois passes the Clean Slate Act, you won't have to worry about businesses going to another state or leaving the country.”

An amendment to the Illinois Human Rights Act, signed by Gov. JB Pritzker in 2021, expanded legal protections for state workers by prohibiting discrimination based on criminal convictions, in addition to arrest records. Yet many say they continue to face employment hurdles despite the law.

People with conviction histories earn an average of 25% less than those with clean records — a gap the National Urban League says costs the state billions of dollars in lost wages. According to a news release from the National Urban League, the Clean Slate Act could generate more than $4.7 billion in lost wages for Illinois, easing economic disparities and addressing labor shortages.

Gordon-Booth echoed Richardson’s point, adding that her office frequently hears from constituents who are missing out on life-changing chances.

“I get calls from people saying, ‘I had an opportunity to get my dream job, and it fell through because of something that I did when I was 18 or 19.’ And we're talking about folks that are in their 30s,” Gordon-Booth said. “They have not gone through the process of hiring a lawyer, going through the court-mandated process, and folks are losing out.”

(Photos courtesy of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana)LINCOLN — Lawmakers approved the governor’s two appointees to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission on Friday over opposition from long-term advocates that the new members could delay or derail the rollout of the voter-approved medicine.
In separate votes, the Legislature approved the six-year commission appointments of Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln, an anesthesiologist, and Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, prevention director for Heartland Family Service. 
Oldenburg’s confirmation vote was 34-11. Mueting’s was 27-16. 
Committee advances Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission appointees

The two appointees needed at least 25 votes to be confirmed. Had one or both been rejected, Gov. Jim Pillen could still appoint someone else in the interim, without a legislative vote until 2026, or the same person if he chose.
Much of Friday’s debate on the confirmations, about 30 minutes for each nominee, revolved around whether the personal views of each woman could be separated from their new professional roles. For multiple years, Mueting and Oldenburg have opposed medical cannabis legislation at the State Capitol, including Mueting earlier this year.
Those legislative efforts were often supported by Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana and other long-time advocates who, in November, succeeded after a decade of pushing to legalize and regulate the medicine, often facing pushback from top state officials.
Appointee support and positions
The 71% voter approval for legalization and 67% for regulations also created the new state regulatory commission that Mueting and Oldenburg will now join. They will serve with the three commissioners on the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, per the ballot measure.
Those commissioners are Bruce Bailey of Lincoln and Kim Lowe of Kearney, with one vacancy still to be filled by Pillen to represent Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.

State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, the chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee that advanced Oldenburg 5-2 and Mueting 5-3, called the two candidates highly qualified.
He said Oldenburg’s extensive experience, combined with deep concern for the health, safety and overall well-being of Nebraskans through her 18 years of medical service, would shine. Holdcroft added that Mueting had a strong record of promoting public health issues while thoughtfully balancing public health goals with public safety considerations.
Multiple senators, including State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, said the two would make a great team and keep Nebraska focused on medicine, not recreational marijuana.
“I honestly don’t know of two better people to be on this board,” Storm said Friday.
Mueting had said last week that her goal as a prevention specialist for 24 years has been to prevent people from having substance use problems and that she’s looked at medical cannabis from a “360-degree view.”
“Helping to guide the rulemaking process around the needs of the people it’s intended to serve is my goal,” Mueting said. “There’s nothing about that goal that says we need to sacrifice public health and safety to attain it.”

Oldenburg said last week that she is “not a prohibitionist” of cannabis but is “pro-research.” She said cannabis has “a place in pain management” for certain ailments that cause suffering.
“Nebraska needs to seize the opportunity to be slow and deliberate in the manner in which we determine how best to designate appropriate conditions for medical cannabis and regulate those entities that will dispense medical cannabis in our state,” Oldenburg said. “I look forward to working with various parties to ensure that we in the State of Nebraska get this right.”
‘It’s about trust’
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who like Storm is a Republican, opposed Mueting but supported Oldenburg. Hansen brought Legislative Bill 677 earlier this year to set clearer medical cannabis regulations and guardrails with the backing of volunteers from the 2024 campaign.
LB 677 fell 10 votes short of advancing on May 20, the opposition of which Storm led. Mueting testified against the bill in March.
Hansen said he was concerned about Mueting’s impartiality and that lawmakers shouldn’t appoint someone who believes in prohibition to the Liquor Control Commission or someone who works for PETA to the Nebraska Brand Committee.

He said the same goes for someone to the Medical Cannabis Commission who “denies the legitimacy of medical cannabis to the very body tasked with implementing this regulation.”
“This isn’t just about professional qualifications,” Hansen said. “It’s about trust. Trust in the will of the voters. Trust in the integrity of this new commission and trust that we are putting the right people in place to carry out a law passed and overwhelmingly supported.”
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, vice chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee, said that while both Mueting and Oldenburg might be nice people, he was worried about “artificial hurdles.” He supported LB 677 partly because it would have set a path toward “access.”
The Medical Cannabis Commission is charged “exclusively” with the power to regulate the control of the possession, manufacture, distribution, delivery and dispensing of cannabis for medical purposes in the state. Rules and regulations for medical cannabis dispensaries are due July 1 under the voter-approved laws. Licensing is supposed to begin by Oct. 1.
LB 677 supporters and other advocates had voiced concerns that the Medical Cannabis Commission could craft regulations that prevent meaningful “access.”
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers has already vowed to sue the commission if it issues any medical cannabis licenses. He argues it is against federal law.
‘Slow-roll access for patients’
Hansen said the public is paying attention, noting that the remaining dozens of gubernatorial appointments that lawmakers considered over the past five months, lawmakers had received 21 online comments.

But for Mueting and Oldenburg combined, lawmakers had 208 online comments, Hansen said.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, said the Legislature again threw a “wrench” in the will of Nebraska voters. She criticized senators who used the ballot measures as a reason to oppose Hansen’s LB 677 but then voted to confirm appointees who “will slow-roll access for patients in this state.”
Eggers said the mission continues to be on patients, as it has been “from day one,” despite what some legislative opponents say.
“The representatives in the state that have misrepresented our mission will see their day where the people hold them accountable. Mark our words,” Eggers said in a statement. “The patients of this state may be weary, may be tired, but they stand strong and will hold lawmakers accountable for their votes. They have the blood of Nebraskans on their hands.”

Speaking at U.S. Steel’s Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, a week after he announced the partnership with Japan’s Nippon Steel, Trump criticized the Biden administration for relaxing steel industry protections in 2021.
“The exemptions that they gave allowed foreign competitors that come in and steal our industry, steal our jobs and bring them back home and bring them home by the boatload,” Trump said standing in front of steel mill workers in orange, reflective coveralls and hard hats. Some held signs reading “Make U.S.S. Great Again.”
Trump said the 25% tariff on foreign steel he reinstated at the start of his second term would increase to 50% to “even further secure the steel industry in the United States.”
“Nobody is going to get around that,” he said.

Nippon began courting U.S. Steel in December 2023 with a $14.9 billion offer, which was approved by shareholders. Political opposition to the sale centered on the national security implications of selling one of America’s largest steel companies to a foreign corporation. The deal was stranded for most of last year as President Joe Biden awaited a recommendation from the Council on Foreign Investment in the United States.
Like Biden, Trump also initially opposed the sale, but announced May 23 in a post on Truth Social that the deal was back on. He described it as a “planned partnership” between the Japanese and American companies that would bring $14 billion of investment in a matter of months. 
The domestic steel and aluminum industries have long been a focus of Trump’s trade policy. He reintroduced the 25% tariff on imports of the metals even before he announced his broad duties on products made overseas that he said would bring manufacturing back to American shores. 
“When I came into office eight years ago, I proclaimed a simple but truly important principle, if you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country,” Trump said. “A strong steel industry is not just a matter of dignity or prosperity and pride, it’s above all, a matter of national security.”
In his hour-long speech, Trump also touched on his administration’s immigration policy and recognized Pennsylvania elected officials in the audience, including Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District), a likely GOP candidate for governor next year.
“If you run, you’ve got my support,” Trump said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Trump’s remarks, however, focused on the long-delayed merger but provided few additional details for anxious investors. Nippon and U.S. Steel have not officially disclosed terms of the rumored transaction. Earlier this week, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) said the merger would be subject to a “national security agreement” under which the U.S. government would appoint some of the company’s directors.
Trump, instead, highlighted how he said it would benefit the Monongahela River Valley, where three of U.S. Steel’s plants employ nearly 4,000 workers. 
Nippon would invest $2.2 billion to increase production in the Mon Valley Works and $200 million in the company’s Advanced Technology Research and Development Center in nearby Munhall.
The post-merger U.S. Steel would also maintain all of its currently operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of 10 years. “We have that as a commitment,” Trump said.
And Trump promised there would be no outsourcing work or layoffs and that every U.S. Steel worker would receive a $5,000 bonus. 
“You’ve gone through a lot, it’s closing. It’s not closing,” Trump said to the crowd.
He brought several union leaders to the microphone, including Jason Zugai, vice president of USW Local 2227, and a third-generation steelworker. Zugal thanked elected officials including McCormick, Mueser and state Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Dauphin) for their concern as the sale took shape. 
“These investments are life changing for all the men and women here today and for our communities,” Zugai said. 
USW International President David McCall said in a statement Friday evening that the union remains concerned about the effects the merger will have on national security, its members and the communities where they work.
“We have not participated in the discussions involving U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel, and the Trump administration, nor were we consulted, so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the ‘planned partnership’ between USS and Nippon or the ‘golden share’ that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government,” McCall said.
McCall said the union’s only concerns are the long-term viability and sustainability of the current U.S. Steel facilities to safeguard the employment and retirement security of its members. So far, he said, the union has seen only public relations and not commitments in writing.
“Issuing press releases and making political speeches is easy. Binding commitments are hard,” McCall said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative effort backed by Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers to ban most consumable hemp and other THC products in the state stalled Friday and will now wait until at least 2026.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, sponsor of Legislative Bill 316, asked that her Legislative Bill 316 be “passed over” on Friday. She waited to do so until just 10 minutes before a two-hour debate would have ended, a time when Kauth would have needed 33 votes to survive a filibuster. After that, she would have needed 25 votes to pass LB 316 and send it to Gov. Jim Pillen.
Kauth had the backing of most of the officially nonpartisan Legislature’s 33 Republicans. But Republican State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair held to his promise to oppose LB 316 if it wasn’t amended to explicitly protect medical cannabis products.
Medical cannabis
Kauth tried to address Hansen’s concerns and would have, said Hansen. But lawmakers ran out of time, because State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha and other opponents successfully blocked LB 316 from being amended.

Hilgers has argued that THC products with delta-8 are already illegal, to which Cavanaugh said Friday that if that’s true, a bill isn’t needed.
Hansen said the current “environment” with Hilgers, who has opposed medical cannabis and has launched a statewide campaign against delta-8, could be “hostile.” Hansen said there was language in LB 316 that could “greatly impact” medical cannabis.
“That’s something I cannot have,” Hansen said. “I think the people passed [medical cannabis] for a specific reason, and I think they are then due to have what they voted for.”
Hilgers helped lead opposition to Hansen’s proposal for clearer medical cannabis regulations and guardrails with 53 sheriffs. His LB 677 fell short 10 votes of advancing on May 20.
Part of Friday’s last-ditch effort featured pressure on State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, who said she was concerned about “bad actors” in the THC arena but didn’t want to take away the health products some Nebraskans rely on.

Raybould echoed Hansen that lawmakers should allow a new medical cannabis regulatory commission to proceed with directives for those products.
Kauth said multiple times during the debate that her bill had nothing to do with medical cannabis and that more than a dozen amendments from Cavanaugh made it “impossible” to seek the changes needed to keep her bill moving forward.
“No one is going into anyone’s homes and searching their medicine cabinets,” Kauth said. “That is more hyperbole and hysteria from the left.”
Health and safety
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who prioritized Kauth’s LB 316 for this year’s session, encouraged Nebraskans not to buy the “garbage” products. He repeated that he would never jeopardize “the health or safety of our citizens of this state, especially children and young adults, for revenue.”
LB 316 would prohibit raw hemp above 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) of any concentration and with processed hemp prohibit the lesser of 0.3% THC on a total weight basis or 10 milligrams per package, effective Jan. 1. The mature stalks of Cannabis sativa and its fiber, oil, cake and any other naturally derived products would not be considered hemp, leaving a narrow legal path for some hemp-based products such as fibers and textiles.
  State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, center. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
If the bill passed, it would have included a “consumer safe harbor period” through the end of 2025 to give consumers time to discard any “illegal hemp” as newly defined under LB 316. Legal products would have faced an additional 10% wholesale tax at the time of purchase.
The new excise tax revenue raised would have been directed toward property tax relief.
Besides protecting the voter-approved medical cannabis laws, Kauth also worked with State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth to offer an “affirmative defense” in court if someone could prove they previously legally purchased what would have become “illegal hemp” under LB 316. That could include a receipt.
‘Good’ and ‘bad’ actors
State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, a Republican who represents a Pleasanton-based hemp company that has offered tours to state senators of its facilities, said there are good actors that lawmakers should be working with.
State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings, a close ally of McKeon, said there are no “good actors.”
Nebraska lawmakers again advance ban of most THC, consumable hemp products

Kauth read a letter from Hilgers that had said if LB 316 passed, his office would have announced a pause on new civil enforcement actions against “businesses operating in good faith” for at least 120 days, exactly through the end of 2025. Kauth declined to provide a copy of the letter because LB 316 did not pass.
Kauth and Storm said they now hope Hilgers ramps up his legal efforts against THC stores. 
Many hemp-focused businesses said the broad language in LB 316 would shut down their industry, even as supporters said the bill wouldn’t touch them. Kauth said Friday that some businesses that were fighting the changes are essentially “admitting that they are selling dangerous, untested, unregulated, synthetic pot products.”
“They are pushing the health and well-being of their pocketbook above the health and well-being of Nebraskans,” Kauth said. “I’m extraordinarily disappointed that that is where we have come.”
‘We’re not people’s parents’
Cavanaugh, who again led opposition to the bill, said regulations and not a ban were still the best path forward. He said LB 316 would go in the “opposite direction” of economic development for budding businesses who are “good actors.”
His LB 16, to implement regulations on THC products, did not advance from the Judiciary Committee this year, and lawmakers repeatedly rebuffed his efforts.

Cavanaugh repeated Friday that he is “ready, willing and able to work on a regulatory scheme that will actually do this the right way and answer all the concerns that people have.”
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who also pushed for regulations, said Kauth’s bill could cause more harm than good and that the state should let people be adults.
“Why do we have to act as if we’re the moral compass for the state? We’re senators. We’re not people’s parents,” said McKinney.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha said she had purchased CBD with hemp in it for her nearly 101-year-old mother, but she didn’t have a receipt for the product.
Cavanaugh said the proposed defense provision only dealt with individuals, so businesses would have needed to destroy or sell all products by September, when the bill, if passed, would have taken effect. If not, business owners would risk “countless felonies,” Cavanaugh argued.
What would be banned?
The debate on LB 316 has seen senators forcefully disagree with what would be banned, with supporters arguing it would only ban “synthetic” chemically modified hemp or THC, while opponents said the bill would stretch to CBD, creams, ointments and most other products.
Part of that is because LB 316 would count the THC level based on all concentrations — delta-8, delta-9, delta-10, etc. — and not just 0.3% delta-9 THCc. Cavanaugh and State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha have said that it could criminalize possessing a gummy as a felony.

Supporters of LB 316, however, say that only chemically modified “synthetic” products would be banned.
Nebraska lawmakers in 2011 already banned “synthetic” marijuana, such as K-2 or spice. Most hemp or other hemp-derived products require chemical modifications, such as heat.
‘We could have stopped it’
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman said that while, as a conservative, she doesn’t think government should be in the way of business or entrepreneurship, government does have a role to protect people “from things that they couldn’t otherwise do for themselves independently.”
“Individuals do not have the capacity to know the processes that go into developing a product. That’s what we have things like the FDA for,” Storer said, referring to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Cavanaugh, McKinney, Raybould and State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln repeatedly said that was part of the reason why regulations, not a ban, would be better, treating the products similarly to alcohol, tobacco or other drugs.
Kauth said that with lawmakers’ failure to move forward, senators must own that the next time someone dies because of the products, they will know: “We could have stopped it.”
LB 316 will return next year one vote away from passing, with eight minutes to go in the third round of debate, though it’s unclear what amendments might come. Rescheduling would be up to Speaker John Arch of La Vista.

[…]","Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin leads a meeting of the DNC Executive Committee in Little Rock on May 30, 2025. (Screen grab from livestream)Ahead of a meeting of the Democratic National Committee’s Executive Committee in Little Rock on Friday, DNC chair Ken Martin said the national party is committing the largest financial assistance to state Democratic parties ever.
“The DNC will push out over a million dollars every month to the state parties,” Martin said in an interview. That includes $22,500 a month to the Arkansas Democratic Party to help it mobilize its efforts to improve the party’s position in the Natural State, he said.
“Arkansas is one of the only states where we saw legislative gains (in 2024),” he said. Democrats gained a single seat in the 100-member Arkansas House in the state’s only majority-Latino district last year.
 “There’s real opportunity for us, but that means we have to take advantage of it. Arkansas is really an important part of the calculus of how we build our future,” Martin said.
Little Rock was a hub of Democratic Party activity this week. The Association of State Democratic Committees met Wednesday and Thursday, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The DNC Executive Committee met Friday at the Doubletree Hotel on Markham. 



 
At Friday’s meeting, Martin talked about steps he’s taking to make the party more transparent and democratic in the wake of Kamala Harris’ loss to Donald Trump and the election of a narrow Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. He also presented lists of his nominees for various party committees that will be voted on when the DNC meets in August.
Martin’s remarks in the meeting echoed his comments in an interview with the Arkansas Advocate Friday morning.
He acknowledged that Democrats are not popular with many voters and that the party faces a crisis.
“People don’t have faith and trust in the party,” he said.
Asked what will change people’s minds, Martin cited Missouri, where measures on paid family leave, minimum wage and abortion protections were on last year’s ballot.
“All of them passed overwhelmingly… Those same voters went down the ticket and voted for Trump and independents. So clearly, the policies that we support as Democrats are wildly popular throughout the country. What isn’t popular is the Democratic Party … so for us, when we talk to voters and make an appeal to them, we need to talk to them about the issues that they already know will make a material difference in the lives of their families and communities,” he said.
He also said party leaders need to change their Washington, D.C.-oriented mindset. 
“We have to actually understand that some of these areas that we’ve lost over time are because we didn’t make the investment of time, energy and money. We stopped organizing. We stopped working in places like Arkansas in a meaningful way. As a result they become red,” Martin said.
“We didn’t come here just because Little Rock is beautiful. We came to send a message,” he said. “I’ve watched Arkansas change over the years, and I know we can change it again.”
He said he’s focused on rebuilding the party infrastructure, especially in Republican-controlled states like Arkansas. He noted that political power in the U.S. is shifting to the South, where six of the 10 fastest-growing states are.
“If we don’t lay down a foundation here, we won’t be prepared to meet that moment when it comes upon us. I don’t want to be caught flatfooted when the map shifts. If we do get caught flatfooted, we could be in a permanent minority for a long time.”
He cited research that showed public perceptions of the two political parties have changed. 
“A majority of Americans now believe that the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and poor and the Democratic Party is the party of the wealthy and elites. Just to prove the point, the only two groups we overperformed with in the presidential campaign were college-educated voters and wealthy households.
“That’s not sustainable,” the DNC chair said.
Democrats need to focus on an economic agenda that gives people some hope that better days are in front of them not behind them, he said. 
“It’s about focusing on an agenda that will give people a sense that we see them, we hear them and we’ve got some ideas on how we can actually improve your lives,” he added. “We have to give them a sense that we give a damn about them and their families and we’re going to fight for them.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ken-Martin-at-DNC-Exec-mtg-1024x576.png,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

As of early Friday evening, negotiators were still at work putting the finishing touches on Senate Bill 4, a sprawling piece of legislation that lawmakers hope will offer between $250 million and $500 million in direct savings to ratepayers by borrowing money to pay off portions of the public benefits charge on people’s bills.
But while members of both parties are in broad agreement on the need for legislation to lower prices, a debate over one provision of the bill, which addresses the powers of Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, has threatened to upend the precarious negotiations.
Republicans are demanding that Democratic leaders and the governor’s office, who are hammering out the bill’s language, alter a section of the bill they argue would concentrate more power with PURA’s leader, Marissa Gillett. As the session hurtles toward its constitutional deadline next Wednesday, their power to filibuster and ultimately block legislation only grows.
“I’d like to see something that is actually going to reduce energy costs,” House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, told reporters Friday. “I’m hopeful we’re going to get there but I’m not going to back down.”
The section in question first appeared in a draft of the bill that was circulated around the state Capitol last week. It would allow Gillett or her successor to assign a hearing officer to rule on “procedural, evidentiary and intermediate matters” in cases that appear before utility regulators.
Critics quickly noted that the language appears to touch on an issue that’s the subject of a lawsuit filed in January by the state’s two utility companies, Eversource and Avangrid. The lawsuit alleged Gillett has made herself, in essence, a hearing officer, issuing unilateral decisions in hundreds of matters dating back to 2020. In court filings, attorneys for the agency have rebutted those claims and argued Gillett has revised longstanding practices to provide for more input from her fellow commissioners.
The original text in the draft bill would have made the hearing officer language effective retroactive to Jan. 1, 2025 — before the lawsuit was filed — prompting Candelora to accuse Gillett of interfering in the bill-drafting process to give herself cover from the litigation.
Candelora said the objectionable language was initially was dropped from newer versions of the bill after concerns were raised last week, only to reemerge in recent days.
A spokeswoman for PURA said Gillett was presiding over a rate case on Friday and was not immediately available for comment. 
One of the key drafters of the legislation, state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, said the section of the bill in question originated from an effort by House members to address the ongoing dispute over administrative procedures between PURA and the utilities. Since then, the co-chair of the Energy and Technology Committee said it’s become a headache he’d rather not deal with.
“My position on this from the very beginning was even talking about this issue — which was a House ask to clarify procedure — even talking about it while there’s an ongoing lawsuit, is a bad idea,” Needleman said. 
Still, Needleman said the section remained a point of contention Friday and was one of the last remaining issues that needed to be resolved before lawmakers could read and vote on the bill. With the Senate planning to break for the weekend, the soonest a vote could happen is Monday. 
“I’m out of time,” Needleman said. “I don’t have a lot of negotiating space, I can’t drag this out.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, told reporters earlier Friday that the bill would need to have bipartisan support in order to make it through the House next week due to the dwindling amount of time left in the session and his desire to maintain what is a strong working relationship with Candelora, the Republican leader.
When asked about the origins of the language dealing with PURA, Ritter confirmed Needleman’s account that the section originated in the House with both Republican and Democratic support. However, he said it evolved beyond their initial idea after going through a comment process that involved members of Gov. Ned Lamont’s office, PURA and the Office of Consumer Counsel, among others.
Ritter said he also agreed with Needleman that the retroactive date in the language was made in error, and that it would be corrected in the final version of the bill.
“It was not a conspiracy,” Ritter said. “The original concept comes from the House, and we’re going to try to get it right, because it’s a big part of the bill.”
Candelora, meanwhile, said he would like to see the bill include language that would require any matter before PURA to be assigned to a panel of commissioners, who could then vote to appoint their own “presiding officer,” rather than leaving that decision up to the chair. He also reiterated his desire to have Lamont fill a pair of vacancies that have existed since the lawmakers expanded the number of PURA commissioners from three to five in 2019.
“There’s still a fundamental struggle with how much authority to give the chairman of PURA versus having the commission act as a panel,” Candelora said. 
Ritter said he shared Candelora’s concerns and remained hopeful that the two chambers could work out a compromise. Needleman, meanwhile, said he’s asked the Attorney General’s office to weigh in on the latest draft of the bill to ensure that any language dealing with PURA’s procedures does not interfere with ongoing litigation.
A spokeswoman for Attorney General William Tong said Friday afternoon the office was still waiting to see the latest language in the bill.
If either Tong’s office or members of the House object to that language, Needleman said he’s prepared to strip the section out of the bill altogether in hopes of getting to a final agreement. 
“Here’s the bottom line: This bill is about saving money. I’m trying to get to the maximum amount of savings for ratepayers,” Needleman said. “All the other stuff is superfluous.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0123_SR_PressConferences491-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

Street takeovers
On its second try, the House of Representatives passed a bill allowing municipalities to create regulations prohibiting street takeovers.
Debate over the bill was paused last week when Republicans brought up concerns about a part of the bill allowing municipalities to destroy ATVs and dirt-bikes that were seized by the police after violating municipal ordinances if the owner does not claim the vehicles within 30 days.
The amended bill increases the 30 days to 90, assuaging concerns that vehicle owners might not be able to locate an ATV within 30 days if the vehicle was stolen.
It also changes the penalty for multiple counts of participation in a street takeover from license forfeiture to a two-year license revocation and a $2,000 penalty.
Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott, one of four people who opposed the bill, said she was still concerned about a portion prohibiting people from gathering to observe a street takeover.
“My concern is that you see something going on in your neighborhood, in the area, and you’re curious … they can be fined for that. We can’t prohibit people from coming out of their houses and observing anything,” she said.
But Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, said the municipality would have to prove that the person gathered in the area for the purpose of watching the street takeover in order to enforce that.
The bill passed 144-4.

Sunday hunting
A bill to allow Sunday hunting on private lands advanced out of the House on Wednesday, despite the opposition of many in the majority party.
Hunters have spent years pushing to end restrictions on Sunday hunting, which critics have described as one of Connecticut’s last remaining “blue laws.” In 2015, lawmakers voted to allow a limited exception for bow hunting.
House Bill 7231 would go further, allowing Sunday hunting with firearms on private properties of at least 10 acres.
“We’ve talked about the concept for a little while… this year we’re taking a strong next step,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, the co-chair of the Environment Committee.
Opponents, however, argued that hunting would disrupt the activities of hikers and others who seek to get outdoors on Sundays. An amendment added to the bill just prior to Wednesday’s vote attempted to ease those concerns by restricting hunting within 40 yards of a blue-blazed hiking trail, even on private lands.
Still, the bill created divisions within the Democratic caucus.
“I am not satisfied, many of the people who testified over the years in front of the Environment Committee are not going to be satisfied with this 40-yard designation,” said state Rep. Mike Demicco, D-Farmington.
The House voted 101 to 45 to advance the bill on Wednesday, with all of the opposition coming from Democrats. It now heads to the Senate for further consideration.

Emergency voucher housing program
Most of Connecticut’s congressional delegation signed a letter urging the Appropriations Committee to continue funding the Emergency Voucher program, which helps thousands of people across the country pay for their housing, according to a news release sent Friday.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced earlier this year that it would discontinue the program, which offers rental aid to families experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. The department cited rising rents as the reason the program was becoming untenable.
“The EHV program provides rental assistance to help end and prevent homelessness,” the letter said. “At a time when housing costs and homelessness continue to rise, we respectfully request that you provide adequate funding in the FY26 THUD Appropriations bill to renew all EHVs to ensure that those who have been served by the program do not lose their housing support and to ensure landlords continue receiving the rental payments they depend on to maintain their properties.”
The program serves about 107,000 people across the country.
Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal signed the bill, as did Reps. Jim Himes, Jahana Hayes, Joe Courtney and John Larson.

HUSKY delivery
A bill that would ensure that the legislature is part of any change to the Medicaid delivery model passed through the Senate on Friday afternoon. Senate Bill 985 requires the commissioner of the Department of Social Services to submit any plans to change the payment model for Medicaid, called HUSKY in Connecticut, to legislative committees. Currently, the executive branch has authority to make such a change, through DSS.
Gov. Ned Lamont previously commissioned a study to investigate whether returning to a managed care Medicaid model would be more cost efficient. Even studying the possibility of a switch was met with fierce opposition. The resulting report found that Connecticut’s current system — a managed fee-for-service model — boasts lower costs and similar levels of access when compared to peer states. S.B. 985 is designed to ensure that lawmakers would have a say if the subject returns to the table in the future.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, D-Middletown, who is the co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said there is no issue that has attracted more interest across the nation this year than Medicaid.
“There are massive changes happening at the federal level, changes that we’re certainly concerned about in this building. And the question is, when considering major changes or changes to the HUSKY Health Program, should the legislature be at the table? And this bill seeks to make sure that it is.”

,DC,2025-05-30 23:09:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump sends detailed budget request cutting spending by $163 billion to Congress,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-sends-detailed-budget-request-cutting-spending-163-billion-congress,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration released significantly more detail about its budget request Friday evening, giving Congress the information it needs for lawmakers to draft the annual government funding bills.The 1,224-page document sheds light on where exactly President Donald Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought want lawmakers to cut federal spending during the upcoming fiscal year.The Office of Management and Budget released a “skinny” version of the annual proposal in early May, requesting lawmakers cut domestic spending by $163 billion and keep funding for defense programs flat in the dozen annual appropriations bills.While the documents in that request provided some insight into how Trump wants to reshape the size and scope of about $1.7 trillion in discretionary funding, which is spending that Congress directs, they didn’t include the level of detail that the Appropriations committees need to begin their work.The appendix document released Friday should aid in that, though it does not represent a full budget request. That type of proposal would include the White House’s goals for mandatory programs, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which make up about two-thirds of federal spending. Such spending is required by law and is not subject to annual appropriations.A full budget request also typically includes tax policy proposals, though with Republicans in Congress already working to enact an extension of the 2017 GOP tax law in the “big, beautiful bill,” those sections would likely be of little use to lawmakers at this point.Work on spending bills launchingThe House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to release and debate its 12 government funding bills throughout June, before voting to send those measures to the floor.Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., will likely include funding levels and policy closely aligned with the White House request, since legislation in that chamber can pass a floor vote with a simple majoritySenate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, has a more challenging task, since regular bills in that chamber require bipartisanship to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster. Republicans control the Senate with 53 members.In general, that means the Senate panel’s bills tend to look much more like the final version that becomes law than the House bills, though not always. Both chambers are supposed to reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the dozen bills before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1, but that rarely happens.Congress is much more likely to use a stopgap spending bill until mid-December to give members more time to negotiate funding levels and policies on thousands of government programs.The House and Senate were unable to reach agreement for this fiscal year, and instead leaned on a series of three continuing resolutions to keep the government up and running.Partial shutdown could loom againTensions over the proposed funding cuts in Trump’s first budget request of his second term could reach a boiling point if Cole, Collins, House ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Senate ranking member Patty Murray cannot broker an agreement before their deadline.Failure to enact some sort of government funding legislation — either the dozen full-year bills, or a stopgap spending measure — would lead to a partial government shutdown. Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Friday evening that it was “telling that President Trump has chosen to release his budget on a Friday night with no fanfare whatsoever.”“This is a draconian proposal to hurt working people and our economy, and it is dead on arrival in Congress as long as I have anything to say about it,” Murray wrote. “But this is just another reminder we need Republicans to join us to reject these reckless cuts, focus on the investments we actually need to make in our communities and security, and to finally force Trump to follow the law and end his devastating funding freeze.”DeLauro wrote in a statement that the ""government envisioned by President Trump only serves billionaires and the biggest corporations and would do nothing to lower the cost of living.”“This is not a complete budget,"" she wrote. ""We are supposed to start putting together the funding bills for 2026 next week. If, as expected, House Republicans follow what President Trump has proposed so far, it is not a serious effort to deliver for the American people.”",,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

The list was compiled in response to President Donald Trump’s April 28 executive order directing federal authorities to identify so-called sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide.

Photo courtesy of the Education Justice Coalition of VermontThe entire state of Vermont and three of its cities are listed on a new Department of Homeland Security list identifying so-called sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States — but Vermont officials say their policies adhere to federal immigration laws and help build trust with and reassure immigrants.Released Thursday night, the list of more than 500 cities and states identified as sanctuary cities, schools or states are seen by the Trump administration as “defying federal immigration law,” according to a Department of Homeland Security press release.“Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal illegal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in grave danger,” and the department is “committed to exposing these lawless jurisdictions to the public and making them accountable for not respecting the rule of law,” the release stated.The list was compiled in response to President Donald Trump’s April 28 executive order directing federal authorities to identify so-called sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide that are “deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The Trump administration has threatened to suspend or end federal funds to those schools, cities or states.While Vermont has not declared itself as a sanctuary state, it “maintains full compliance with federal law while protecting the Constitutional rights of citizens and the State,” Amanda Wheeler, Gov. Phil Scott’s spokesperson, wrote in a Friday email. “This means, Vermont doesn’t stand in the way of the federal government carrying out federal immigration laws in Vermont,” she wrote.After considerable delays and pressure from immigrant advocacy groups, the state last year updated its fair and impartial policing policy that aims to reduce bias based on citizenship status.READ MORE
The governor in 2017, however, signed legislation days after then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatened to revoke law enforcement funding from sanctuary cities and states that block police from telling federal authorities about unauthorized immigrants in their custody.The 2017 guidelines provide an outline for municipalities to consider when adopting policies on municipal law enforcement interactions with federal immigration officials. A fact sheet put out by Scott further stresses “Vermont’s response does not put federal dollars at risk because it does not establish Vermont as a ‘sanctuary jurisdiction.’”After families and staff in Vermont’s most diverse school district strongly advocated for the measure, the Winooski School District in February became the first in Vermont to pass a sanctuary school policy that remains active and compliant with existing law, according to Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria.Winooski “continues to abide by its policy to affirmatively protect the rights of students and families regardless of their immigration status and to take proactive measures to educate our community of those rights,” he wrote in an email Friday. “Our policies and procedures are respectful of the law and while we monitor ‘demands’ from the Trump administration, we will be ready to comply only when those demands have a sufficient legal basis. As of this moment, our policy remains within the law,” Chavarria added.The Department of Homeland Security release contained no details, but local authorities believe the administration will target policies that restrict federal immigration authorities from accessing property and information. This could apply to existing sanctuary city or school guidelines as well as fair and impartial policing guidelines in Vermont.Montpelier and Burlington have both in place.Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said Friday the city’s fair and impartial policing policy, aimed at preventing discrimination in law enforcement and preventing officers from enforcing civil immigration law, does not violate federal law and is needed “to keep our community safe.”Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak on Friday, April 4. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“Burlington, like other communities identified as sanctuary jurisdictions, has a proud history of welcoming immigrants and refugees,” she said in a press release issued Friday afternoon. “We will not back down from ensuring the safety of all who live, work and visit our community.”Such policies help build trust between immigrant communities and police departments and ensure “people can call for help without fear of discrimination based on immigration status,” Mulvaney-Stanak added. The Burlington School District has not declared itself a sanctuary school, but it did issue guidelines regarding federal immigration efforts to staff in January and partnered with local agencies to educate new American families about their rights. Superintendent Tom Flanagan said he is concerned about the Homeland Security directive. He is not sharing details about the agencies the district has partnered with to help immigrant families in order to protect them.“Thankfully, no deportations have occurred in schools or on school grounds. We continue to work closely with families and community partners to make sure they feel safe and understand their rights,” he said in an emailed statement Friday. “Families and staff understand that we cannot keep anyone 100% safe from illegal deportation and they have told us they are grateful for the steps we have and continue to take.”“We also believe we continue to do what is morally right and that we are operating in a way that complies with federal and state law,” he wrote.Montpelier adopted its sanctuary city resolution in 2016 affirming that local law enforcement willnot enforce federal immigration policy at the request of the federal government. The capital has also adopted a fair and impartial policing policy modeled after the state policy that makes clear “enforcement of civil immigration law is a federal responsibility, and establishes that the Montpelier Police Department (MPD) shall not engage in such enforcement,” City Manager Bill Fraser said in a Friday press release.The Homeland Security release claiming sanctuary jurisdictions “protect violent criminal illegal aliens” comes a day after the second large-scale immigration enforcement incident in Vermont in just two months.Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials detained 10 people in the town of Newport Thursday after they finished work at a construction site nearby. Some were carrying proof of their immigration status and are being scheduled for release. The status of the other detainees is not yet clear.Last month, ICE detained nine migrant workers at a dairy farm in Berkshire, four of whom have already been deported to Mexico. Three others were released Friday, according to a press release from Migrant Justice.READ MORE
Molly Gray, executive director of the Burlington-based nonprofit Afghan Alliance, wrote in an email that the sanctuary list is intended to “intimidate Vermonters through fear and coercion.”“This administration may be comfortable with violating due process, and unlawfully targeting immigrants and refugees but Vermonters are not and won’t have any part in it. This Administration might abandon its promise and responsibility to Afghan Allies, but Vermonters will not,” she wrote.The Homeland Security release is “another attempt from the federal government to force private and public institutions into “voluntarily” changing their conduct, policies, or practices—even when institutions’ rights and responsibilities, and the law, have not actually changed,” Falko Schilling, advocacy director of the ACLU of Vermont, said in an emailed statement.Presidential executive orders cannot change laws, Schilling said. He said the Trump administration is “trying to use its executive power to pressure institutions into pre-emptive compliance with its policy goals in an end run around not only Congress, but the autonomy of individual states.”Some states and advocacy groups across the country have been challenging presidential orders, arguing they are unconstitutional, particularly around immigration as the Trump administration carries out a promise to ramp up mass deportations.A federal court in Vermont has played a central role, most recently helping to free detained Palestinian student Mohsen Mahdawi and pause the transfer of detained student Rümeysa Öztürk.Students at Champlain Valley Union High School last week staged a “hands off” walkout in protest of the impact of the federal government’s immigration enforcement policies. An early suspension of a parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans led two Nicaraguan students to leave the country by the end of April.“We’ve heard from students, educators, and community members, students can’t learn if they don’t feel safe. No student should have to fear for their friends, family, or their own safety in the presence of immigration officials, especially in a place of learning. Sanctuary school policies make schools safer for all students,” said Kayla Loving, a coordinator at the Education Justice Coalition of Vermont that helped draft a K-12 sanctuary school policy used by Winooski.This is not the first time Vermont communities have faced federal threats over their sanctuary status. In 2018, the U.S Department of Justice sent letters to 28 cities and states, including the state of Vermont and city of Burlington, warning they may not be in compliance with federal immigration law.None of the communities named in the Department of Homeland Security list had received letters as of Friday.Attorney General Charity Clark on June 18, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont Attorney General Charity Clark, who continues to join other states in a growing list of legal actions challenging Trump administration actions, said this list is no surprise. She said her office is prepared and will continue to fight for the rule of law and the rights of Vermonters.“Any Vermont official who receives a notice as a result of this list should continue to follow state laws and policies, which are in compliance with federal law and designed to build the trust necessary to protect public safety,” Clark said in an emailed statement. “It’s the federal government’s responsibility to enforce immigration laws, and state and local law enforcement should remain focused on public safety in our communities.”The crackdown on immigration has many immigrant families nervous and on edge, according to Shabnam Nolan, executive director of the King Street Center, a community center that serves youth in Burlington.“We continue to hear worry, even from those with legal status, about their safety amid recent federal statements. When any statement or action — whether from institutions or individuals — casts doubt on belonging, children feel it first. We hear their questions. We see their fear. And we hold space for their hope,” Nolan said Friday.The center’s role, she said, is to provide stability and connection to every child and caregiver. “And no matter what, we will continue to play this role,” Nolan said. “We remain committed to listening deeply, responding thoughtfully, and standing alongside our families through uncertainty and beyond.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont sanctuary jurisdictions respond to Homeland Security list, say policies comply with federal law.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/champlain-valley-high-school-protest-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

The footage shows that after calling 911 to report an armed burglar dressed in all black, a woman met officers at her door in that same style of clothing and pointed a handgun at them.
The post Body cam footage shows Casper homeowner raising gun at officers responding to 911 call appeared first on WyoFile .","A woman shot and killed by police in April raised a handgun in the direction of officers after meeting them at the door of her central Casper home, body camera footage released Friday by the Casper Police Department shows.
The woman called police to her own home just after midnight on April 28 on a report of an armed burglar that appears to be false.
The footage, which includes a warning that viewer discretion is advised, shows that after calling 911 to report an armed burglar dressed in all black, 37-year-old Jody Cobia met officers at the door to her home in that same style of clothing, holding a handgun. “Where the fuck are my children?” Cobia yelled as she stepped toward the officers and raised a handgun in their direction. 
Cobia is a mother of three, but did not appear to have custody of her children, according to court records previously reviewed by WyoFile. Police found no one else in the home, the video shows.
When Cobia raised the gun, officers expressed surprise and stepped back while two of them fired, according to the body camera footage released late Friday afternoon. The two officers fired five rounds over two seconds, according to narration by the department included in the footage. 
Four officers responded to the burglary report initially. After shooting Cobia, they searched the rest of the house, and did not find any evidence of an intruder. Department officials had previously told the public there was no indication that Cobia’s report of a burglar was accurate and that they believe she made the call to draw police to her home. 
After searching the home, officers and paramedics provide life-saving measures to Cobia, but the first officers to reach her say on the body camera footage that they can’t feel her pulse. Immediately after shooting Cobia, some officers moved to enter the home, but a supervisor on scene told them to wait for about 15 seconds, while he yelled into the house and tried to ascertain if anyone else was home. 
Officers take time to make sure no one else is in the house, including the possible armed burglar, and do not begin to give Cobia medical attention until around eight minutes after she was shot. 
In the audio of the 911 call, a woman, presumably Cobia, tells dispatch someone “armed and dangerous” had broken into her house. The audio of the call released Friday does not identify the caller as Cobia, but the department said she made the call in its May 7 release. 
“He’s wearing all black,” the caller says. “Please show up.” 
She repeatedly tells the dispatcher to “hurry up,” but is not whispering into the phone on the call. “He’s inside,” the caller says, “please get inside. Please get over here.” 
The caller tells the dispatcher the burglar is in a back room of the house, after previously saying she herself was in that same room. That appears to give the dispatcher pause. “And you’re in the back room?” the dispatcher asks the caller. 
“Yeah, I’m running away from him,” the caller says. She ends the call shortly after that. 
Officers arrived on scene about three minutes after the 911 call, which began one minute after midnight. Body camera footage then shows four officers approaching the house, shining flashlights along exterior walls and windows as they do so. 
When an officer nears the door, Cobia appears to open it before he can knock. The pistol police say she held is difficult to make out in the body camera footage, but she appears to be holding it down by her waist as she opens the door. She then swings it up toward the officer’s head and takes hold of it in both hands as she yells about her children. Police fire at her immediately after that. 
The incident remains under review by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation, according to the Casper Police Department. After that inquiry, the case will be sent to the Natrona County District Attorney’s Office, which will decide whether the shooting was justified.

Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, gestures across the table as House and Senate members of the education reform bill conference committee meet at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 30, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerYou couldn’t walk 10 steps under the golden dome Friday without someone asking if we were getting out of here today. Legislative lawyers are under-rested and over-extended. Lawmakers have skipped too many meals. And everyone has a pet theory — so-and-so wants a delay, someone has a secret proposal they’re waiting to unveil. But it’s not looking good, folks, thanks to the ed bill. Here’s how it was going down (so far). After a stalled morning, the H.454 conferees gathered for a brief meeting after 11. Despite an air of pessimism preceding the discussion, both sides expressed willingness to compromise on key issues that threatened to delay the day. The surprise came later. I’ll get to that. House members, for their part, signaled a willingness to consider allowing districts to spend less than the amount a foundation formula would provide in full. Senate members suggested they would consider the House’s version of a property tax credit, which would significantly expand eligibility and relief over the existing system but cost more overall. Reaching agreement looked much less likely hours later. When the group returned at 2:45 with the Senate’s latest draft, there were some new ideas. Quite a few. For example, a potential expansion of school choice. Components of a foundation formula pulled from a couple of weeks ago. And if districts can’t pass a budget by a certain date, they get 90% of a foundation formula rather than the full thing — unless they’re a fully non-operating district, in which case they don’t have to vote and get 100% of the foundation formula. As the surprises arrived, both conferees and spectators struggled to control their shock. Eyebrows raised, one lobbyist leaned to the next and mouthed, “this is wild.”The new language proliferated throughout the Senate’s proposal — but was not in the chamber’s original bill, the House’s version or the governor’s recommendations. With frustration palpable, Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, chair of the House Education Committee, called for a recess. When the group reconvened at 5 p.m., the Senators first appeared to pull their large changes off the table, before clarifying that most of it was still in play.“Do you believe passing this tonight is the right answer?” Conlon asked the Senate members, holding up the afternoon surprise. Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, appeared to nod. But Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, was less sure.“I don’t know if that is the right answer. That was 15-minute at lunch’s attempt to come up with an answer,” she said. Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, spoke up. “We had a bill that was one caucus all the way through, and now we’ve got to square it up with both caucasus and a Republican governor. So I guess, let’s dig in.”— Ethan WeinsteinOn the moveAfter several days of acrimonious debate, the House and Senate reached a deal on this year’s housing bill, S.127, on Friday afternoon. Scott administration officials indicated that the Republican governor will support it. The chambers each accepted the compromise and passed the bill by early evening.The bulk of the disagreement between the two chambers centered around a new infrastructure financing program for housing development, which would leverage the increased tax revenue from new construction to pay back loans for infrastructure like water lines, roads and sidewalks. The House had added a host of guardrails to the initiative in an effort to protect foregone property tax revenue from the Education Fund. The Senate — and the Scott administration — had pushed for fewer rules, arguing that a more flexible version of the initiative would help add more homes to the grand list and spread out the burden of rising education costs.Tensions ran high during a conference committee this week as the two sides sparred, leaving observers to wonder whether lawmakers might walk away from the negotiating table. But by Friday afternoon, they settled their differences on a few key points: they agreed to significantly raise a cap on the amount of tax-increment a state council can approve for new projects each year, and they scrapped a previously-added sunset to Vermont’s existing, larger-scale tax increment financing program.The crowded room erupted in applause when House members agreed to Senate members’ last offer.“Thank you for this step – for really creating a new tool for housing creation,” said Sen. Alison Clarkson, D-Windsor.— Carly BerlinThe House on Friday morning approved a Senate proposal to push back the effective date of a proposed cap on the cost of outpatient pharmaceutical drugs. The measure, included in H.266, was originally proposed by the House with a transitional cap beginning July 1. But the Senate nixed that initial cap, settling only on a slightly lower cap that would take effect next January.Supporters have said a cap on outpatient pharmaceuticals could provide the most immediate relief to health care insurance costs of any measure lawmakers have considered this year. The bill now heads to Gov. Phil Scott for his consideration. — Shaun RobinsonA bill that would overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness is also headed to Gov.

The Connecticut Senate on Friday overwhelmingly passed the most significant reform to the state’s towing policies in decades, a measure lawmakers said would help protect drivers from predatory towing.
House Bill 7162 overhauls the state’s century-old towing statutes and comes in response to an investigation by the Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that showed how state towing laws have come to favor tow companies at the expense of drivers. It takes several steps to make it harder to tow vehicles from private property and easier for drivers to retrieve their vehicles after a tow.
The bill, which passed the House of Representatives last week with wide bipartisan support and little debate, sailed through the Senate on a 33-3 vote.
“It’s reform that ensures transparency, it ensures fairness and accountability, but does all of this without undercutting the essential work that ethical and professional tow operators do each and every day for us, keeping our roads safe and our properties accessible,” said Transportation Committee Co-chair Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford. “We’ve learned over the years, and particularly over the last year due to some investigative reporting, of some particularly egregious circumstances.”
A spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont said the governor plans to sign the bill into law.
Republican Sen. Tony Hwang, ranking member of the Transportation Committee, also spoke in favor of the bill. The bill got about a half hour of debate ahead of passage, and there were no comments in opposition.
Hwang, who represents Fairfield, said the bill strikes the right balance between the interests of towers and consumers.
“I want to acknowledge that our press had an important part to bring out transparency and some of the bad actions, and I think in this bill we address some of those issues,” Hwang said. “We took measures to ensure that there is due process, and what has been discovered to have occurred in a criminal action, I believe, should never, ever happen again, to undermine the trust that we have to have in this process.”
Connecticut’s law allows tow companies to begin the process to sell vehicles after just 15 days. CT Mirror and ProPublica found that it is one of the shortest windows in the nation, and that the law has particularly impacted people with low incomes. Reporters spoke with people who said towing companies required them to pay in cash or wouldn’t allow them to get personal belongings out of their vehicles. Many couldn’t afford to get their towed vehicles back and lost transportation or jobs because of it.
After weeks of negotiations, lawmakers said they came to a compromise with the towing industry. Two bills were merged to include massive reforms to towing procedures from private property and rate increases for highway tows that typically follow car accidents.
The bill that passed and would take effect Oct. 1 requires tow companies to accept credit cards and doesn’t allow them to tow vehicles immediately just because of an expired parking permit or registration. Vehicles can’t be towed from private property without notice unless they’re blocking traffic, fire hydrants or parked in an accessible spot.
Under the bill, towing companies can still start the sales process for vehicles worth $1,500 or less after 15 days, but they would now have to take more steps to give the owner a chance to claim the vehicle. The Department of Motor Vehicles would be required to check whether the driver filed any complaints about the tow before approving the sale, and the tower would have to send a notice ahead of the sale to the registered owner and lienholders via certified mail, with receipts of delivery.
The actual sale couldn’t go through until 30 days after the tow.
The bill also requires that towers take at least two photos before they tow a vehicle — one of the violation that resulted in a tow and another of any damage to the vehicle. Cohen said this would help determine if vehicles had any missing parts before the tow, a seeming nod to the news organizations’ story about a DMV employee who the agency’s investigators found schemed with a towing company to undervalue vehicles and sell them for thousands in profit. (The employee denied he did anything wrong, and the agency ultimately took no action in that case.)
The bill also establishes a working group to study how to handle proceeds from the sales of towed vehicles. State law requires that towing companies hold profits in escrow for a year in case the vehicle owner claims them, then remit that money to the state. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found the DMV never set up a system for that process to occur.
Additionally, it calls for the DMV to work with the state’s attorney general to develop a consumer bill of rights on towing.
Tow companies have to be available after hours and on weekends to allow people to get their vehicles or personal property. In a story published this month, CT Mirror and ProPublica reported that tow truck companies sometimes hold onto people’s belongings to pressure them into paying their towing fees.
Under the new law, drivers will be allowed to retrieve their belongings from their vehicles, even if they haven’t paid the towing fees. State regulations currently allow vehicle owners to retrieve only “personal property which is essential to the health or welfare of any person.”
Cohen listed many of the issues outlined in the news outlets’ reporting as “some of the worst abuses of predatory towing practices.”
Timothy Vibert, president of Towing and Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said the industry initially opposed the bill because towers believed it would impede their ability to tow cars and clear traffic. He also said towers weren’t involved enough in the original draft. But they worked with lawmakers on the bill over several weeks, and he issued a statement in support this week.
“The people of Connecticut deserve safety, accountability and transparency when their cars are towed, and so do the people who work for Connecticut’s towing companies who risk our lives every day to make our roads safe,” Vibert said. “We all need clear, easy-to-follow rules.”
DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera commended the House and Senate.
“The DMV fully supports this initiative, as it not only enhances the framework for fair and equitable enforcement of towing laws but also provides a clear path forward for our agency to advance these efforts,” Guerrera said in a statement.
Cohen said that the bill aims to “fix a broken process,” and that lawmakers had worked on some aspects of it for years before the bill passed.
News of the bill’s passage brought relief to Melissa Anderson, who was featured in a CT Mirror and ProPublica story after her car was towed and sold from her Hamden apartment because of an expired parking permit.
The bill requires a 72-hour grace period before a car can be towed for an expired parking sticker to allow people time to get a new one.
“I’m glad we made a difference,” Anderson said. “This is going to help a lot of people.”
The bill next heads to Lamont’s desk.
“The Governor appreciates all the work that went into this legislation, which provides greater protections for the public and their vehicles,” Lamont’s spokesperson, Rob Blanchard, said in a text message. “He plans on signing the legislation once it reaches his desk.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_SenateTowingBill_121-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 19:05:52.978540

Greg Gianforte vetoed a “river census” bill, arguing the work to collect data can be done in a “more cost effective manner,” but the sponsor said a special revenue account has the money, and Montana needs clarity about river use.
House Bill 762 would require Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks to produce a report of all watercraft, from rafts to inflatable flamingoes, along 966 miles of 16 rivers in the state.
Rep. Joshua Seckinger, a river guide, said the legislation is necessary because rivers are busy, and attempts have been made to regulate them, but with only anecdotal evidence, not hard data.
In his veto letter, however, Gianforte argued the cost of the river census was much too high, and the project too large, although he said the bill is “well intended.”
“House Bill 762 drains $2.6 million from the state parks account, which would otherwise be used to address important infrastructure projects at our state parks, including maintenance backlogs,” Gianforte said in his veto letter.
The bill had bipartisan sponsorship. It earned 102 approvals altogether in its final votes in both chambers — 29 in the Senate and 73 in the House.

Support from two thirds of the Montana Legislature triggers an automatic veto override poll from the Secretary of State.
Friday, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office could not be reached via email about the status of polling. Friday, the bill wasn’t among the list of those currently being polled.
However, in a letter to his colleagues, Seckinger, D-Bozeman, said he hopes they consider overriding the veto. He said he respectfully disagrees with the governor’s assessment the bill “took too big a bite at the apple.”
“First, there is no additional cost to taxpayers,” Seckinger wrote. “The bill would have been funded entirely from a special revenue account within FWP, which is supported by vehicle registration fees, the cannabis excise tax, and state park registrations.
“Even with HB 762, this fund would have had a $6 million ending balance. Without the bill, the fund’s balance will now grow to $8.6 million — unused, and continuing to expand.”
In a phone call with the Daily Montanan, Seckinger said he agreed the cost “was not insignificant.”
But if fiscal conservatism is the goal, he said, he would advocate for lowering license plate fees, cannabis taxes, and the other sources of funds for the account.
In his letter, Seckinger also said the bill would have provided a “comprehensive understanding of river use,” and objective, baseline data is needed — “and we need it soon.”
(A separate study out of Montana State University will review popular river stretches not included in the bill.)
In his veto letter, Gianforte, a Republican, agreed that river usage “has increased dramatically in recent years.”
However, he said he believes the state can achieve the same goal over a longer period, potentially using a pilot program to study a portion of the river stretches in the bill.
“The idea of a pilot program is just an example, and over the course of the interim, I look forward to working with the bill sponsor, members of the Legislature, and FWP officials to find a more cost effective way of addressing this important need,” Gianforte said in the letter.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/61CED28A-14EE-495A-B106-057924317CC1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 19:05:52.978540

Montana, filed suit in U.S. District Court on Thursday against the federal government over a series of climate and energy policies.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Lighthiser v. Trump, argue three of Trump’s executive orders issued earlier this year to “unleash” the fossil fuel industry and remove climate protections threaten their constitutional rights to life and liberty. 
“President Trump’s EOs falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives,” the lawsuit states. “These unconstitutional directives have the immediate effect of slowing the buildout of U.S. energy infrastructure that eliminates planet-heating fossil fuel greenhouse gas pollution … and increasing the use of fossil fuels that pollute the air, water, lands, and climate on which Plaintiffs’ lives depend.”
The lead plaintiff, 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser, from Livingston, is one of several Montana plaintiffs who also filed the landmark Held case, which prevailed in Montana District Court and, in late 2024, in the Montana Supreme Court. Lighthiser is joined in the suit by Rikki Held, Lander and Badge Busse — sons of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ryan Busse — and five others from the Montana lawsuit, as well as young people from Hawai‘i, Oregon, California, and Florida. 
Plaintiffs from Hawai’i were also involved in a successful youth-led climate lawsuit against the state’s Department of Transportation. 
During a seven-day bench trial before Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Kathy Seeley in 2023, Held and 15 youth plaintiffs were found to have a right to a stable climate system under Montana’s constitutional right to a “clean and healthful environment.”
The Held decision, affirmed by the state Supreme Court in December, is mentioned numerous times in the Lighthiser case, and several of the same law firms are representing the plaintiffs in the new suit.

Eleven federal agencies and their respective agency heads, including the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA, are named as defendants along with the president. 
Three of Trump’s executive orders — 14156, 14154 and 14261 — declare a “national energy emergency” and direct numerous federal agencies to “unleash American energy” by accelerating oil, gas and coal production on federal lands, and bolster fossil fuel development. They also roll back funding that bolstered climate protections, including through the Inflation Reduction Act. Various clean energy grant programs, including wind, solar battery storage and electric vehicles, were also targeted in the orders. 
The 126-page complaint argues that the federal directives threaten the plaintiffs’ health and wellbeing by accelerating harms from the fossil fuel industry and climate change. 
“Plaintiffs were born into and now live in a destabilized climate system. Fossil fuel pollution has created this emergency—a dangerous situation for Plaintiffs requiring immediate action,” the suit states. “… EPA reports that climate change effects, including heat, displacement, financial or food insecurity, loss of recreation, loss of sleep, and risk of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), harm children’s health.”
The plaintiffs are asking for the court to find the three executive orders “and any implementing executive actions” unlawful, unconstitutional and invalid, and seek a permanent injunction against implementing and enforcing the orders. 
In a statement, Deputy White House press secretary Harrison Fields said the executive orders are part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to protect Americans.
“Promoting domestic energy production is crucial for shielding American families from price volatility and securing a stable energy supply for our nation and its allies. The President has a proven history of bolstering American energy production and will restore our nation’s position as a global energy leader,” Fields said in a statement.
A representative for the Department of Justice declined to comment. 
In a press release about the lawsuit, Lighthiser said Trump’s executive orders amount to a “death sentence for my generation.” 
“I’m not suing because I want to — I’m suing because I have to. My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. He’s waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we’re fighting back with the Constitution.” 
In the suit, the plaintiffs list harms experienced in their young lives related to climate change, including from longer wildfire seasons that affect their health, increasingly extreme weather patterns that affect their livelihoods, and changes to their local environments and cultural homes. The suit also mentions the executive orders’ effect on decreasing career opportunities for some plaintiffs, through canceled climate science research and study programs. 
The complaint also condemns the federal government’s directives to implement the executive orders by “a wholesale scrubbing, suppression and dismantling of government agencies’ climate science, thereby blinding the government,” and argues that the  President exceeded his constitutional and statutory authority— “acting ultra vires” — in issuing the executive orders. 
The youth are represented by Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based law firm, along with Gregory Law Group, McGarvey Law in Kalispell, and Public Justice. 
l“These young plaintiffs refuse to be collateral damage in a fossil fuel war on their future,” lead attorney Julia Olson of Our Children’s Trust said in a press release. “They are demanding accountability where it still matters—in a court of law. The executive branch is not above the Constitution, and these young people are here to prove it.”

Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) renewed his call for the Upper Pecos watershed to be protected from mining claims in a letter sent recently to the top federal forestry official.
In the May 23 letter to U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, Heintch notes that watershed is crucial for fishing, agriculture and traditional uses, but “has a history of poorly managed mining projects.”
He noted New Mexico officials are still cleaning up pollution from a 1991 spill when snowmelt flooded an abandoned mine. The slurry spilled into the Pecos River and killed thousands of fish across 11 miles. New Mexico has spent millions of dollars on the cleanup, which remains ongoing.
“I would like to extend an invitation to you to visit New Mexico and the Pecos area so you can hear firsthand from local leaders, Tribes, community members, farmers, business owners, recreationists, and others while experiencing the beauty of this watershed,” Heinrich wrote. “While there, you can see why this river is so valuable and witness the very real threat of mining pollution that still exists.”
The invitation comes as the Trump Administration reversed a decision to temporarily ban new mining development in the Upper Pecos made in December, prompting rebuke from members of the delegation, local officials and Pueblos of Jemez and Tesuque. 
Heinrich’s letter contained additional entreaties from tribal leaders to visit, so Schultz can better understand the region’s importance.
“Water is the blood of the Pueblo and all nearby communities. We cannot afford to again
place our life-giving waters in the hands of foreign-owned mining corporations,” wrote Tesuque Gov. Earl Samuel in a separate letter.
Emails to the U.S. Department of Agriculture requesting comment about the letter and any response from Schultz went unreturned Friday.
Luis Soriano, a spokesperson for Heinrich, said the office had not received a response to the letter as of Friday afternoon.

(Getty Images)Amid national outbreaks, a confirmed measles case hasn’t yet hit Utah — but as nearby states report cases, the highly contagious virus could be closing in. 
Meanwhile, Utah’s childhood vaccination rates have been on a steady decline for years. 
Local and state public health officials say it’s likely a matter of time before the Beehive State gets its first measles case, and they’re bracing for if or when it happens. 
“We’re always looking at cases in other states,” Rich Lakin, immunization program manager at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, told Utah News Dispatch this week. “We’ve been ready for a long time, but so far so good. We haven’t had any cases here in Utah.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But to be prepared, Lakin said state public health officials are working with local health departments, clinics, and physicians to ensure they know how to quickly identify a measles case and properly handle it when someone comes in for treatment. 
Nic Rupp, spokesperson for the Salt Lake County Health Department, said county health officials “monitor the status nationwide every day.” 
“We will likely see a case locally as infections get closer geographically and as people travel more this summer,” Rupp said.
In the meantime, he said the Salt Lake County Health Department is encouraging populations with low rates for the MMR vaccine (which protects against measles, mumps and rubella) to get up to date on their shots as part of efforts to minimize the spread of the virus “when a case does show up here.” 
The last reported measles infection in Utah was reported in March 2023, according to state health officials. 
“A person who was not vaccinated traveled outside the U.S. and brought measles back to Utah,” the state’s website says. “We do not believe anyone else in Utah got measles from this person.” 
Before that 2023 case, three people in Utah had measles in February 2017. 
Outbreaks
So far this year Utah’s neighboring state of Colorado has confirmed five cases, according to NBC News’ outbreak tracker. New Mexico has seen 79 cases, 14 of which have been reported in the last four weeks. In Texas, 753 cases have been confirmed, with 60 reported in the last four weeks. 
NM measles cases rise to 78, with possible exposures at Santa Fe and Albuquerque Walmarts

As of Thursday, a total of 1,088 confirmed measles cases have been reported in 2025 from 33 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
Fourteen outbreaks have been reported so far in 2025, and 90% of those confirmed cases (977 of 1,088) have been outbreak associated, according to the CDC. For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024, and 69% of cases (198 of 285) were outbreak associated. 
Utah’s vaccination rate is dropping, on pace with regional declines
For several years now, Utah health officials have tracked a decline in the state’s early childhood MMR vaccinations. 
According to the state’s immunization dashboard, the percentage of Utah children that received at least one dose of the MRR vaccine at 24 months old has dropped from 94.5% of those born in 2019 to 89.8% of those born in 2021. 
“It has dropped,” Lakin said. 
  (Courtesy of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services)
He pointed out that the region, which also includes the states of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, has gone from a 98.3% for the birth year of 2019 “all the way down to 86.4%.”
“So the region as a whole is not doing very well,” he said. That concerns public health officials because travelers tend to visit nearby states, “anytime you get cases in other states, then it increases our chances of getting a measles case here in Utah.” 
The ideal vaccination rate to reach herd immunity protection against measles is 95%, he said. Young children are also most at risk if they contract the virus. 
“The thing that would concern us the most would be for an adult to get measles, and then you pass it to a 6-month-old that hasn’t been vaccinated yet,” he said. 
The state’s dashboard is currently using the latest available data from 2023, Lakin said, but state officials are working to update it soon with 2024 data. Health officials expect that Utah’s immunization rate has continued to decline. 
“The expectation is, yes, it is continuing to decline,” he said, though he added, “by how much, I do not know yet.” 
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

State 2023 data shows public school districts tend to have higher immunization rates than charter schools. In Salt Lake County, Canyons, Granite, Jordan, Murray and Salt Lake City school districts, all had more than 95% immunization rates for the second dose of MMR vaccine in K-12 schools, compared to 91.8% in charter schools. 
However, according to that data, only 92.3% of kindergartners in Salt Lake County are up to date on measles vaccination — below the ideal 95% herd immunity threshold. 
Last year, Axios reported Utah has one of the nation’s highest rates of childhood vaccine waivers. Religious exemptions accounted for the fastest-rising share of exemptions since before the pandemic, accounting for 13% of Utah’s waivers last year, up from 5.9% in 2019, according to a state report released last year. The vast majority, however, are attributed to “personal belief,” accounting for 84.9% of the waivers in the 2023 to 2024 school year. 
Measles vaccine is safe and saves lives
Given the troubling pattern of declining vaccination rates across Utah and other states amid deepening distrust of institutions in the U.S., Lakin acknowledged its “difficult” to encourage people to vaccinate their children, but he said health officials will continue to try to ensure Utahns get accurate information. 
“Look at the history,” he said, adding that back in the 1800s, “if your child lived to be an adult, you were very happy. Because they either got smallpox or they got measles or they got mumps, or they got rubella, tetanus, or diphtheria. … I mean, think of all these vaccine preventable diseases that we just don’t see anymore, and it’s because of vaccinations.”
Nonpartisan poll finds ‘remarkably low’ trust in federal health agencies

Lakin said “unfortunately people are losing sight of what these vaccinations are doing and getting the wrong information in such a fast-paced world that we live in now.” 
“They’re not getting the right information anymore,” he said. “That’s what our continued message is — that vaccinations have been one of the greatest public health achievements we have seen, and we want to continue to keep people safe through vaccinations.” 
In a news release issued back in February — after Texas announced the first death of a school-aged child from measles — the Salt Lake County Health Department urged people to ensure they’re protected. 
“For decades, the MMR vaccine has been proven safe and effective,” said Dorothy Adams, executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department. “Ensuring now that you and your loved ones are adequately protected will help prevent serious illness in our community if this current multistate measles outbreak spreads to Utah.” 
Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known, and it can be so easily spread that people who are not immune have a 90% chance of catching it if they go near an infected person. Someone with measles can spread it to others even before they know they are ill, and the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area.  
Salt Lake County health officials said the best protection against measles is to be immunized with two doses of the MMR vaccine, which can prevent more than 97% of measles infections. In the remaining 3% of cases — when a fully vaccinated person catches measles — the symptoms are milder, the illness is shorter, and the infected person is less likely to spread it. 
Unvaccinated people, including children who are too young to be vaccinated, are more likely to experience severe complications from a measles infection. 



How to know if you’re up to date on measles shots
Measles vaccine recommendations vary based on age and vaccination history. Here’s what public health experts recommend: 

Children should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. 
Adults born before 1957 generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. 
Adults who were vaccinated before 1968 should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963 to 1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. 
Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (college students, health care workers, international travelers) should have two doses.

(Courtesy of Los Alamos National Laboratory)As New Mexico water and fire managers prepare for increased drought and wildfire danger this summer, Los Alamos National Laboratory officials say the lab has taken steps to mitigate those threats on its campus.
LANL provided a media tour mid-week to highlight those steps, but did not allow outside photography or recording.
“We’re very proud of our preparedness efforts for wildfire,” said Deputy Laboratory Director of Operations Mark Davis from the floor of the Emergency Operations Center, as videos of the 2022 Cerro Pelado fire played across six screens on the wall. “We want to show our efforts to communicate how our mitigation efforts will protect the lab, workforce, community and environment.”
The state has identified the towns of Los Alamos and White Rock as high risk areas for wildfire threats, including LANL, which spans 36 square miles of mesas and canyons. The lab and surrounding town have been evacuated twice in the past 30 years due to fires. That included evacuations for two weeks during the Cerro Grande Fire in 2000, which burned 43,000 acres total, including 45 lab buildings and 7,500 acres of LANL property. Los Alamos evacuated for another 10 days during the 2011 Las Conchas fire, which burned more than 156,000 acres, though only one acre on the lab’s property.
In 2022, during the same time the Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon fires raged, the Cerro Pelado fire, also caused by a controlled burn, sparked up and ultimately burned 45,000 acres, requiring the lab to move to remote work in preparation for an evacuation.
In 2022, at the request of the Biden Administration, LANL released its Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and Resilience Plan, which showed that increased wildfire presented the highest risks to equipment, electricity systems, onsite radioactive waste processing, buildings, water systems and communications systems.
Critics say climate threats to the laboratory are compounding. LANL’s proposed thinning is “a slow job, but certainly necessary,” said Greg Mello, the executive director of nuclear nonproliferation nonprofit Los Alamos Study Group. But he said the hazards with climate change are stacking up.
“We just wish that the laboratory wasn’t straining against every single environmental constraint that there is on that plateau,” Mello said. “The laboratory is too big and trying to do too much in a place that was never appropriate for a laboratory of the present scale, let alone the additional laboratory facilities and staff that they envision.”
The approximately 18,000 people employed at LANL work mostly in science and engineering, from modeling infectious diseases to increasing the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.
“Our missions are vital and critical to national security and they cannot fail,” Davis said.

The here and now
The Jemez wilderness bears scars from the Cerro Grande and Las Conchas fires. Large bald patches with skinny charred remains of the ponderosa pines stand among scrub oak brush replacing the once-forested area.
Recent scattered rainstorms offered a small reprieve, but the area remains in Stage 1 fire restrictions — an elevated threat level that restricts all campfires or outdoor burning.
Laboratory facilities are interspersed on the top of mesas to higher elevation ponderosa pine forests, separated by canyons and arroyos filled with brush. The lab is bordered by federally managed forests; San Ildefonso and Jemez Pueblos; and Santa Fe and Los Alamos County land.
The patchwork of agencies has complicated firefighting and mitigation efforts in the past, said Jeff Dare, who leads the Emergency Operations Center, but Cerro Pelado offered a framework for more cooperation with members of county government and liaisons for surrounding federal agencies and tribal governments.
The lab is part of the Master Cooperative Wildland Fire Response Agreement, which allocates additional resources such as helicopters and personnel to fight any wildfire that does appear, Dare said, adding: “It protects the laboratory before it can get here.”
 ‘Hope is not a strategy’
The more recent focus has been trimming back the areas around lab buildings, roads and utility lines, said Richard Nieto, LANL’s wildland fire program manager. Trimming has occurred on an estimated 12% to 15% of lab property.

“Hope is not a strategy,” Nieto said, adding that the area needs to better adapt to fires when they happen. “This area was meant to burn; it’s what we have to deal with, ecologically.”
But overgrowth is a challenge. Much of the higher-elevation ponderosa forests sport 400 to 1,300 trees per acre, rather than the healthier 50 to 150 trees per acre, he said. Habitats for two endangered species and archeological sites also require consideration.
Beyond trimming, the lab is working on developing plans for prescribed burns, but will take another three to five years to realize, he said.
Preparations on the plateau
On the other side of lab property, fences looped with concertina wire and sporting signs warning of radiological hazards contain Area G.
Vaguely merengue- shaped white tents — coated in fireproof material — stand amid the juniper and piñon scrub. Inside, under crisscrossed steel frames, stacked white containers on metal pallets contain legacy waste from the lab’s work in the nuclear program.
The facilities are geared to reducing fire concerns, said Gail Helm, the facility operations director for N3B, which is contracted to manage the 10-year $2 billion dollar cleanup of Cold War Era legacy waste. The tents include fire detection and suppression. Concrete barricades surround them to prevent vehicle accidents and potential fires. Under the Stage 1 fire restrictions, a water truck remains onsite at all times.
To the west of Area G lies Technical Area 53, where the lab logs and stores new transuranic nuclear waste — such as gloves contaminated with plutonium — produced at the new plutonium pit production site. The waste is eventually disposed off-site at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project outside of Carlsbad.
Thomas Vigil, the deputy group leader at the Chemical and Waste Facilities said LANL is doing “its due diligence” to follow every protocol to keep the public and workers safe.
“This is my state, this is where we live,” he said. “I live just down the road, and it’s important to me.”

,DC,2025-05-30 22:00:21+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"PBS, Minnesota public TV station sue Trump over executive order cutting off funds",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pbs-minnesota-public-tv-station-sue-trump-over-executive-order-cutting-funds,,"WASHINGTON — The Public Broadcasting Service and Lakeland PBS in Minnesota sued the Trump administration Friday, arguing an executive order seeking to cut off their federal funding violates the Constitution and would “upend public television.”The lawsuit was filed just days after a collection of National Public Radio stations sued President Donald Trump over the same executive order, which blocked the Corporation from Public Broadcasting from funding the networks.PBS wrote in its 48-page filing that it disagrees with claims made by the executive order, including that federal spending on public media is “corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence” and that the news organization doesn’t present “a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”“PBS disputes those charged assertions in the strongest possible terms,” the lawsuit states. “But regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS’s programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.”The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, but hadn’t been assigned to a judge as of Friday evening.White House: PBS supports ‘a particular political party’White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields wrote in a statement responding to the lawsuit that the “Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers’ dime.“Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS. The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.”The lawsuit says Trump’s executive order violates the law that governs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which gives it independence from politicians who might try to control its programs.“Congress took pains to ensure that the development of public television would be free from political interference, including with respect to content and funding decisions,” the suit states.It also claims implementing the order would violate the First Amendment of the Constitution.“The EO makes no attempt to hide the fact that it is cutting off the flow of funds to PBS because of the content of PBS programming and out of a desire to alter the content of speech,” the lawsuit states. “That is blatant viewpoint discrimination and an infringement of PBS and PBS Member Stations’ private editorial discretion.”PBS says federal funds ‘instrumental’ for operationsThe lawsuit says the loss of funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting envisioned in the executive order would upend programming at PBS and its member stations throughout the country.“Public television stations receive approximately $325 million in annual federal funding from CPB, nearly all of which goes to PBS Member Stations,"" the lawsuit states. ""Those funds, which comprise more than 50% of the overall budgets of certain PBS Member Stations, are instrumental to enabling them to operate, to produce programming that serves their local communities, and to pay PBS dues that make PBS programming and services possible.”",,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids filed a motion to intervene in the case […],"Efforts to collect signatures for two proposed ballot measures for the 2026 election will begin this fall, following the attorney general's approval of ballot language Thursday. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and the state attorney general argued in federal court filings this week that two ballot question committees are not entitled to intervene in the League’s lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of direct democracy laws.
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids filed a motion to intervene in the case on May 14, arguing that their interests aren’t “adequately represented” because the League’s suit didn’t challenge all the laws they intended to. The committees also argued that intervening is more efficient than filing a separate lawsuit, which they said would likely be consolidated with the League’s complaint under federal court rules. 
Arkansas grassroots organizations seek to intervene in lawsuit challenging direct democracy laws 

In its response to the motion, which was filed by Little Rock attorney David Couch on Wednesday, the League of Women Voters of Arkansas and ballot question committee Save AR Democracy (SARD) argue the two ballot question committees don’t have standing and have no right to intervene because they are not questioning LWVAR’s ability to challenge the laws in the original complaint. 
LWVAR filed a federal lawsuit against the Arkansas secretary of state in April alleging that eight recently approved state laws governing direct democracy violate the First and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. 
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The motion to intervene from Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids seeks to challenge two laws not included in the League of Women Voters’ suit — Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level, and Act 236 of 2023, which mandates petition signatures must be collected from at least 50 counties instead of 15 as directed in the Arkansas Constitution, according to court filings. 
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids also seek to add an additional defendant, Attorney General Tim Griffin, who is not a party to the pending litigation but is counsel for the secretary of state, which would further complicate the matter, according to LWVAR’s response. 
Grade-level requirement
In the defendant’s response, also filed Wednesday, Griffin noted that when he certified For AR Kids’ popular name and ballot title for a proposed education-related constitutional amendment on Feb. 26, the ballot title didn’t need to meet the reading-level requirement because Act 602 was not yet in effect.
The League and Save AR Democracy made the same point in their filing to argue that For AR Kids lacks standing to challenge the reading-level law. 
Protect AR Rights submitted its own proposed direct-democracy ballot title on May 19 that’s still under review by the attorney general. LWVAR argues this group also does not have standing because its proposed ballot title has not been rejected because of Act 602. 
LWVAR argues that challenging Act 602 is further complicated because Griffin substituted and certified Save AR Democracy’s ballot title on May 21 so that it would meet the eighth-grade reading level test. 
“Even if Protect AR Rights had standing, the inclusion of that issue in the litigation would unnecessarily complicate this matter,” the response states. “Nothing would prohibit Protect AR Rights from instituting litigation if it is denied a ballot title to meet the eighth grade reading level test.”
Griffin argues that the motion to intervene should be denied because Protect AR Rights is the only party that can challenge Act 602. This is also the only claim that can be made against the attorney general, he said. 
State law requires the attorney general to certify or reject proposed ballot titles within 10 business days. The deadline for a response to Protect AR Rights’ proposal is June 3. Because it is still under review, allowing the ballot question committee to intervene “would require finding an injury in fact where such harm is hypothetical and not concrete,” Griffin wrote. 
“Because Plaintiff SARD was able to satisfy the Act 602 requirement, the court has to resort to speculation to determine that Protect AR Rights’ ballot title could never be at an eighth-grade reading level,” he said. “For the same reasons, Protect AR Rights cannot bring a cause of action against Attorney General Griffin.”
County signatures
Regarding the proposed intervenors’ challenge to the 2023 law requiring signatures from 50 counties, LWVAR’s response notes that this law is already being challenged by the League in Pulaski County Circuit Court. The case has been fully argued, briefed and is awaiting the court’s ruling. 
Plaintiffs argue there is no need for the claim to be pursued at this time and if it were allowed, it should be held in abeyance under the Pullman Doctrine, which provides that federal courts defer to state courts if the state ruling would resolve the federal issue. 
“The issue before the Circuit Court is simply, can the Arkansas General Assembly amend the Arkansas State Constitution by statute? The League believes that it cannot, and a ruling in its favor would resolve the federal issue,” according to court documents.
Griffin also cited the Pullman Doctrine and noted that the losing party in the case is expected to appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
“Thus, the [federal] Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this claim, which is only being made by Movants to intervene,” he wrote. “Standing alone, this claim cannot be a basis for Movants to be entitled to intervention.” 
Additional concerns
LWVAR further argues that Protect AR Rights’ proposed ballot measure “would conflict with and be in direct competition with” Save AR Democracy’s approved measure because both seek to amend Article 5, Section 1 of the state Constitution, which governs the state’s initiative and referendum process. 
“It would be improper for the Protect AR Rights to intervene in litigation filed by SARD to get a measure approved that directly competes with the measure already approved and being circulated by SARD, in that it would create unnecessary conflict,” according to LWVAR’s response. 
Save AR Democracy also argues Protect AR Rights’ proposed ballot measure contradicts with a claim made in the complaint — that the “exhaustive list of disqualifying offenses” that prohibits individuals from collecting signatures is unconstitutional. 
“The measure submitted by Protect AR Rights to the Attorney General for approval would enshrine this very prohibition in the Arkansas constitution,” the response says. “This represents a core political and policy difference between SARD and Protect AR Rights and would inject unnecessary controversy and conflict into the litigation.”
Protect AR Rights’ proposal also sets forth a procedure regarding a legal challenge to the ballot title that “differs substantially” from Save AR Democracy’s procedure. 
Save AR Democracy’s measure would require an approved ballot title to be submitted to the secretary of state who publishes notice of approval and the procedure for challenging the approval. The measure would establish a 45-day window during which a challenge could be filed with the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
The Protect AR Rights measure would require a challenge to be filed within 10 business days of the attorney general sending the sponsor a letter approving the ballot title, but it provides for no notice. Providing the public “adequate notice and opportunity” is essential to due process, the response states.

According to Alyssa Chen, a coordinator with Education Justice, schools in Montpelier and Brattleboro also held protests.READ MORE
At Champlain Valley Union High School, the May 21 protest was particularly resonant. Last month, two of the students’ peers chose to leave the country in response to the federal government’s attempt to revoke the humanitarian protections granting them legal residence. The teens were originally from Nicaragua, a country that has been experiencing state-led violence and repression since 2018. They had been sponsored by a local family member and looked forward to furthering their education in the United States. Faced with potential deportation and an uncertain future, they chose to leave instead.While, as with the two high school students, the impact of some of the changes in the Trump administration’s immigration policies have been acute in the district, the student protest rejected a broad swath of the federal government’s actions, including the administration’s challenge to birthright citizenship.“We can’t control every decision made by those in power, but we can control how we show up for each other, and when we lead with empathy, when we choose compassion over fear, that’s when real change begins,” Lily Williams, one of the senior class co-presidents said to the students gathered.Armed with signs bearing slogans such as “Borders shouldn’t define humanity,” and “Education not deportation,” the students marched down the sidewalk beside the school.Champlain Valley Union High School students walked out of class last week to protest federal immigraiont policy. Photo by Briana Brady/Shelburne NewsThe school administration was on board with the student action. One of their librarians provided a speaker system and microphone. Other teachers and staff, decked out in reflective vests, helped guide the teens safely through the parking lot. Their principal, Katherine Riley, stood nearby.For Olivia Ceiri, a sophomore and member of the school’s Racial Alliance Committee, this action was just one of many she encouraged students to take, suggesting that they build a habit of standing up for what they believed.“If we are willing to commit our time, love and well-being to the betterment of others, we will not be denied. We pledge to each other our responsibility to act and agree to stand by our values no matter the cost,” Ceiri said.The Education Justice Coalition of Vermont, which helped organize students across the state wanted to support the students to plan the walkouts themselves.“I’ve been working with like, half a dozen youth leaders, and several dozen other youth who have been attending weekly meetings on and off to plan the walkout so that it’s coordinated and supported. And so, mainly, we created a toolkit,” Chen said.In this way, the coalition wasn’t just leading the students in protest. As Ceiri wanted, they were teaching the kids how to lead each other in protest.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Champlain Valley Union students protest immigration policies.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cvu-protest-1.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting “988” or chatting online at http://988lifeline.org/.
A 64-year-old man from Cuba started strangling himself and saying he was going to kill himself after federal agents arrested him at the Miami immigration court on Friday morning.
Jesus Rodriguez Delgado, 64, started yelling in Spanish that he would kill himself rather than be sent back to Cuba, said Karla De Anda, a community advocate who called for help as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents struggled to remove Rodriguez Delgado’s handcuffed hands from his neck.
“It was the most horrible thing I’ve seen in my life,” De Anda said in Spanish. “Hopefully, they’ll help him because he can’t go back to Cuba.”
The man’s reaction wasn’t surprising to his partner, Elisavel Torres, who told Florida Phoenix from inside the courthouse that Rodriguez Delgado had been a political prisoner in Cuba for 28 years and had lived in Mexico for six years before coming to the U.S. De Anda added that Rodriguez Delgado had said he had been imprisoned and would be killed if deported to Cuba.
Torres wept as she said that she couldn’t understand why the judge agreed to dismiss Rodriguez Delgado’s deportation case — exposing him to expedited removal. An application for permanent residency that Rodriguez Delgado submitted in January states he entered the country under humanitarian parole in 2021. Torres said Rodriguez Delgado received a work permit in April.
“He had told me he wouldn’t go back to Cuba, that he would die first, and it will be that way,” Torres told the Phoenix in Spanish.
ICE and Homeland Security Investigations officials arrested at least seven people during the four hours that the Phoenix reporter observed activity inside the courthouse.
Reports emerged last week of arrests in immigration courts across the country after judges dismissed cases at the request of the Department of Homeland Security. Still, Rodriguez Delgado’s attempt to strangle himself was the strongest reaction advocates witnessed on Friday. Others arrested cried and some remained quiet and looked at the ground.
‘You show up and get deported anyway’: Migrants with court hearings face an impossible choice

The agents told Torres that they would make sure Rodriguez Delgado was OK and would give him a list of pro bono attorneys, but couldn’t at the time of his arrest say where he would go. Torres, a U.S. citizen, said the couple knew about the arrests but still decided to come to the hearing from Naples rather than requesting an online hearing.
“We had faith in God that we were doing everything right, so we said we would come in person,” Torres said. “What a huge mistake.”
Her tears intensified as she told Rodriguez Delgado’s daughter about her father’s arrest over the phone.
“I was born in this country, and I am ashamed to say I’m American,” Torres said, adding that there were no words to describe how she felt when federal agents placed her partner in handcuffs.
Immigrants lack legal representation
Immigration attorney Cindy Blandon told the Phoenix that she’s noticed those who end up arrested for expedited removal lack lawyers. Few people in the court on Friday morning had attorneys, with some citing money as a barrier to obtaining legal representation.
Having an ongoing asylum or permanent residency case doesn’t exempt people from expedited deportations, Blandon said.
“Being placed under an expedited removal process doesn’t mean your case is closed,” she said. “People have a right to due process. The problem is that if you don’t have legal representation and you don’t know how to navigate the situation, you will likely end up deported.”
The mood on various floors of the courthouse grew more tense as people awaiting hearings heard about or saw the arrests.
But Blandon, De Anda, and Maria Asuncion Bilbao, with the American Friends Service Committee, noted that the arrests in the court appeared much calmer compared to the mass raids, such as the one that took place in Tallahassee on Thursday.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Potentially dangerous and possibly record-breaking warm weather is headed to western Montana this weekend.
On Thursday, the National Weather Service Office in Missoula issued a heat advisory from noon to 9 p.m. on Saturday. Temperatures in the upper 80s and 90s are expected for a wide swath of western Montana stretching from the Canadian border down through the Flathead, Missoula and Bitterroot valleys.
NWS Meteorologist Jennifer Kitzmiller, based in Missoula, said seeing temperatures in the 90s this early in the year was atypical. Anaconda, Eureka, Libby and Phillipsburg are some of the places that could approach their daily high record mark, if not break it.
“We’re looking at setting records for daily high temperatures tomorrow and a lot of places in western Montana,” Kitzmiller said. “And previous records date back to 1986 … we haven’t seen temperatures this warm, this time of year, for like 40 years.”
The heat is being driven by a strong ridge of high pressure in the West, according to a NWS national report. Temperatures are expected to dip back down on Sunday.
“It’s not going to be hugely different, but it’ll cool us back down,” Kitzmiller said.
The weather service also issued some recommendations, including drinking plenty of water and staying out of direct sunlight. 
Warm weather also draws people to bodies of water, especially on a weekend, which can add a degree of danger. May 24 was particularly deadly as a woman drowned near Missoula near Maclay Bridge and a kayaker died near Craig. Additionally, a 68-year old Missoula man last seen on Wednesday is presumed to have drowned near the Lochsa River in Idaho.
Lifevests should always be worn when on or in the water, and a close eye should be kept on children. Additionally, alcohol can enhance hypothermia, and cold water can make even experienced swimmers lose muscle control.
“The rivers and streams are still running fast and cold,” Kitzmiller said. “And there’s that extra threat, despite the warm temperatures, for hypothermia.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BigHoleRiver-Stock-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well. 


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
Gov. Kim Reynolds calls Iowa ‘a pro-family state’
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Iowa law gives four weeks of paid leave
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

State regulators have reinstated the license of an Iowa insurance agent who was convicted of falsifying records that resulted in increased commissions.
State records indicate that in February 2024, Country Mutual Insurance notified the Iowa Insurance Division that it had fired one of its agents, Pablo Castillo of Norwalk, for allegedly submitting forged documents that he had created to establish clients’ eligibility for coverage and to provide them with discounts on home insurance.
It was alleged that in order to sell an auto insurance policy to three separate consumers, Castillo fabricated letters from another insurance company to falsely suggest each of the consumers had no prior gaps in their insurance coverage. In a fourth case, Castillo allegedly fabricated a letter from State Farm Insurance to explain a consumer’s involvement in two accidents.

Castillo was also accused of fabricating roofing invoices from fictitious businesses for at least four clients as a way of enhancing the value of any subsequent claims related to roof repairs.
In October 2024, the Iowa Insurance Division charged Castillo, 38, with engaging unfair, deceptive and dishonest conduct. Division records indicate that at a hearing on the matter, Castillo admitted falsifying the records, explaining that he did so to ensure his clients would be covered.
Iowa Insurance Commissioner Douglas Ommen subsequently suspended Castillo’s license for 30 days, stating that he found Castillo to be “a sincere, well-intentioned individual with generally good moral character.”
In November 2024, Polk County prosecutors charged Castillo with fraudulent sales practices and felony insurance fraud for falsifying records so he would “earn commissions on his sales that would otherwise be denied by the company.”
In April 2025, Castillo pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of misdemeanor tampering with records. He was sentenced to two years of probation, fined $855 fine, and granted a deferred judgment that will seal any court records related to the conviction upon the successful completion of probation.
Earlier this month, the Iowa Insurance Division ordered that Castillo’s license be reinstated. Pursuant to the 2024 suspension order, Castillo will be required to file with the division a periodic “summary of his work in the business of insurance.”

,DC,2025-05-30 21:30:25+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump ‘blatant’ refusal to comply in deportation case shows growing rift with judges,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-blatant-refusal-comply-deportation-case-shows-growing-rift-judges,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Maryland slammed the Trump administration Friday for its “blatant lack of effort to comply” with her order earlier this month to report steps taken to facilitate the return of a second wrongly deported man to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.“Defendants’ untimely response is the functional equivalent of, ‘We haven’t done anything and don’t intend to,’” U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, whom President Donald Trump appointed in 2018, wrote in her order blasting a nonresponse from the Department of Homeland Security.“Telling this Court that ‘[i]t is DHS’s understanding that Cristian is in the custody of El Salvador,’ adds nothing to the underlying record and simply reflects a lack of any effort to obtain or provide information regarding Cristian’s ‘current physical location and custodial status,’” she wrote.Friday’s order from Gallagher is the latest scathing remark from federal judges who have found the Trump administration either violated their preliminary injunctions or restraining orders, or have broadly invoked executive privileges to stonewall information in immigration cases.Gallagher, like other federal judges who have found themselves in the spotlight for blocking immigration-related policies, raised concerns about the Trump administration skirting due process rights and slow-walking rectifying deportation mistakes as the government continues its aggressive campaign of mass deportations.Officials at the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and President Donald Trump himself have continued to claim broad authority to conduct immigration removals. They have lashed out against the judges, labeling them as “activists” and accusing them of blocking the Trump administration’s agenda.“Its very important that we're able to get these people out fast,” Trump said during a press availability in the Oval Office Friday. “We have judges that don't want that to happen. It's a terrible thing.” Violating removal protectionsTwo cases of men whom the administration sent to El Salvador despite court orders blocking their removals stemmed from the first major case of the administration apparently disregarding a judicial order: a temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg not to remove migrants under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.Despite the mid-March temporary restraining order from Boasberg, three planes landed in El Salvador hours later and roughly 300 men were sent to the Salvadoran mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT. Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and a 20-year-old referred to in court documents only by the pseudonym Cristian, whose case Gallagher is handling, were among them.Abrego Garcia had, since 2019, a court order protecting him from deportation to his home country of El Salvador because an immigration judge was concerned he would face gang violence if returned.Cristian, who arrived in the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor, was part of a class action that barred removal from the U.S. while his asylum case was pending in immigration court.In both cases, the administration has said it is powerless to compel the Salvadoran government to release them, an argument Gallagher expressed frustration with Friday.“Defendants simply reiterated their well-worn talking points on their reasons for removing Cristian and failed to provide any of the information the Court required,” Gallagher wrote.The U.S. is paying El Salvador up to $15 million to detain removed immigrants.“As a Venezuelan native, he is in El Salvador only because the United States sent him there pursuant to an agreement apparently reached with the government of El Salvador,” Gallagher wrote.Judges see pattern of defianceIn Abrego Garcia’s high-profile case, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, also in Maryland, said “nothing has been done” by the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. Administration officials have admitted he was mistakenly deported to CECOT.Xinis recently denied the Department of Justice’s request for an extra 30 days to submit documents on its efforts to return Abrego Garcia.He remains in a lower-level prison in El Salvador, despite a Supreme Court order from April that directed the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.A judge in Massachusetts found the Trump administration violated his preliminary injunction barring third-country removals of migrants without due process after eight men were deported to South Sudan and given less than 24 hours to challenge their removal to a county on the cusp of another civil war.Boasberg, who sits in a federal court in the District of Columbia, found probable cause to hold Trump officials in contempt for violating his temporary restraining order that ordered deportation planes carrying men removed under the Alien Enemies Act to be returned to the U.S. over concerns they did not receive due process.The Trump administration has challenged all those decisions on an emergency basis to the U.S. Supreme Court.‘A judge in Boston running foreign policy’Top administration figures have argued it is the judges who have overstepped, trespassing on the executive branch’s role in setting foreign policy.In the Oval Office Friday, Trump singled out U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy, who is overseeing the case in Massachusetts.“You can’t have a judge in Boston running foreign policy in places all over the country because he has a liberal bent or he’s a radical left person,” Trump said.Murphy was appointed by former President Joe Biden.That case, which centers on removing migrants to a country they are not citizens of, could play an outsized role in the legal battle over the administration’s approach to immigration after Supreme Court decisions this month have allowed the Trump administration to end two temporary legal programs and exposed more than 800,000 immigrants to potential deportation.Many of those who lost protections hail from countries that are deemed too dangerous for return.‘Get them out rapidly’The Trump administration has publicly stated Abrego Garcia will not return and accused him, without producing evidence, that he is a leader of the MS-13 gang.The president has also acknowledged that if he wanted to, he could secure the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador. But Trump said he would not, alleging that Abrego Garcia has gang ties.The president posted pictures on social media of Boasberg, who was pressing Department of Justice attorneys for answers on if his order was deliberately violated. It prompted a rare response from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who stressed the importance of an independent judiciary.While the Supreme Court eventually lifted Boasberg's nationwide injunction on the use of the Alien Enemies Act, federal judges in Colorado and parts of New York and Texas have blocked use of the wartime law within their districts, citing concerns about due process.Top Trump officials, such as Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, have floated suspending habeas corpus, which allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court.Habeas corpus claims are currently the only avenue that Venezuelans subject to the Alien Enemies Act have to challenge their deportation under the wartime law.“We can't keep them for years here as they go through trial,” Trump said Friday of swift deportations. “We have to get them out rapidly.” Abrego Garcia and CristianIn an April order, Gallagher wrote that Cristian’s case is similar to Abrego Garcia’s and that “like Judge Xinis in the Abrego Garcia matter, this court will order Defendants to facilitate Cristian's return to the United States so that he can receive the process he was entitled to under the parties' binding Settlement Agreement.”In that order, Gallagher said the federal government must show “a good faith request to the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services).”On May 6, she affirmed her decision that the Trump administration must facilitate Cristian’s return, but put her own order on pause to allow for Department of Justice attorneys to appeal to the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.The appeals court declined the Trump administration's request to pause her order.Gallagher said Friday she would give the Trump administration officials until Monday to “remedy their noncompliance.”",,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

(John Coletti/The Image Bank)The U.S. Department of Energy announced Friday the cancellation of 24 awards issued by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations that impacts
two businesses in Alabama.
American Cast Iron Pipe Company and United States Pipe and Foundry Company, LLC were both set to receive $75 million in grant money from the Department of Energy but will no longer receive the funding in light of the grants getting canceled. 
“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a DOE press release. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”
A message was left with both companies Friday seeking comment.
According to a press release, American Cast Iron Pipe Company made it to the negotiation stage of the awards process and was planning to use the funding to replace single cupola furnaces with four coreless induction furnaces. This would have reduced the facility’s CO2 emissions by an estimated 62% and the melting/holding process CO2 emissions by 95%. 
The U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company said in a press release that they planned to use the money for Phase 1 of U.S. Pipe’s Iron Electric Induction Conversion project. The project involved replacing a coke-fired furnace with electric induction melting furnaces and would have resulted in an “estimated 73% reduction in carbon intensity at the Alabama Works ductile iron pipe production facility.”
Of the 24 awards given, nearly 70% were signed between Election Day last year and Jan. 20. By cancelling the awards, the Department of Energy is generating $3.6 billion in savings for Americans. 
The DOE said the awards have been terminated because they “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Birmingham-Alabama-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

The passage of Legislative Bill 647 was delayed because State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha wanted to remove State Sen. Tony Sorrentino’s proposal due to what she called a broken “agreement” regarding State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, which would have helped schools fund long-term substitutes so teachers could take paid time off around significant life events.  
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area said there was no “agreement” with the Legislature’s Revenue Committee. 
“There was no deal,” he said. “I was invited into a conversation to talk about the bills that were at play, including Senator [​Ashlei Spivey]’s bill. I told the participants in that meeting clearly that I will not make a deal. Each bill needs to stand on its own.”
The “deal” involved a bipartisan group on the Education Committee and the state’s largest teachers’ union — which led to a month-long effort to get a package of proposals out of committee. That package is dead, replaced by a watered-down clean-up bill. 
LB 647 advanced 35-13. That tally included the support of two Democrats, State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln and Dan Quick of Grand Island. Bostar said that he voted against including Sorrentino’s proposal during the last round of debate but decided to vote for LB 647 as a whole because it was needed to balance the budget. State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island said his constituents have asked to be in favor of Sorrenino’s proposal. 
At least 42 states already allow such savings accounts to cover tuition at K-12 private schools, which was first allowed federally in 2018 after congressional passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for up to $10,000 per beneficiary per year. A 529 savings plan — in Nebraska, NEST 529 — offers tax breaks to encourage families or students to donate and allows the savings to grow tax-free and be used for an approved educational purpose. 
Nebraska voters in November repealed the state’s new school voucher or scholarship program that was set to steer public dollars to private schools, though conservative lawmakers and Gov. Jim Pillen have pledged to keep trying to pass a replacement.  Public school advocates have argued against using public funds for that purpose and said voucher programs in other states have bled public money needed for public education.

SPRINGFIELD — Terminally ill Illinoisans may have the legal option to end their own life with the help of a physician next year under a bill approved by lawmakers Thursday.

The procedure, which advocates and the bill call “medical aid in dying,” would give people in a sound mental state with severe health issues the option to end their life with the help of a doctor.

Under Senate Bill 1950, doctors would be allowed to prescribe terminally ill patients a lethal dose of medication that they could self-administer at a time of their choice.

Advocates for the procedure, which is legal in 10 states and the District of Columbia, say it provides agency to people at the end of their life.

“I want to enjoy the time I have left with my family and friends,” Deb Robertson, a terminally ill woman, told lawmakers via Zoom on Wednesday. “I don’t want to worry about how my death will happen. It’s really the only bit of control left for me.”

The measure passed in the House 63-42 after more than an hour of intense, sometimes tear-filled debate. It now awaits action in the Senate. Senators have a matter of hours to pass the bill before their scheduled adjournment Saturday.





The bill outlines a process that includes two doctors recommending the procedure, sometimes referred to as medically assisted suicide, and limits the people who are eligible. People must be of sound mind and have a prognosis of less than six months.

Death certificates of those who use the procedure would also list their underlying diseases, not “suicide,” reflecting the common belief among advocates that the procedure should not be called suicide. Bill sponsor Rep. Robyn Gabel, D-Evanston, noted in debate Thursday that the provision would also “prevent inappropriate suicide investigations.”

But even with these protections, some oppose allowing the procedure.

Medical associations are divided on the issue. The American Medical Association, the largest and most influential medical association, notes an “irreducible moral tension” inherent in the practice.

The AMA’s Code of Ethics, for many years, said the procedure is “fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as healer.” The association has recently softened its stance, opening the door for physicians to act on their own conscience on the matter.

Rep. Bill Hauter, R-Morton, a practicing physician, opposed the bill and told his colleagues during debate Thursday that it “changes forever the soul of medicine.”

During the House debate, the division among the health care industry reared its head. Rep. Nicolle Grasse, D-Arlington Heights, is a hospice chaplain and was supportive of the bill.

“I've seen hospice ease pain and suffering and offer dignity and quality of life as people are dying, but I've also seen the rare moments when even the best care cannot relieve suffering and pain, when patients ask us with clarity and peace for the ability to choose how their life ends,” she said.

Outside of health care, religious groups and disability rights advocates are also divided. Members of both parties invoked their faith during floor debate, including Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford, an ordained Christian minister.

“Life is sacred. Death is sacred, too,” West said. “The sanctity of life includes the sanctity of death. This bill allows, if one chooses by themselves, for someone with a terminal diagnosis to have a dignified death.""

Republicans, who are generally more aligned with pro-life religious groups, opposed the bill. Catholic groups say procedures like medically assisted suicide violate the church’s teachings and many conservative protestant groups oppose the practice as well.

Rep. Adam Niemerg, R-Dietrich, said the procedure does not “uphold the dignity of every human life.”

“This does not respect the Gospel,” Niemerg, who is Catholic, said during debate. “This does not respect the teachings of Jesus Christ or uphold the values of God.”

Disability rights activists are also split on the issue. Sebastian Nalls, a policy analyst at the disability rights organization Access Living, said that if the procedure is legalized, insurers may pressure some sick people into it instead of expensive treatment.

“This bill carries far too many loopholes and lacks oversight to be safe and equitable, but the bottom line for Access Living is this: The existence of assisted suicide is a threat, to not just the kind of health care we deserve, but a threat to our ability to live and die with dignity,” Nalls said in a committee hearing Wednesday.

Other disability rights advocates, like Beth Langen, note that ""disability is not terminal.”

“Death, like life, is easier to navigate when you know you will have options to choose from, even if you never need to,” Langen said at Wednesay’s hearing.

Recent increases in success rates at hunting exceedingly difficult-to-kill wolves are “really good,” a Wyoming biologist said, because it shows that fair-chase tactics are still working. 
The post What’s it take to kill a Wyoming wolf? Nearly 500 hunting days, and then it’s likely a youngster appeared first on WyoFile .","Last fall, hunters put in their time pursuing Wyoming deer. They spent 12 days afield, on average, per kill. About 60% were successful.  
Elk hunters had a slightly tougher go of it. Statewide, they drove, hiked and glassed an average of 19 days to successfully harvest a wapiti. Nearly 53% punched their tag.
It’s no secret that large carnivores, which occur at lower densities, are notoriously more difficult to locate, close in on and kill. Even aided by stinky bait — a common, legal tactic — Wyoming black bear hunters spent 66 days in the field per animal downed in 2023, the last year of available data. Success rates were starkly lower: Just 14%. 
Then there’s the wolf. 
Intelligent, relatively sparse in population, and often aided by many sets of packmate eyeballs to spot threats, wolves have proven exceptionally difficult to kill in parts of Wyoming where hunters are restricted to fair-chase tactics.
This graph shows hunter success rates and effort since Wyoming gained jurisdiction over its wolves in 2012. From 2014-2016, no hunt occurred because the state’s population was relisted under the Endangered Species Act. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)

Wyoming Game and Fish Department biologist Ken Mills shared the data at a hunting season-setting meeting in Pinedale this week. During the 2023 season, the last year data was available, hunters in Wyoming’s trophy game area, where wolves are regulated, logged about 450 days per animal they managed to kill. Success rates registered at 2.7%. (Mills is still sussing out the numbers from the 2024 wolf hunt, though he expects an uptick in success.)
At least in Wyoming, those numbers are pretty typical, according to a graph the state agency’s longtime wolf biologist presented to four members of the public and a handful of colleagues. There was a time, he said, when wolves were smartening up to hunting pressure so well it was even a concern — hunter-days logged per wolf climbed from 300 to more than 500 between 2017 and 2021.

“If it continues to increase, there’s a lower probability that we’ll be able to use fair-chase hunting as a management tool,” Mills said. “If wolves are learning so much, and avoiding hunting so well, we’re going to have [a] low harvest and we’re not going to be able to attain our [target population] objectives.” 
For that reason, he said, improvements in success and days spent hunting per kill from 2022 to 2024 were “actually really good” to see.
“OK, fair-chase hunting is working,” Mills explained of his thinking. “It’s still a good tool to be able to manage wolf numbers, which is certainly my preference.” 
In Montana and Idaho, the only other Lower 48 states that currently hunt wolves, wildlife managers tasked by their state legislatures with killing more wolves have shifted gears, adopting tactics like trapping, snaring and night-hunting with thermal imagery that have remained prohibited in Wyoming’s wolf trophy game area. (In Wyoming’s predator zone, encompassing 85% of the state, virtually anything goes, even running over wolves with snowmobiles.)

It’s unclear based on easily accessible data how hunter success in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming’s wolf predator zone compares to the numbers Mills presented from the tightly regulated trophy game area. During the 2023-’24 wolf season in Montana, roughly 1.6% of hunting and trapping license holders killed a wolf, but the harvest report doesn’t track hunter effort. Idaho, likewise, doesn’t provide hunting effort data in its wolf harvest report, though at one point in the past, license-holder success was as low as 0.4% in the Gem State. 
In Wyoming, the wealth of data also provides some insight into the types of animals the lucky few successful hunters are ultimately pulling the trigger on. Especially early in the season, the preponderance of animals killed are young: either that year’s pups, yearlings or 2-year-olds. 
“About a third of the wolves taken in September were juveniles, and that declines through time,” Mills said. 
The majority of wolves killed in Wyoming’s hunt are either pups, yearlings or 2 year olds, especially early in the season. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
Back in 2018, Game and Fish tacked on September to its wolf hunt. Shortly afterward, Mills recollected, officials bumped the start date back a couple of weeks to avoid killing pups on “rendezvous sites” — where the young of the year get stashed after leaving the den. 
The first six or so weeks of the Wyoming hunt — Sept. 15 through October — remain the easiest time of year to kill a wolf, the data shows. That’s because success increases when hunting localized wolves, like the youngsters tied to a rendezvous site. 
“Especially year to year, people figure out where wolves are hanging out,” Mills said. “They know where to go.” 
Wyoming’s 2025 wolf hunting season proposal would bring mostly modest changes from the 2024 season. The maximum number of wolves that could be killed would increase from 38 to 44 animals, though that must pass muster with the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission.
Stability in Wyoming’s wolf population and regulated wolf hunt have become the norm.

Joni Ernst held a town hall at Aplington-Parkersburg High School in Parkersburg May 30, 2025. (Screenshot via C-SPAN)PARKERSBURG, IOWA — At a sometimes raucous town hall meeting Friday morning, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst faced vocal opposition to her support for spending cuts to programs such as Medicaid and SNAP.
Like many other Republican lawmakers holding events with constituents throughout the country, Ernst faced a crowd at the Aplington-Parkersburg High School who were upset with decisions made by President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress — particularly as they relate to funding for health care and food assistance programs included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House earlier in May.
Though Ernst said the Senate would make changes to the measure and advance their own version of the legislation, she defended reductions in spending for Medicaid at the town hall, saying the changes will not impact people in need but will remove from the program “illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits” and able-bodied adults who are not working.
“People will die,” a woman shouted at the stage as Ernst answered one of several questions about the cuts.
“People are not — well, we all are going to die, so for heaven’s sake,” Ernst said in a response that was met by further shouts and jeering from the crowd.
Ernst said she agrees with most of the provisions on Medicaid included in the House version of the budget reconciliation bill, saying that it was targeted at changes to the public health care program that “made it much easier to get onto Medicaid, but much tougher to take people off of Medicaid.” Ernst said many people on Medicaid currently are working full-time and have access to other benefits.
“What we have to do is make sure that those that are not eligible by the federal standard for Medicaid are not receiving Medicaid,” Ernst said. “What we do need to do is make sure that those that are part of a vulnerable population have access to Medicaid and receive those full benefits. So what we’re trying to do is strengthen Medicaid by directing the dollars to the people that actually meet the requirements of the program.”
In its House form, the bill includes a $625 billion reduction in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. It also includes 80-hour-per-month work requirements for people between ages 19 and 65 to continue receiving Medicaid health coverage, with several exceptions for people with disabilities and complex medical conditions, pregnant people, tribal community members and parents of dependent children.
Elizabeth Kehret, who works for Lutheran Services in Iowa, said she was troubled by the potential impact of Medicaid cuts for pregnant woman, saying that she was previously enrolled on Medicaid during her four pregnancies before the state revised eligibility for postpartum coverage, changing it from families with incomes of 375% of the federal poverty line to those at 215% of the federal poverty line.
Kehret said she was concerned the federal Medicaid spending cuts would cause similar cuts for care in states across the country, meaning pregnant people, who may also have private health coverage, will struggle to pay for the medical care required both before and after their child is born.
“I heard you say earlier about people who work full time but still get Medicaid — yeah,” Kehret said. “I meet with dozens of women who have dual enrollment, where they have private insurance as well as Medicaid, and it helps cover the things that their private insurance doesn’t, or that high deductible. … Medicaid is extremely important to the smallest and most vulnerable population in Iowa.”
Ernst said there were provisions to allow continued Medicaid coverage for pregnant people in the House bill.
“Because you are part of that vulnerable population, we want to make sure that you have access to Medicaid,” Ernst said. “So you will hear examples of those like the able-bodied, 30-year-old man who is taking advantage of the program, not working. What we’re asking is that please engage in work activities, engage in volunteer activities, be enrolled in a training program, and then that makes you Medicaid eligible.”
Similar concerns were brought up about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, that provides food assistance to low-income individuals. Under the House budget plan, some costs of SNAP would be moved to the states, in addition to adding other work requirements. Ernst said the House bill is correcting “overpayments” from states on SNAP, in addition to removing “people that have not been eligible for these programs by law as it is currently written” from public assistance.
Several veterans also spoke at the event, criticizing Republicans and Elon Musk’s DOGE Service for cuts to veterans’ assistance programs and cuts to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. In response, Ernst said, “We’re not cutting veterans benefits.”
Several veterans have been outspoken about changes made by DOGE to the VA, including the cut of roughly 2,400 VA jobs in early March.
Ernst has been a major supporter of DOGE and efforts to make government more “efficient,” saying Republicans and Musk are focused on removing areas of unnecessary spending and “streamlining” existing programs and services. Ernst highlighted the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as an entity that can be made more efficient through DOGE efforts in response to a question on federal support following natural disasters.
“Department of Government Efficiency … the E is not about elimination, it is about efficiency,” Ernst said. “So how can we do better as a federal government to respond to the people on the ground?”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A federal judge has ruled in favor of intervening environmental groups and dismissed a lawsuit against a decades-old rule that connects wetland protections to federal farm benefits. 
The lawsuit, filed by CTM Holdings LLC against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, alleged the law, commonly known as “swampbuster,” is unconstitutional. In March, federal representatives and intervening environmental groups argued in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa that CTM Holdings had no standing in the case. 
The lawsuit arose when CTM Holdings sought to farm a 9-acre portion of property that had previously been designated a wetland. The company, which rents the property to farmers, alleged in the complaint that the USDA “unconstitutionally” conditions its farm benefits through swampbuster. The company also argued the wetlands in question were dry but the federal agency would not remove the wetland designation.

Iowa Farmers Union, Iowa Environmental Council, Dakota Rural Action, and Food & Water Watch intervened in the case in support of the USDA with the goal of upholding the swampbuster rule, which they argued protects water quality, habitat and land. 
Iowa Environmental Council attorney Michael Schmidt said swampbuster serves as a “foundational conservation practice” to protect wetlands and habitat, prevent flooding and improve water quality. 
“This court’s thorough decision upholds the practical conservation measures that have been the standard for decades,” Schmidt said in a statement. “Commonsense measures like Swampbuster support Iowa farmers and everyone downstream from them.”
Judge says plaintiff ‘repeatedly’ lacks the standing to bring ‘any of its claims’
The intervenors argued, and Chief Justice C.J. Williams upheld that CTM Holdings had not suffered injury from swampbuster, nor had the company “exhausted its administrative remedies,” such as asking for a redetermination of the area. 
In March, during oral arguments on a motion, legal counsel from Pacific Legal Foundation and Liberty Justice Center, on behalf of CTM Holdings, said the company requested a redetermination of the land by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, or NRCS, but said the agency hardly ever changes a determination. 
The counsel representing the USDA said the agency’s records do not show a request for redetermination. 
Union of Concerned Scientists pushes for wetland protections in Farm Bill

Williams agreed with the USDA and the intervenors following a review of the communications and forms between the USDA and CTM Holdings. 
“If plaintiff’s intention was to request a review of the 2010 wetlands determination, nobody else in the world could possibly have known it,” Williams wrote in the ruling, adding that the company’s alleged injury was not “actual or imminent” but rather a “speculative chain of possibilities.” 
If the 9-acre area was indeed no longer wetland and the company actually requested a redetermination of the land, Williams wrote that CTM Holdings should have “no problems.” 
Arguments of unconstitutionality fail
The lawsuit argued swampbusters, formally known as the Wetland Conservation Compliance provisions of the 1985 Farm Bill, is unconstitutional for two reasons. 
First, it argued that government benefits cannot be conditioned. Per swampbuster, landowners must agree to avoid “any activity that alters natural wetlands” to remain eligible for USDA benefits like crop insurance and other subsidies farmers rely on. 
Williams wrote that the argument for unconstitutionality “misses the point” as it is framed in the suit. He explained that swampbuster is an “exercise” of Congress’ spending power, which may have conditions attached to it.

The complaint also alleged swampbuster is an unconstitutional “taking” of private land, and the requirement to avoid altering the property is akin to an unpaid easement. 
Williams rejected this argument as well, noting that CTM Holding does receive reimbursement for the wetland area in the form of USDA benefits. Additionally, he noted that property owners can still do “many things” to the designated wetland while complying with the law, including logging, which CTM Holdings did. 
Williams dismissed the case “with prejudice” meaning it cannot be refiled at a later date. 
Liberty Justice Center, one of the litigation firms representing CTM Holdings in the case, said the decision was “disappointing” but the group plans to appeal the case to the Eighth District Court of Appeals. 
“We’re confident that the appellate court will ultimately rule that this federal law is unconstitutional,” Liberty Justice Center said in a statement. “This law has been taking land from farmers for years, and we look forward to continuing to fight this unconstitutional law.” 
Aaron Lehman, president of the intervening Iowa Farmers Union, said he is “very happy” with the dismissal and believes the decision will be upheld, “no matter how far the plaintiffs want to take it.” 
“Farm programs need to have integrity,” Lehman said. “When we have voluntary participation in programs, we expect that it’s going to have conservation compliance attachments that make sense for the farm, make sense for the neighbors and (make) sense for the entire community.” 
Dani Replogle, a staff attorney with Food & Water Watch, said the decision is an “unequivocal victory” for sustainable farms and clean water. 
“The message is clear: we will not let fringe legal theories turn our wetlands into sacrifice zones for corporate landlords,” Replongle said in a statement.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A special session of the North Dakota Legislature is still up in the air as the attorney general reviews options to fix an error with a line-item veto.
Meanwhile, legislative leaders this week directed staff to do legal research on possible scenarios that would prompt the Legislature to come back into session, including a recent appeals court ruling that affects legislative districts.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s general counsel has asked for an attorney general’s opinion on his line-item veto of Senate Bill 2014. Armstrong’s veto message only indicated he objected to a $150,000 grant, but the message was accompanied by red lines crossing out a section of the bill that also included $35 million for the Housing Incentive Fund.

Attorney Chris Joseph wrote in his request for an opinion that the red marking “merely serves as a color-coded visual aid.” He asked for an opinion on whether the governor’s written veto message or the visual pen marks on the bill satisfy the constitutional requirements of a line-item veto.
Mike Nowatzki, spokesman for the governor, said the opinion will determine the next steps. 
Armstrong previously said he would call lawmakers back for a special session if necessary to correct the mistake. Legislative Council estimates a special session would cost $65,000 per day.
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said Wednesday during a meeting of Legislative Management that he asked Legislative Council staff to brief legislative leaders on scenarios that might prompt lawmakers to reconvene.
One question Hogue raised is whether the Legislature has a duty to act in response to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that overturned a 2023 district court ruling that found the state’s 2021 redistricting plan unlawfully diluted the voting power of Native American voters. A federal judge had ordered the Legislature to change its district map, but if the appellate court’s ruling stands, the state would revert back to the 2021 plan. The plaintiffs, which include the Spirit Lake Nation and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, have asked for a rehearing before the full 8th Circuit.
Hogue also asked staff to provide a legal briefing related to the governor’s vetoes and whether that would prompt legislators to reconvene. Armstrong issued seven line-item vetoes on six bills after the session adjourned. 
Previously, Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said a special session was the only obvious legal remedy to fix the error with the veto, but he said this week his staff continue to research the issue.
Other situations that might prompt the Legislature to reconvene are a significant drop in the price of oil that changes the state’s budget outlook or federal funding cuts that have major impacts to state or local subdivisions, Hogue said.
If lawmakers call themselves back into session, they have six remaining days of their 80-day limit. If Armstrong calls a special session, that would not affect the 80-day limit.

The Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals recently charged social worker Jaime L. Roggenbauer of Bettendorf with knowingly making misleading or untrue statements in the practice of social work, or engaging in unethical conduct harmful to the public, by attempting to practice social work while intoxicated. The board also accused her of interfering with her previous employer’s information technology systems.
According to the board, Roggenbauer had provided counseling services at a children’s advocacy center located in Rock Island, Illinois, since January 2022. She was fired on March 19, 2024, the day her co-workers reported that she appeared chatty, animated and unsteady — a departure from her typical demeanor.

The board alleges that Roggenbauer was fired after she refused a chemical test for intoxication. According to the board, she then changed the password to the center’s therapy documentation system, which locked other part-time providers out of the center’s database.
Roggenbauer denied the allegations, but to resolve the case she recently agreed to a settlement that entails her license being placed on probation for two years, during which time she will work with a practice monitor.
Court records show that in 2022, Roggenbauer was convicted of first-offense drunken driving.



Social workers charged with ethics violations
Other Iowans recently sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals include:
— Kelly Sachau of Sioux City, who is alleged to have maintained a relationship with a patient from April 2021 to the present. According to the board, the patient received therapy services from Sachau while the two maintained a personal relationship. In October 2022, Sachau ended her relationship with the practice group where she worked and took the patient’s therapy records and notes with her to her new practice without the patient’s written consent. She was charged with failing to comply with ethics guidelines related to patient boundaries and records.
Sachau denied having a dual relationship with the patient and denied improper handling of client records and information. To settle the case, she agreed to pay a $750 civil penalty and have her license placed on probation for two years during which time she will work with a practice monitor and complete training on ethics, clinical documentation and professional boundaries.
— Trisha Tonelli of Des Moines, who allegedly disclosed confidential information related to the care of a client. She was charged with failing to comply with ethics guidelines on confidentiality, and was issued a warning that similar conduct in the future could result in further disciplinary action. As part of her settlement agreement with the board, Tonelli agreed to complete six hours of ethics training.

(Getty Images)Utah has some of the best infrastructure in the country when compared to other states, although its canals and levees are in need of repair. 
That’s according to the American Society of Civil Engineers’ report card, released Thursday, which gives the Beehive State an overall C+ grade. That’s tied with Georgia and Wisconsin for the highest score of all U.S. states and territories. 
“A C+ means our infrastructure is meeting the needs of Utahns, but there’s still room for improvement,” said Craig Friant, a civil engineer who worked on the report. “This is a sign that we’re doing things well here in Utah.”
While the state has one of the highest grades, the rest of the country is not far behind. The national grade is C, and most states and territories received a C or C- grade — South Carolina and Louisiana each received a D+, West Virginia received a D and Puerto Rico received a D-, the lowest grade. 
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, or ASCE, an A grade is defined as exceptional and fit for the future; B is good and adequate for now; C is mediocre, requiring attention; D is poor and at risk; and F is failing, requiring critical attention and unfit for purpose. 
The report lists 12 separate areas of infrastructure for each state. Consider Utah’s report: 

Aviation: C+
Bridges: B
Canals: D+ 
Dams: C+
Drinking water: B- 
Hazardous waste: C+ 
Levees: D- 
Roads: B+ 
Solid waste: B-
Stormwater: C 
Transportation: B- 
Wastewater: C 

The majority of the state’s levees and canals are old, according to the report — most levees are more than 60 years old, and many of the state’s canals were built in the 19th century for irrigation purposes. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The report also noted that data isn’t readily available for levees and canals, which poses another risk. 
“These are systems that protect households and businesses from flooding, yet we don’t know their condition in many cases, which is a major public safety hazard,” said Friant, who pointed to outdated levees in Salt Lake County that protect residential areas from flooding during runoff or storms. 
These levees don’t currently meet the Army Corps of Engineers standards, putting them at risk of being delisted — if that happens, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, could eventually reclassify the land surrounding the Salt Lake City International and Provo City airports as flood plains, according to the report. That could “drastically” alter how the land is assessed and insured, engineers say. 
Recommendations for improving Utah’s infrastructure
What can the state do to boost its grade? The report gives several recommendations, including more analysis and better funding when it comes to infrastructure. 
“Specifically, detailed written plans are critical for the areas of water resources, canals, transportation, transit, and waste management,” the report reads. “The state should be providing consistent financial support for project improvements, maintenance, resiliency, and risk reduction through reliable funding streams year after year that facilitate this planning.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Prioritizing funding for bridges is another recommendation. Even though Utah received a B, engineers say many of the state’s bridges are nearing the end of their “service lives.” 
The state should also increase funding for its Dam Safety Program. Utah currently has hundreds of dams considered “high hazard,” which means if they fail, it would cause severe damage and loss of life. 
That includes the Panguitch Lake Dam, which showed signs of seepage last year after cracks appeared near the top, likely the result of ice pushing up against the concrete. The roughly 1,700 residents of Panguitch were put on notice to prepare for evacuation, but crews were able to break the ice away and stabilize the dam. 
Utah has a big, expensive and potentially dangerous dam problem

To avoid a repeat scenario, the report recommends the state dump at least $10 million each year into the Dam Safety Program and try to rehabilitate all dams within 50 years. “An increase to $20 million per year would allow faster repairs but could still require 25 years for all required repairs,” the report reads. 
Bolstering “multi-modal” transportation options — like expanding bus or train networks —is another recommendation as the state deals with rapid population growth. 
And lastly, Utah should make sure the Great Salt Lake reaches and remains at healthy levels — replacing canals with pipelines will help reduce evaporation, and could ultimately result in more water flowing to the lake, according to the report.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-584917952-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky, said in a statement that “decisions about health care are and should remain private, and we will not be providing additional details about the dismissal.
“People have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,” Duke said. “We are strategizing our next steps in this fight. In the meantime, our work to address the commonwealth’s maternal mortality rates and lack of widespread paid leave coverage will continue as long as Kentucky remains a forced-birth state.”
Poe’s lawsuit was the fourth challenging Kentucky abortion laws since the United States Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that had protected the right to abortion for almost 50 years. The ruling triggered Kentucky’s ban into effect.
The first challenge, filed by abortion providers, advanced in Jefferson Circuit Court but was rejected on appeal.
In December, a woman filed a lawsuit similar to Poe’s challenge, stating she was pregnant and did not wish to be. Within days of filing her lawsuit, though, the pregnancy lost viability and she ended her challenge of the law.
In two cases, Kentucky courts, including the state Supreme Court, have rejected challenges to the ban on grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the action; the U.S. Supreme Court has likewise avoided ruling on the merits of abortion bans.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-30 21:05:33+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Hosemann, White vow to focus on school choice, teacher pay, K-12 issues in ’26",Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/30/hosemann-white-vow-to-focus-on-school-choice-teacher-pay-k-12-issues-in-26/,The two legislative leaders outlined priorities for 2026 after a contentious special session required because the House and Senate could not pass a budget during regular session.,"One day after concluding a raucous special session to pass a state budget, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and House Speaker Jason White told reporters they’re planning to focus on K-12 education policy next year during the 2026 session. 
Hosemann, the Republican leader of the Senate, said he wants to pass legislation to give public school teachers a pay raise and find a way to allow retired teachers to work in the classroom again. 
“Without an educated workforce, Mississippi’s momentum will not continue,” Hosemann said at a press conference on Friday. 
State law sets the salary for public school teachers based on how much college education they have received and how long they have taught. The last time the Legislature raised teacher salaries was during the 2022 session. 
White, a Republican from West, conducted a press conference Friday, but he excluded some media outlets including Mississippi Today. But according to a recording of the press conference in his Capitol office, White intends to push lawmakers, again, to consider school choice legislation and will form a study committee to conduct hearings on the issue during the summer. 
“Our sister states surrounding us here in the South all have basically open enrollment now,” White said. “Now, are we ready to go that far? Do we have the votes to go that far? I don’t know that. But it’s time we have a real conversation about what is best for kids and parents and not the status quo or what might upset somebody somewhere.” 
Full school choice policies typically give state dollars to families and allow them to use that money for their child’s K-12 education, regardless of whether they attend a public or private school. But it’s unclear if White would push for full school choice or a more moderate measure.
Earlier this year, the speaker pushed the House to vote for a bill that allows students in D and F-rated districts to transfer to another school, public or private. However, the bill died on a legislative deadline without a vote from the entire House. 
The House also passed a public-to-public “open enrollment” bill to allow students to transfer to a public school district located outside of the district they live. But a Senate committee killed the measure without bringing it up for a vote.
Mississippi currently has a very limited form of “open enrollment” that allows students to transfer from their home district to a nearby school district. However, the transfer requires the approval of both the home and receiving school districts. 
The House’s proposal would have prevented the home district from blocking the student’s transfer. 
Hosemann on Friday said he was personally in favor of both of those proposals, but he was unsure if a majority of the Senate would vote for the measures. 
Other priorities White outlined were: 

Continuing to focus on improving the city of Jackson, especially the capital city’s water and sewer systems 
Reforming the public employee retirement system 

Hosemann’s other priorities include: 

Restructuring government agencies and their office space 
Banning student cell phones in public K-12 schools 
Free community college tuition",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05181115/AP23340713371286-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741
,DC,2025-05-30 21:01:25+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Musk departs White House but says DOGE will carry on; won’t comment on report of drug use,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/musk-departs-white-house-says-doge-will-carry-wont-comment-report-drug-use,,"WASHINGTON — Billionaire Elon Musk said Friday he will continue to advise President Donald Trump despite stepping away from his official role as a special government employee.During a wide-ranging Oval Office press conference, Musk — sporting a bruised right eye he blamed on a punch he invited from one of his sons, 5-year-old X — also said he expects U.S. DOGE Service will continue trying to cut at least $1 trillion in federal spending, setting the middle of next year as a target date.“This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning,"" Musk said. ""My time as a special government employee necessarily had to end — it was a limited time thing, it’s 134 days I believe, which ends in a few days. So it comes with a time limit. But the DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger.”Musk then compared his initiative to Buddhism, a religion practiced by hundreds of millions of people, saying DOGE jobs were “like a way of life” that he hoped would permeate throughout the federal government.DOGE’s efforts so far have led to about $160 billion in spending cuts, Musk said. That’s a small fraction of the $6.8 trillion the federal government spent during the most recent fiscal year and short of the goal he set before joining the administration.Musk said DOGE was “relentlessly pursuing” at least $1 trillion in spending cuts to benefit American taxpayers, shortly after pointing out a golden eagle on the ceiling of the Oval Office that Trump said used to be plaster.“Nobody ever really saw it. They didn't know the eagle was up there, and we highlighted it,” Trump said. “Essentially it’s a landmark, a great landmark, and that's 24-karat gold. And everybody loved it. Now, they all see it when they come in. So it's been good.”Musk hailed Trump for ensuring the Oval Office “finally has the majesty that it deserves."" Neither man shared how much was spent to redesign the eagle.Musk plans to refocus his professional efforts on his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.New York Times story on Musk drug useTrump said he “hopes” that Musk continues to advise him on government issues, even though he will no longer be employed by the White House.Republican lawmakers, Trump said, are “totally committed to making the DOGE cuts permanent and stopping much more of the waste in the months to come.”“We want to get our great, big, beautiful bill finished and done,” Trump said, referring to a tax and spending cuts package the House passed earlier this month. “We put some of this into the bill, but most of it's going to come later. We're going to have it (codified) by Congress, affirmed by Congress. In some cases, we’ll make cuts, in some cases we'll just use it in a different layer to save the money. But it's hundreds of billions of dollars.”Musk declined to answer a question about a bombshell New York Times report published earlier in the day that detailed his ongoing use of drugs, including ketamine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms.Trump desires bigger tax cuts from SenateTrump said during the press conference he hopes the U.S. Senate amends the “big, beautiful bill” by cutting more government spending, without specifying which programs.That package would cut about $1.5 trillion in federal funding for several programs during the next decade, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to release its full analysis of the package next week, including how changes made just before the bill went to the floor will impact state budgets and people’s access to safety net programs.Trump also called on senators to further lower taxes in the package,“It's an unbelievable bill…It cuts, you know, it's a huge cutting,” Trump said. “But there's things I'd like to see, maybe cut a little bit more. I'd like to see a bigger cut in taxes. It's going to be the largest tax decrease or cut in the history of our country. I'd like to see it get down to an even lower number. I was shooting for a slightly lower number. I would have liked to have done that.”Trump appeared to renew his call for Congress to completely eliminate the debt limit, even though the tax and spending cuts package would raise that ceiling by $4 trillion.""I agree with Elizabeth Warren on that. I think we should get rid of it,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic senator from Massachusetts. “It's too catastrophic.”",,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Members of the House Committee on Finance on Thursday appeared to see the need for a bill that would let municipalities impose a $2 tax on tickets to large venue events despite opposition from event promoters and business owners.
Providence Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak introduced her bill with a shout-out to her mom in Miami by recounting her mother’s words: “‘Why are you in the news about this ticket tax? What’s the big deal? All big metropolitan areas and cities have taxes like this to support the cities where events are held.’ So thanks, Mom, for that.”  
Kislak’s H6334 was submitted at the request of the Providence City Council as part of a multipronged approach to fend off budget chaos following a multimillion dollar settlement last November between the city and the state education department. Kislak is also the sponsor of H6162,  by Providence Mayor Brett Smiley, which would allow the city to increase its total tax levy in fiscal year 2026 beyond the state-mandated 4% growth cap. 
The tax levy bill passed the House floor 56-17 Tuesday after about an hour of heated discussion, with House Republicans joining progressive Democrats in opposing the bill’s passage. The legislation lingers still in the Senate, where it was heard in committee for the first time, also on Tuesday. 
Kislak’s event ticket tax bill bears the signature of at least one Providence Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. David Morales, who opposed the levy bill, plus five other Providence Democrats, and Democratic Reps. Brandon Potter of Cranston and June Speakman of Warren.
While the bill was designed with Providence in mind, it would authorize any municipality to adopt a local tax of up to $2 per ticket on events held at “large venues,” or those with 800 or more seats, per the bill’s definition. The Division of Taxation would be responsible for collecting the tax and then redistributing it to municipalities.
Revenue from ticket taxes would not count toward the tax levy hike cap codified in state law. That complements the tax levy hike legislation, by allowing towns and cities to up their tax income without risking the chance of going over the 4% annual limit on how much municipalities can raise taxes.    
“Every city and town, increasingly, is facing difficulties in overreliance on property tax as the main workhorse for how we can do our business, how we can take care of city services,” Providence City Council President Rachel Miller told the committee Thursday, adding that the bill “is one kind of tool in the toolbox” to help dig the city out of its fiscal hole.
Miller estimated the new fee could generate around $3 million annually for Providence, which would help offset the rising cost of services in the capital city without discouraging event attendance.
The bill was held for further study Thursday, as is standard practice.
City Council Chief of Staff June Rose said in an email Friday that a Senate companion is in the works.
Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Mayor Smiley, said the city administration is still reviewing the bill. 
The state’s Division of Taxation has read the bill, however, and thinks it needs to be redrafted. In a letter to the committee, Neena Savage, tax administrator, testified that parts of the bill as written are “ambiguous” and suggested filing it under local tax statutes rather than the state’s broader sales tax code. 
Asked about the tax official’s take, Kislak said via text Friday that she was planning to review everything over the weekend, and “would be glad to provide additional clarifications based on the feedback last night.” 
“This is enabling legislation and I’m confident the cities and towns will refine this in locally appropriate ways as they write ordinances, if they so choose,” Kislak wrote.

Concerns about competition
Kislak’s bill managed to coalesce support among her colleagues. It also did the same for the opposition — venue managers and hospitality lobbyists — who showed up Thursday night to oppose the bill, many of whom argued that the proposed fee is small, it will disadvantage Rhode Island in a competitive live entertainment market.
“It’s not so much about passing it on to the patron,” said Dan Schwartz, general manager of The VETS Auditorium. “You know, what we hear when bills like this come up is, ‘We’re just going to skip bringing our show to Rhode Island.’”
Written testimonies opposing the legislation also came from the legal counsel for the Providence Bruins, South Kingstown Town Councilor Jay G. Wégimont, and Joseph Paolino Jr., former Providence mayor and noted downtown real estate magnate.
“This legislation targets the very institutions that help drive Providence’s economic engine, and at the worst possible time,” Paolino wrote, adding that his luxury hotel The Beatrice is always booked when a popular show or game is in town. 
Contrasting the naysayers was the Finance Committee, including a relentless Rep. Teresa Tanzi. The South Kingstown Democrat asked many questions of the industry advocates who came to testify, although she was befuddled as to why they even showed up.  
“This $2 thing — I’m shocked that you guys are even here opposing it, to be quite honest with you,” Tanzi said. “Because in the larger scheme of things, your ticket holders are being ripped off on so many other levels, and the city is being inconvenienced on so many other levels.”
Tanzi suggested that if proprietors were truly concerned about ticket prices, they would investigate different options for ticket delivery — like Dice, a platform that allows people to resell tickets only at face value, and only through its own app, rather than secondary markets.
Tanzi also grilled Lawrence Lepore, the general manager of the Amica Mutual Pavilion. Tanzi asked Lepore to what extent the state subsidizes its largest concert venue at 14,000 seats. Lepore replied it’s about $27 million a year, including debt service. 
“So you’re not self-sustaining anyway,” Tanzi said.
“The operation is self-sustaining. But of course, the debt service is not,”  Lepore replied.
“We subsidize it to a tune of $27 million a year?” Tanzi asked.
“That’s correct,” Lepore said, and Tanzi concluded with a “Thank you. Thank you very much.”

Taxpayers subsidize big venues
Rich Lupo sold his titular concert venue in 2017, but the longtime music promoter warned that Providence is already “a secondary city in the booking world.”
“[This bill] would just piss them off,” Lupo said of booking companies. “I think it could be $1, it could be $10. You just don’t want to anger the powerful agencies, and bands as well.”
From his seat on the committee, bill co-sponsor Hull was canny with Lupo, pointing out that he’s known him for decades, and fondly recalls how Lupo grew his titular venue since opening it in 1975.    
“I’ve seen what you’re capable of doing,” Hull told Lupo.
That’s why Hull was firm that the businesses should be capable of weathering a $2 surcharge — especially places like the Amica Mutual Pavilion, which is housed in the tax-exempt Rhode Island Convention Center but still benefits from city services.  
Sharon Steele, speaking on behalf of the Jewelry District Association, disagreed. She pointed to another Smiley proposal and Kislak bill for a 7% “consumption tax” on the city’s parking lots and garages. The ticket tax would add “insult to injury” for downtown venues already burdened by tax policies, she said.
Hull told Steele he subscribes to the Rhode Island Philharmonic — Steele was once on its board — then narrowed his eyes, smiled, and made a case for the value of expression: “The arts are special. And if I had to pay an extra $2 to see the arts, I’d be more than happy to pay it.” 
“I appreciate that, but the Philharmonic’s not doing well these days,” Steele said, adding that such plights are common right now for nonprofits. “And we’re sure not getting any help from the feds.”
“The $2 is necessary,” Hull replied.

(Courtesy photo)It remained unclear on Friday who will become the treasurer for New Mexico’s ruling political party, following the previous treasurer’s resignation after just one month on the job.
Julie Rochman, of Albuquerque, resigned as treasurer for the Democratic Party of New Mexico on Wednesday, in a resignation letter addressed to all of the party’s members, who elected her and the rest of its leadership on April 26.
Rochman wrote she is concerned DPNM’s officers don’t reflect New Mexico’s diversity. Including herself, three of the four officers are not originally from New Mexico, two are older white women, one comes from a rural area and none speak Spanish, she wrote.
“Most distressing to me, in our minority-majority Hispanic state, is DPNM’s lack of a single Hispanic executive,” Rochman wrote. “This is a glaring deficit and strategic negligence.”
Rochman wrote the party should replace her with “someone who represents the very people we’ve overlooked for too long — ideally a Hispanic leader rooted in a rural space.”
DPNM spokesperson Daniel Garcia told Source NM on Friday party rules do not determine a timeline for replacing its treasurer, however, “DPNM wants to move expeditiously in finding a replacement to fulfill the position’s work without interruption.”
The new treasurer will be selected by the party’s officers, Garcia said, including Chair Sara Attleson, Vice Chair Cam Crawford, Secretary Brenda Hoskie and the three congressional district vice chairs. 
“Right now there are not specific individuals under consideration, but the process will be conducted in a thorough, transparent process,” Garcia said.
Rochman wrote that Attleson and Crawford “have squashed efforts for all officers to work together as a team” and “intentionally excluded” her.
“They don’t inform or engage with me,” Rochman wrote. “In short, they’ve made clear that my expertise and input are unwelcome.”
In a statement, Attleson denied Rochman’s allegations that she wasn’t welcome in the party, and defended its leaders’ diversity.
“Contrary to her letter, we welcomed Julie to be a part of the movement we’re building,” Attleson said. “Unfortunately, shortly after the election, she decided this team wasn’t an ideal fit for her.”
Attleson pointed to the majority of New Mexico’s statewide and federal elected leaders being Hispanic, including Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, along with several of the congressional district vice chairs.
Rochman told Source NM it is great that so many elected officials in New Mexico are Hispanic, “but it doesn’t excuse the fact that the party doesn’t look like the state.”
Attleson also pointed to Crawford’s background as a young Black man, and Hoskie’s membership in the Navajo Nation and fluency in Diné.
“New Mexico Democrats proudly draw our strength from our diversity, which is apparent in our leadership,” Attleson said. “At a time when billionaires are dictating public policy and Donald Trump is eliminating essential services, we have to stay focused on fighting for working class New Mexicans, not turning on each other.”
‘Trumpian’ nondisclosure agreement refused
Rochman wrote that she received a nondisclosure agreement in late May after weeks of no communication about ongoing party affairs and strategic planning. Rochman told Source NM in an interview that Sean Ward, the party’s executive director, asked her to sign it.
A copy of the unsigned NDA shows it would have barred Rochman from saying or doing anything that would damage the reputation of any of the party’s officers, staff or volunteers.
Rochman wrote in her letter that the NDA is inconsistent with her values and undermines her right to free speech and her obligation to speak truth to power.
“Essentially, it would be a gag order for the rest of my life,” she wrote.
Rochman told Source NM that she feels the document’s non-disparagement language “was very targeted” at her because she doesn’t get along with Attleson.
“It seemed very Trumpian to me,” Rochman said. “There had been some other things that were rather Trumpian, and I just didn’t want to be associated with an administration that was going to govern that way.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s tenure as a special government employee in the White House came to an end Friday, prompting Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost to say that his efforts reveal that a “corporate slash and burn mentality is not how you run a country.”
Musk had been leading the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which, according to its website, last updated on May 26, saved taxpayers an estimated $175 billion. However, one watchdog website tracking the cuts says it was more like $16 billion.
  Maxwell Frost via U.S. House
But there were significant cuts that have been damaging, including to international medical and food assistance programs. “The legacy will be a dark legacy,” Frost told a Phoenix reporter on Friday during an interview on WMNF-88.5 FM in Tampa.
Among the first and most prominent budget cancellations that came from DOGE was to dissolve the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has funded the majority of U.S. humanitarian and development assistance worldwide to people. That included stopping funding to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), an HIV prevention program that has operated through USAID since 2003.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that it was “a lie” to say that anybody around the world has died because of the USAID cuts. However, through a modelling program, a research team at Boston University that studies infectious diseases has estimated that the loss of lives from USAID cuts stands at more than 300,000 worldwide, with more than 200,000 of those being children.
“These USAID cuts are devastating,” Frost said. “Global health is important to health here. The projections on HIV on how that is going to explode globally … and we could see an epidemic of HIV again in the United States over the coming years because of the way that  people travel.”
A study published this week by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported that the Trump administration and DOGE have implemented new phone service restrictions that the Social Security Administration estimates will require people to make nearly 2 million additional trips to understaffed Social Security field offices every year.
“I’ve been speaking with folks who receive disability from SSI [Supplemental Security Income] who literally [say] the wait times are longer than they’ve ever been,” Frost said. “People are dying, waiting for the benefits that they deserve. And so these cuts were not made in good faith.”
Codifying DOGE
Musk and other conservatives like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have bemoaned that President Trump’s major tax and spending bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives last week doesn’t codify the spending cuts made by DOGE over the past four months. However, House Speaker Mike Johnson says that Congress will vote to codify those cuts of up to $9 billion in a bill that will soon be introduced in the House.
“People are seeing impacts now, but they’ll see impacts years into the future as well,” says Frost. “I think this bill that Johnson is bringing to codify some of the DOGE cuts in part is meant to placate Elon. It’s why the bill is coming up at the exact moment that he is leaving.”
While progressives like Frost hailed Musk’s departure from Washington, Florida Republicans were celebrating his accomplishments Friday afternoon.
“Under @elonmusk, @DOGE has done a phenomenal job identifying and helping cancel waste, fraud, and abuse from government,” said Southwest Florida Congressman and 2026 gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds on X. “As we carry out the annual appropriations process this summer, Congress must follow the lead of DOGE and eliminate this egregious spending once and for all.”
“Just like he launched @SpaceX beyond the stars, @elonmusk propelled @DOGE into orbit — leading the charge to cut waste, fraud, and abuse at hypersonic speed,” said Jacksonville U.S. Rep. Aaron Bean on X. “His vision for transparency and accountability will continue to reshape government spending and push for real fiscal responsibility. The mission isn’t slowing down — it’s only gaining altitude!”
‘Special government employee’
In his announcement reintroducing legislation this week that would require federal agencies and departments to verify the eligibility of individuals 105 years of age or older for federal benefits. Sarasota area U.S. Rep. Greg Steube credited DOGE for bringing attention to the issue.
“No American who has paid into Social Security and Medicare should see their benefits compromised by scam artists or incompetent bureaucrats,” Rep. Steube said in a statement. “It shouldn’t have required DOGE examining the rolls to ensure 12 million Americans listed as 120 years old or more were finally properly recorded as deceased.”
(The Associated Press reported earlier this year that Musk’s claims that “tens of millions” of dead people receiving Social Security checks was “overstated.”)
As a “special government employee,” Musk was forced to end his tenure at the White House on Friday because federal law says such employees are appointed to perform temporary duties “for a period not to exceed 130 days during any period of 365 days.”
Frost said that Musk’s temporary status as a federal employee was “misused” and predicted that “when Democrats take back the House we’re going to have to put some guardrails on that designation because it was misused for Elon Musk.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-30 20:54:03+00:00,CT Mirror,CT approves unemployment benefits for strikers; veto expected,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/30/ct-unemployment-benefits-striking-workers/,Passing the bill despite Lamont’s promised veto reflects the influence of organized labor and Democrats’ desire to be recorded on the issue.,"A bill that would add Connecticut to the short list of states providing jobless benefits to strikers won final passage Friday, an organized labor victory muted by Gov. Ned Lamont’s promised veto.
The unusual decision by House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, to allot scarce time for a bill opposed by the governor reflects the influence of organized labor and desires of the House Democratic majority caucus to be recorded on the issue.
“It’s a big policy implication for a large swath of the caucus on an issue that you know they feel passionate about, particularly in light of the national federal government’s changes to the ability to collectively bargain,” Ritter said.
Lamont, a Democrat who has twice been elected with significant labor support, and the House Republican minority said removing the prohibition on strikers from getting unemployment benefits is a distinction Connecticut cannot afford as it tries to improve its economy and shed an anti-business reputation.
“I support the right to organize. I’m going to oppose any efforts to interfere with that right coming out of Washington, D.C.,” Lamont said. “If you want to make sure this is a state that grows and adds good paying jobs for people, I don’t think that striking worker bill is the way to go.”
The promised veto is a source of friction with labor as the governor nears an expected decision on whether to seek a third term as governor, something 60% of Democrats favor, according to a University of New Hampshire poll.
Connecticut is one of the most highly unionized states in the U.S., but overall membership has faltered since the 1980s, especially among private-sector workers. Only 6.7% of private-sector workers are unionized in the state, compared to 67% of state and municipal employees.
Ed Hawthorne, the president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, said the labor federation still hoped Lamont might reconsider his veto, but the passage by the General Assembly would be significant nonetheless as unions look for ways to show influence in a difficult time for labor.
“In Connecticut, we need to lead. And, you know, the labor movement in Connecticut is strong, and we need to show the rest of the nation what you know our values are,” Hawthorne said.
Connecticut has been early in other labor advances that took root elsewhere, notably the nation’s first mandate on private employers to offer sick days or other paid time off, a paid family and medical leave program, and an hourly minimum wage exceeding $16.
Labor advocates say the strikers’ benefits bill is a necessary counter to the advantages most employers have at the bargaining table, especially since the Trump administration has left the National Labor Relations Board with insufficient members to act and shrunk the ranks of labor mediators.
“This really is a fight against the Donald Trump administration,” Hawthorne said. “It’s more important than ever, because we don’t have a backstop right now. You saw it in the Pratt & Whitney strike.”
The International Association of Machinists recently ended a 23-day strike at the jet-engine manufacturer. The union says if Connecticut had strikers’ benefits, the settlement would have come sooner.
In a letter to lawmakers urging the rejection of Senate Bill 8, the company’s parent, RTX Corporation, asserted that the opposite was true.
“The just-completed Pratt strike underscores this,” wrote Peter Holland, the vice president for state and local government relations. “It’s reasonable to assume employees would have withheld their labor much longer, holding out for a more valuable offer from Pratt.”
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said the House debate Friday was a dangerous, if confusing, political gesture by Democrats.
“Obviously we scratch our heads over spending a day on a striking workers bill that we know the governor wants to veto,” Candelora said. “We think it certainly sends the wrong message to our business community. Even the fact that we’re taking that bill up is really dangerous.”
Candelora noted that Pratt has manufacturing plants outside of Connecticut.
“I think that bill goes well beyond politics,” he said. “I am really concerned the same way the governor is concerned of the message that it sends to our business community and the impact it could actually have.”
Hawthorne agreed the bill sends a message but not the one articulated by Candelora and the governor.
“There’s a clear choice with this bill on who you stand with when you show up to a picket line,” Hawthorne said. “Are you standing with the workers? Or are you standing with the CEOs that have forced them out there?”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7657-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

Festivals, shows and parties celebrating LGBTQ+ Vermonters are happening from Springfield to Newport this June.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerAnytime the Savoy Theater in Montpelier shows the Rocky Horror Picture Show, they’re cleaning up the theater for weeks, according to the theater’s marketing director, Leah Fishman. The cult classic features audience participation moments, including $5 prop bags full of messy objects like handfuls of uncooked rice. But Fishman said the cleanup was well worth the trouble. “It takes weeks, but we never regret it. It’s always so fun,” she said. Rocky Horror is one of six cinematic events planned for the theater’s Queer Film Festival, a three-week-long celebration of LGBTQ+ films and shorts, both modern and classic. The festival, now in its fourth year, is one of Vermont’s many events celebrating Pride Month this June. Pride Month events stretch all the way from Springfield to Newport, along with Bethel, Rutland, Morrisville, Barre and Essex, according to the Pride Center of Vermont. It kicks off two days early with Montpelier Pride on Friday, which includes a parade, music on the Statehouse lawn and street art. Just don’t look for Burlington on the list of June events: Vermont’s largest city has its annual Pride event scheduled for September, according to the Pride Center. Along with town-sponsored events, local venues have planned a wide variety of Pride-themed entertainment. Barre LGBTQ+ bar Foxy’s has an amateur drag night slated for June 7, while Babes Bar in Bethel has Gay Trivia planned on June 26 with the motto “Anyone can play but it’s gonna be gay.”One of Savoy’s screenings has a Babes Bar tie-in: “One Night at Babes,” the first of its Queer Shorts events, depicts the bar’s connections to the LGBTQ+ community and its rural neighbors, Fishman said.Another film at the festival, the surreal trans allegory “I Saw the TV Glow,” had its Vermont premiere at the Green Mountain Film Festival in 2024, but the Savoy never had the chance to screen it. Montpelier Pride was held on the lawn of the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 30. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“We’ve had it sort of in our back pocket for a while, hoping for a chance and sort of saving it for Pride,” Fishman said. Fishman said the film festival was inspired by the love of “queer cinema” among Savoy staff members, some of whom are LGBTQ+ themselves. “We’re looking for a way to sort of share and bring new people and new voices into the theater,” she said. “Whether that be through highlighting new filmmakers or sharing stories that they love, that perhaps the community hasn’t seen yet, or engaging folks in the community in a new way and really celebrating queer voices.”Kell Arbor, health and wellness director for the Pride Center, helped select the films this year and chose ones that would bring out a mix of “the youths and the elders.” A portion of ticket sales will go to the Pride Center as well.Along with helping to organize Montpelier’s pride events, Arbor plans to be “DJ Kell” at a pride-themed silent disco just over the border in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on June 16. Arbor, whose pronouns are fae/faer, said the Pride Month festivities were even more essential this year as the Trump administration rolled back federal funding for HIV prevention and other LGBTQ+ health care in Vermont. “It’s hard to come in joy and pleasure when we’re living in such trauma, pain and grief — and, we need it more than ever, and the brighter we’re beaconing, the more it’s helping other people feel like they’re not alone,” fae said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Queer Film Fest kicks off Pride Month in central Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/montpelier-pride-1-20250530-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-30 20:50:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut leaders respond to ‘sanctuary’ designation by federal government,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/30/ct-trump-sanctuary-jurisdiction/,Six CT cities and the state itself were on the Trump administration’s list of ‘sanctuary jurisdictions’ publicly released on Thursday night.,"When Mayor Justin Elicker learned that New Haven was on a list of six “sanctuary cities” designated by the federal government in Connecticut, he said he wasn’t surprised. 
“This is something we expected, and we are proud of it. New Haven is proudly a welcoming city. It’s one of our defining characteristics and values,” Elicker said at a press conference on Friday. 
On Thursday night, the Department of Homeland Security released a list of over 500 cities, counties and states that the agency deems “sanctuary jurisdictions.” Included on that list are six Connecticut cities — East Haven, New Haven, Windham, New London, Hartford and Hamden — and the state of Connecticut itself. 
“Sanctuary city” does not have a clear legal definition, but the Trump Administration defines it as areas that “obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws, according to the federal government’s website. 
“Sanctuary jurisdictions including cities, counties, and states that are deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities. Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in peril,” a press release from the department reads. 
State leaders and local elected officials from the six cities have responded to the designation in a variety of ways: with pride, confusion and denial. 
“That’s a mystery to me. I really have no idea where [President Donald Trump] is coming from,” Mayor Michael Passero of New London told the Connecticut Mirror on Friday. 
Passero said New London has always followed federal and state law. He said a person’s immigration status isn’t relevant to local law enforcement, and it’s not their policy to ask. But he said that shouldn’t qualify the city as a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” 
Passero said New London, which has always considered itself welcoming to immigrants, may not fit with Trump’s idea of what America should look like. 
“New London has always been, for 400 years, a multicultural city, because we’re a seaport,” he said, adding that his own parents were immigrants. 
Mayors Lauren Garrett of Hamden and Arunan Arulampalam of Hartford underscored the variety of backgrounds that make up their cities’ populations and criticized the federal government’s statements.  
“Hamden is a place that prides itself on diversity, we respect all of our neighbors, and we are in complete compliance with state and federal law. We will not be bullied by a federal administration that clearly does not understand how the law works, nor will we play into their game of shifting focus away from their campaign of defunding essential public services,” Garrett wrote in a statement. 
Arulampalam said in a statement that he was committed to “ensuring that every resident, regardless of where they come from or what their story is, has the opportunity to succeed.”
“While my administration remains laser-focused on real solutions that protect our community, it is clear that current federal policies do not share this commitment to safety and threaten to undermine the gains we have made,” Arulampalam added.
Mayor Joseph Carfora of East Haven called the designation “absurd” and “baseless.” He said the town planned to reach out to the Department of Homeland Security “to understand how such an unfounded statement was made without any consultation or communication with our office.” 
State Officials Respond
Both Attorney General William Tong and Gov. Ned Lamont said the Trump administration’s claim that Connecticut had “self-identified” as a sanctuary jurisdiction was false. 
“There is nothing in our laws or statutes that says Connecticut is a ‘sanctuary’ state. We are not. That is a meaningless term,” Tong said in a statement. 
But Republican lawmakers pointed to the legislature’s recent passage of a bill that will expand the state’s Trust Act — Connecticut’s law outlining the circumstances under which local and state officials may work and communicate with the federal government’s efforts to detain unauthorized migrants. The bill received final passage earlier this week; Lamont has not yet signed it.
“It’s no surprise the Department of Homeland Security labeled Connecticut and several of its communities as ‘sanctuary jurisdictions,’” House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said in a statement on Friday. “Democrats in the legislature have taken extreme positions, expanding the Trust Act far beyond its original purpose of protecting victims and maintaining safety. Instead, it now shields illegal immigrants who are endangering our communities.”
The current Trust Act, which was passed in 2019, generally prohibits Connecticut law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a detainer — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that police hold a person for up to 48 hours so federal agents can pick them up — with some exceptions.
Local law enforcement and corrections officials in Connecticut may only comply with a federal detainer request if ICE presents a judicial warrant, if the person is on a terrorist watch list or if the person in their custody has been convicted or pleaded guilty to a class A or B felony — crimes like murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery and first-degree manslaughter.
House Republicans drafted a letter to Lamont earlier this week asking that he veto the Trust Act expansion, which allows individuals to sue over alleged violations of the law, but also adds 13 new crimes to the list of those for which state and local law enforcement can comply with a federal detainer request. 
In the letter, Republicans said they felt the law “too often protects individuals who pose real threats to our communities, rather than promoting safety and cooperation.”
Senate Minority Leader Steven Harding, R-Brookfield, and Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, referred to Connecticut in a statement as a “super sanctuary state” and said the expanded Trust Act would “further hinder federal law enforcement and burden property taxpayers.”
But House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said he didn’t think the “sanctuary” designation should change the legislature’s decision to go forward with the Trust Act expansion. He said lawmakers had discussions with immigration advocates about trying to ensure the bill didn’t result in retaliation from the federal government, which could hurt the same people the bill was trying to help. 
“ But at the end of the day, you can’t totally compromise on your values because of political threats and intimidation,” Rojas told CT Mirror. 
Rojas said he didn’t have an opinion about the “sanctuary state” designation. “ I think about the people who are just trying to live their lives, raise their families, go to work. If there’s a level of confidence that we can give them that they’re welcome here, I think we should do that,” he said. 
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said in a statement that Connecticut was not a “sanctuary jurisdiction.”
“The Trump Administration is continues to use divisive language to frighten and confuse people,” Ritter said. 
Lamont spokesperson Rob Blanchard said Lamont plans to sign the Trust Act expansion that lawmakers approved. 
“Connecticut’s Trust Act, which was originally bipartisan, is consistent with federal constitutional standards and reflects sound public safety priorities. I am focused on making sure people feel safe in our schools, churches, and elsewhere. Nothing about this makes Connecticut a ‘sanctuary’ in any legal or practical sense – it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said in a statement. 
Elicker said at the press conference that he, too, wanted New Haven residents to feel safe going about their lives. 
“We want our residents to be comfortable calling the police to report a crime… we want our residents to seek out healthcare should they need it. We want to make sure our immigrant children are comfortable and safe going to school,” Elicker said.  
He said New Haven did not “obstruct justice,” but that they also would not take on the federal government’s responsibility for immigration enforcement. 
“Our police department has already too many things to worry about without having to be commandeered by the federal government to implement an unjust and inappropriate policy,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP_Hartford_skyline-1024x629.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

Each week, the clerk of the House of Representatives publishes a report of the bills that Gov. Janet Mills has signed into law and those that she has allowed to become law without the endorsement of her signature. 
Those reports have become more robust as dozens of bills have received passage and enactment votes during each House and Senate session in recent weeks.
Since May 23, Mills has signed 45 pieces of legislation into law, according to the report published Friday. The new statutes protect confidential information for utility customers, advance energy storage, and call for the removal of toxic firefighting foam concentrate from the former Brunswick Naval Air Station.
While most of the new laws won’t take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns for the session, 10 included specific language to take effect upon the governor’s signature. 
There were also a handful of bills that became law without Mills’ signature. They include:

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s proposal to implement work requirements for Medicaid expansion could be “an exercise in futility” now that the federal government is also considering it, said state Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff.
The state began drafting its proposal immediately following the end of the state legislative session in March, Althoff said, before debates about work requirements heated up at the congressional level.
Department officials presented their plan at the state Board of Social Services meeting Friday morning via video conference, just before the first of two public hearings on the proposal.
“Respectfully, humbly, we ask for your grace,” Althoff told board members, “because we’re asking for your feedback on something that might be obsoleted by the vote of 100 senators and the stroke of a pen from our president.”
Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for people with low incomes. South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, a decision that allowed the state to capitalize on a 90% federal funding match — funding that could be in jeopardy, pending the outcome of congressional action. Last year, voters passed another constitutional amendment to let the state seek approval from the federal government to impose work requirements on expansion enrollees.
Difference between SD and federal proposals
At the federal level, proposed Medicaid work requirements would mandate those between ages 19 and 65 who rely on the program to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours each month. The work requirement would be applied at the time of application, and Medicaid renewal would be changed to every six months instead of an annual basis.
Health care advocates form coalition urging Republicans to take their ‘Hands Off Medicaid’

South Dakota’s plan would require adult Medicaid recipients work, train, attend school or serve as a caretaker for a child or elderly or disabled person in their home unless they meet an exception. Compliance with the state-level work rules would be reviewed on an annual basis, at the time of Medicaid renewal, rather than at the time of application. The state would not require a set number of hours of work or education time.
Heather Petermann, Medicaid director at the department, said the requirement would be a “complement” to Medicaid to “encourage” work without “trying to track arbitrary work hours.” 
“This approach really recognizes that for many individuals who need assistance with health care, that comes first,” Petermann said. “Then it allows them to maintain their health so that they can work, or obtain the health needed to seek employment.”
The federal government also has more exceptions in its proposal than the state, including tribal community members, people who are in foster care or were in foster care who are younger than 26, and people released from incarceration in the last 90 days.
South Dakota would allow exceptions for people who are:

Pregnant or postpartum.
Disabled, as determined by the Social Security Administration.
Diagnosed with cancer or another serious or terminal medical condition by a physician.
In an intensive behavioral health treatment program, hospitalized or living in a nursing home.
In an area with unemployment 20% or more above the national average and are exempt from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents.

As of last month, 30,542 South Dakotans were covered by the Medicaid expansion. The state estimates 80% of them already work or qualify for an exception.
SD seeks Medicaid work rules in spite of similar moves by Congress

The proposed state-level work requirement would reduce enrollment by an estimated 5-10% in the first year. That would save the Medicaid program between $48.9 million and $71 million in the first year, the department says.
The federal proposal as it stands now will cost more administratively than South Dakota’s proposed work requirements, Althoff added. States “will be asked to absorb” costs if the federal proposal is adopted. The state’s proposal requires less administrative oversight to reduce anticipated costs, due in part to the state’s tight budget approved by the Legislature this year.
“That’s just sort of naming the tension about how not having new funds is sort of an important wrinkle to our development process,” Althoff said. “It’s really having to be done within an existing budget.”
Board member Colleen Winter said the proposal is “respectful” of the individuals the department serves.
Work requirements are already in place for some federal programs, such as SNAP, and state efforts, such as child care assistance and parental reunification expectations within Child Protection Services.
Department hears from one person during public hearing
While more than 20 people sat in on a virtual public hearing regarding the state’s proposed Medicaid work requirements on Friday, only one member of the public spoke.
Attorney Nathaniel Amdur-Clark spoke on behalf of the Great Plains Tribal Leaders Health Board. He said his client wants to see an exception for Indian Health Service beneficiaries.
Native Americans who are tribal enrolled members are eligible to receive health care services through the federal Indian Health Service. Those individuals are eligible for Medicaid coverage even if they do not meet other Medicaid requirements, such as income limits, “to implement and further trust and treaty obligations the U.S. has to provide health care” for tribal members, Amdur-Clark said. 
Though Althoff and Petermann did not respond to Amdur-Clark’s comments about IHS patients, they did address the subject during the earlier board meeting. Petermann said the proposal includes “geographic exemptions,” including areas of the state with “high unemployment.”
“Things like that would also apply to tribal members and American Indians, but we otherwise did not call out or exclude American Indians,” Petermann said. “The approach is that this is a benefit and we want that dignity and pride to be part of the benefit for everybody, so they would be treated the same in this approach.”
Amdur-Clark added that there are technical concerns regarding exemptions in the proposal and that more work is needed to achieve “real tribal consultation.” The department met with some tribal leaders last week to discuss the proposal, Althoff said.

Shelly Ten Napel, CEO of the Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas, said in an emailed statement that her organization is monitoring state and federal work requirement proposals closely. The group did not give input at the first public meeting, but plans to share its perspective on state work requirements during the public comment period.
Ten Napel opposed last year’s ballot measure authorizing the state’s pursuit of work requirements. Compared to the work requirement proposal being considered in Congress, Ten Napel said, the state proposal is “overall pretty reasonable.”
Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration “did a careful job of responding to concerns” raised during the debate last year, Ten Napel said, including administrative burdens and exceptions.
“We look forward to working with them to ensure smooth implementation of the new rules if they are approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,” Ten Napel said in the statement. “We also encourage members of Congress to take a careful look at the common sense approach South Dakota is taking and rethink some of the heavy-handed rules currently under consideration in the Big Beautiful Bill.”
The “big beautiful bill” is the budget reconciliation legislation that the U.S. House sent to the Senate last week, including a Medicaid work requirements provision.
Petermann said during the board meeting that South Dakota could perhaps seek to impose its own work requirements, even if the federal legislation passes.
“For example, some of the draft language does include references to things like ‘the provisions from the federal legislation cannot be waived,’ but we don’t know whether that means states still could or couldn’t have something that is less or more restrictive, as long as it has the same components,” Petermann said. “We really don’t know for sure yet.”
If the state moves forward, it will submit an application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in July or August. After that, the proposal would go through a federal comment period and application review.
The department’s next public hearing on the proposed Medicaid work requirements is set for 11 a.m. Central on June 12 at the Sioux Falls office of the Department of Social Services, and online.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)COLFAX – A long-anticipated bridge replacement project over North Fork of the Palouse River is being postponed until 2029 because of the state’s transportation budget shortfall.
“We were ready to go. In fact, the ad date was supposed to be October,” said Ryan Overton, communications manager for Washington State Department of Transportation’s eastern region.
The $13 million project would have replaced two aging bridges on State Route 26 and U.S. Highway 195 with a single structure designed to accommodate wide loads, heavy truck traffic, and a shared-use path at the north end of town. A roundabout was also planned to improve traffic flow at the intersection of the two highways.
“We are trying to understand why it was postponed,” Overton said.
He said WSDOT had been working with the community since December 2022, having town halls with the city council, farmers and the trucking community to ensure they got local feedback on the project.
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, one bridge was built in 1931, with an average of 6,470 in daily traffic. The other, built in 1936, has an average of 243 in daily traffic.
Both bridges are rated in “fair condition,” according to the transportation department.
Matt Hammer, public works director for Colfax, said the delay won’t cause immediate issues but could lead to higher costs in the future because of inflation. He also said the city is in the midst of designing a water improvement upgrade; the new bridge was going to support a new water pipe for future development.
“There’s no leaks happening, but the current Highway 26 bridge supports our water pipeline,” Hammer said.
Since they were notified of the delay, he said the city is scaling back its water infrastructure project until WSDOT provides further updates.
“It’s not really hurting us right now, but we put some time and effort and a little bit of money into planning for something that didn’t work out for us,” Hammer said.
Casey Jones, manager and part owner of Jones Truck and Implement, said his business has been involved in discussions with WSDOT about replacing the bridge for about a decade. While he’s not immediately affected by the delay, the main concern is the life expectancy of the two aging bridges.
“We just had the largest tax increase in Washington state’s history that I’m aware of, so resources are limited for building projects, and there are hundreds of bridges that are at the end of life in Washington state,” Jones said. “Nobody knows what the life expectancy for sure is of those bridges, but they’ve served this community very well.”
The only major issue he recalled was a 1996 flood that forced the closure of Highway 195 when water levels reached the bottom of one of the bridges.
“The water was cresting and hitting the bottom of the bridge. So that had been the only case where there had been a possible failure,” Jones said.
Jones raised concerns about how the proposed roundabout would affect large agricultural equipment with the amount of traffic and heavy hauling that runs through the area north of Colfax, including for grain, hay and livestock. He said moving into the new bridge design and having the roundabout has been a “scary proposition,” because farmers and truckers are going from four lanes across that area to 2½.
“It’s a pretty important piece of infrastructure for our whole farming community,” Jones said.
Overton said WSDOT remains committed to the bridge replacement project and will continue working with local community members in the lead-up to 2029.
“We’ve been able to work with WSDOT to come up with a design that will fit our region and fit for future growth of our region and look forward to the improvement,” Jones said.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Ivy Tech Community College will lay off 202 employees statewide as it responds to significant cuts in state funding and frozen tuition rates, the school system’s president, Sue Ellspermann, announced Friday.
The layoffs — affecting both full-time and part-time workers — represent about 2.8% of Ivy Tech’s total workforce, including 180 full-time positions, or 5.3% of its full-time staff, according to data provided by the college. The reductions include 38 faculty members, 162 staff and two administrative faculty.
In a Friday letter to school employees, Ellspermann said the layoffs are a result of a $54 million shortfall over two years, driven by a 5% cut in state appropriations to higher education institutions. An additional 5% in potential funding held in reserve by the State Budget Agency deepened the financial strain.
“Because the college’s primary revenue sources are state appropriations, tuition, and fees, these developments have had an immediate effect on our planning,” Ellspermann wrote in her letter. “We have reached the difficult decision to adjust our staffing levels, in addition to efforts to reduce our operational expenses.”
Story continues below.
Important Budget Update and Staffing Changes
“Staffing reductions are always difficult decisions that we do not make lightly,” Ellspermann continued. “These changes do not reflect the value of their work, but rather the harsh financial reality we currently face.”
Layoffs began Friday and will continue into next week. Affected Ivy Tech workers will receive separation packages, according to Ellspermann’s letter.
The largest number of layoffs occurred at the college’s Systems Office in Indianapolis, which is slated to lose 44 employees. Among the other campus cuts are 21 staff in Indianapolis; 14 each in Bloomington and Columbus; 12 in Kokomo; 11 in Evansville; and another 11 in South Bend/Elkhart.
 


The General Assembly appropriated about $243 million and $245 million for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years, respectively. The latest state budget passed earlier this year will drop that funding to about $236 million in both the 2025-26 and 2026-27 fiscal years.
In a separate letter sent to state lawmakers on Friday, Ellspermann said that student services and academic quality remain priorities, noting that all 19 campuses across Indiana will remain operational. She emphasized that the college has no tenured faculty and “will have the continued ability to adjust the size of our faculty nimbly as enrollment and industry needs fluctuate.”
Ellspermann added that Ivy Tech has previously implemented other cost-saving measures, including rolling technology fees into tuition and eliminating distance education charges, which together cost the college more than $9 million annually in lost revenue.
“This is a challenging moment for our college, but I know Ivy Tech is strong,” Ellspermann said. “I remain confident in our resilience and in our commitment to our students and to one another.”

[…]","The entrance to the Montana Supreme Court (Photo by Eric Seidle/ For the Daily Montanan).In a sprawling, 61-page decision that had about as many opinions attached to it as members of Montana’s highest court, a majority of justices said that the State of Montana, specifically the governor’s office, should pay attorneys fees in a public documents fight between the office and groups wanting more information about a mining executive.
However, the particular details before the court were not whether a former mining executive should be permitted to lead a mining company after his former company was found to be a “bad actor” by state law. Instead, the Montana Supreme Court weighed in on when the government should pay attorneys fees in the public records dispute.
In a fractured mix of majority, concurring and dissenting opinions, at least four justices agreed that Lewis and Clark District Judge Christopher Abbott should have given attorneys fees to the Montana Environmental Information Center and Earthworks, which had sued Gov. Greg Gianforte for documents related to Phillips S. Baker, Jr., and permitting documents related to both Hecla Mining and the Montanore mine. The MEIC argued that the state had not enforced its “bad actor” provision against Baker, the Hecla CEO, because of his leadership in a company that went went bankrupt, while leaving millions of dollars of mining mess to be taken care of in perpetuity by the state.
MEIC and Earthworks, which won the public documents fight against the governor, also asked for attorneys fees because they brought the lawsuit under the Montana Constitution’s right-to-know provisions. In the state, judges have discretion to award attorneys fees when private groups or individuals are successful in vindicating constitutional rights, like obtaining public documents.
Previously, the Montana State Supreme Court had been reluctant to recommend a checklist of conditions that have to be met in order to award attorneys fees, instead relying on the judgment of district or trial court judges. However, a majority of the court decided to take up the issue, saying that more guidance was necessary for judges, something a minority, including Chief Justice Cory Swanson, balked at. The dissenting opinions centered on the idea that judges should still have latitude to decide on a case-by-case basis, and that if the Legislature wanted to mandate attorneys fees, it should be done in law.
Justice Laurie McKinnon wrote the majority opinion, with James Jeremiah Shea, Katherine Bidegaray and Ingrid Gustafson concurring. Justices Jim Rice and Beth Baker, along with Swanson were in the minority.
The majority pointed out in the case that the governor’s office had employed a “novel” legal theory that Abbott debunked, but even so, “the court found the governor’s office shirked its clear legal duty to MEIC’s request.”
“When a party succeeds in litigation based on a right to know request, it has performed a public service in ensuring that Montana’s government is appropriately transparent and accountable to the people,” the majority opinion said.
The justices reasoned that if constitutionally protected rights are meaningful, then litigation — or the ability to take the government to court — must be accessible.
“The result of the district court’s order — that MEIC prevailed and undeniably performed a public service, yet it is denied attorney’s fees — is dissonant with the foundational purposes of Article II, Section 9, and actively disincentivizes citizens from enforcing that right,” the majority opinion said. “For citizens to be able to enforce the provision against the government, litigation must be accessible; for litigation to be accessible, there should be a basic presumption towards awarding attorney’s fees when the party seeking to enforce the right to know has prevailed on its merits.”
The majority shifted the blame back to the Montana Supreme Court, saying the state’s provisions for awarding attorneys fees had created a “vacuum of necessary guidance,” and the majority wanted to more fully develop the advice.
Abbott had determined that because Gianforte had not acted in bad faith, and because attorneys fees would essentially be borne by Montana taxpayers, he decided not to award attorneys fees.
However, the court said the calculus Abbott used — whether there was evidence of bad faith — shouldn’t be the deciding factor in the right-to-know cases.
“When a plaintiff prevails on the merits of a right to know dispute, it means that, whether in good faith or bad faith, the government pushed back against the constitutional presumption and, in doing so, violated a fundamental right,” the opinion said. “But because we have previously neglected to suggest a presumption — or even a preference — for awarding fees in this context, even plaintiffs with an exceptionally strong case and an egregious violation must carefully consider whether it is worth the risk of winning the documents but losing fees.”
The court’s opinion also said it was taking up the matter because it’s essential for courts and citizens to understand fundamental or Constitutional rights.
“We seek to provide basic guidance that works to encourage and strengthen the people’s exercise of a fundamental constitutional right. This presumption does not eliminate judicial discretion, but rather structures it to reflect the constitutional emphasis on transparency,” the ruling said. “This presumption is not a novelty imagined at the whims of this court; it is part of the fabric of the right to know which has been errantly lost to an unboundedly deferential standard that allows for results fundamentally at odds with the Constitution.”
Leaders from both Earthworks and MEIC cheered the decision, saying the decision was a win for residents who want to keep tabs on government officials.
“Montana’s Constitution guarantees the public the right to know what government is up to. Justice only works when every person has the ability to oversee their government,” said Anne Hedges, executive director with MEIC. “This decision will ensure the public can continue to access government documents and will prevent abuse when the government officials refuse to comply with the constitution.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota colleges are being advised to assess their risk and campus policies as the number of measles cases continues to grow in the state. 
Burke County on Thursday became the fourth North Dakota county with a confirmed measles case, the state Department of Health and Human Services reported. 
Grand Forks County reported another measles case Friday, bringing the state total to 29 cases, the most for the potentially fatal disease since 1978. 
The health department, on its measles information website, added two additional exposure locations in Crosby in Divide County, which neighbors Burke County.
The State Board of Higher Education on Thursday discussed the measles outbreak as campuses prepare to host summer youth camps and tours for prospective students. 
“Campuses have expressed concerns about camps that they run in the summer,” Vice Chancellor Lisa Johnson said in an update for the board. She noted that many campuses also are home to a child care facility.  
As states loosen childhood vaccine requirements, health experts’ worries grow

Only four of the 29 people in North Dakota who have contracted measles since May 2 are over age 19, according to the state health agency. Williams County was the first to report a measles case, followed by Cass and Grand Forks. All 29 people were unvaccinated, according to state officials. Two hospitalizations have now been reported, one in Cass and the other in Grand Forks County. 
Johnson encouraged the 11 schools in the North Dakota University System to assess how many unvaccinated people are on campuses and consider being proactive.
“One thing that we can do as campuses … is reach out to your local health providers, health department and doing some sort of vaccine clinic,” Johnson said. 
Johnson encouraged campuses to get a handle on who is and is not vaccinated through voluntary self-reporting. 
If there are students in campus housing and on meal plans who are required to self-isolate because of a measles exposure, colleges will need to have a plan for providing meals and other accommodations. 
She said that exemptions from vaccination requirements have become easier to obtain in recent years. She said she recognized that campuses are probably not eager to mandate vaccinations and then have to deal with exemption requests. 
Board member Casey Ryan of Grand Forks is a retired doctor. He noted the long incubation time of the measles virus, allowing people who don’t realize they are infected to spread the disease. 
“You really have to push the vaccination,” Ryan said. “I understand it’s a personal choice.”
Interim Chancellor Brent Sanford said the good news is that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is effective and readily available and that vaccination rate among adults in most areas of the state is high.

(Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest public utility, tried to stop an energy engineer who planned to testify about climate change from participating in a rate case as an expert witness.
It also attempted to curtail testimony based on an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.
The monopoly utility argued some of the testimony was an attempt to introduce “inadmissible hearsay and exhibits,” such as the IPCC report.
The IPCC is an international United Nations body set up to assess science related to climate with 195 members.
The utility also said the energy engineer sought to offer “improper legal opinions as a nonlawyer” and requested the Montana Public Service Commission strike that testimony.
On a 3-2 vote Tuesday, the Montana Public Service Commission supported a staff recommendation to allow the engineer, with the Montana Environmental Information Center, to testify as an expert witness.
But the PSC agreed he could not offer legal conclusions, as also recommended in the draft order from staff.
A minority on the commission tried to block expert testimony from the witness.
The order to allow the engineer to testify as an expert happened when PSC President Brad Molnar urged the commission to avoid a double standard and treat the witness fairly.
The PSC is all Republican, and Molnar said if the commission determined the MEIC witness wasn’t an expert, a future commission with a different political makeup could use the same rationale to disqualify witnesses for NorthWestern Energy.
He also said the commission will have the ability to test the engineer’s testimony.
“If there is one golden nugget in there, either substantiated by cross examination or refuted by cross examination, it has been worthy of our time,” Molnar said.
Molnar also said the argument to silence the engineer was not based in fact.
“What we have is a desire to stop one person from testifying because one other moving party (NorthWestern) in this soon-to-be drama doesn’t want people to hear what he has to say,” Molnar said. “And I can’t go with that.”
The dispute is one small debate in another rate case filed by NorthWestern Energy and already drawing scrutiny after a 2023 settlement the PSC approved that hiked electric bills nearly 28%.
Montanans have been fighting about the effects of climate change in different political arenas, including at the utility regulatory agency.
The witness whom NorthWestern tried to block, Nick Fitzmaurice of the Montana Environmental Information Center, said in written pre-filed testimony the utility has “neglected to account” for risks that climate change poses to its operations and credit.
“Corporate analysts have specifically and repeatedly noted that ‘climate change’ creates multiple risks for NorthWestern Energy,” Fitzmaurice said in part of his testimony. “Moody’s identified climate change as posing multiple risks to NorthWestern Energy.”
Attempts to cull and curate witness testimony in cases aren’t new, but the debate this week shows the pending rate case as another battleground over the role played by climate change in energy costs.
In an email to the Daily Montanan, NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the utility was not attempting to disallow information in the case.
“This motion was made not to limit an issue or topic but to ensure the professional standards for qualification as an expert witness were upheld,” Black said. “NorthWestern did not have any issues with this witness testifying as a lay or fact witness.”
However, Anne Hedges, with the Montana Environmental Information Center, said NorthWestern admits it doesn’t employ any scientific expert on climate change itself.
Hedges said it’s disingenuous for the utility to try to bill customers for climate impacts such as wildfire yet try to stifle the person giving testimony about climate change.
“Not having testimony means the commission can’t consider climate change at all, and that is exactly what they want,” Hedges said of NorthWestern. “So good for Brad Molnar. Good for the commission.”
In its motion, NorthWestern called on the PSC to strike “irrelevant evidence” from Fitzmaurice, energy transition engineer for the MEIC.
Fitzmaurice holds a bachelor’s degree in industrial management systems engineering from Montana State University and has worked in energy policy and modeling, according to his MEIC biography.
The utility tried to exclude his statements about its emissions and the economic impacts of climate change in Montana, and it tried to exclude testimony from Kyle Unruh of Renewable Northwest.
NorthWestern also disputed Fitzmaurice as an expert witness — experts are allowed to rely on reports, or “hearsay” not personally experienced, to explain their opinions.
NorthWestern, though, said Fitzmaurice should only be allowed to testify as a “lay witness” — meaning he could testify only from personal experience, which would exclude testimony based on an IPCC report.
Witnesses in rate cases file written testimony in advance of hearings.
At the meeting this week, PSC legal counsel Lucas Hamilton said staff found some of the testimony Fitzmaurice provided to be “impermissible legal conclusions” more appropriately submitted later on in the case.
However, Hamilton said staff recommended finding Fitzmaurice’s testimony relevant, contrary to NorthWestern’s motion, although he said its credibility would be up to the commission to determine.
Before the PSC approved the recommended order from staff, Commissioner Annie Bukacek moved to disqualify Fitzmaurice, with support from Commissioner Jennifer Fielder.
Bukacek said Fitzmaurice “has not done enough actual work” in his field, and she had yet to meet an “expert in climatology or energy policy” who didn’t have a doctorate degree.
“Standards matter in any field that provides critical information, such as energy policy,” Bukacek said.
In response to a question, however, Hamilton said without a point of reference from the parties, the standard for qualifying a person as “an expert” within the field of energy policy is discretionary.
In the meantime, he said, the Montana rules of evidence call for a liberal interpretation of who is an expert — and allow an expert’s testimony to be scrutinized.
PSC staff attorney Amanda Webster said if the PSC deemed Fitzmaurice a “lay witness” as opposed to an expert, it would “effectively preclude him” from testifying altogether.
“There wouldn’t be much left of his testimony,” Webster said.
The move to oust Fitzmaurice from the list of experts failed, with only Bukacek and Fielder in support. Commissioners Randy Pinocci and Jeff Welborn supported Molnar’s move to adopt the draft order prepared by staff.
Pinocci said he didn’t want a disqualification by the PSC to lead to a costly lawsuit alleging the commission had drawn an improper conclusion about an expert.
Unruh, with Renewable NorthWest, declined to comment beyond his written testimony. The order from the PSC denied NorthWestern’s move to strike his remarks.
Relying in part on an IPCC report, Unruh argues NorthWestern is putting Montana ratepayers at “substantial economic risk” and “regulatory risk” by ignoring the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.
But Hedges, with the MEIC, said NorthWestern Energy has become more bullish, and the rate case is demonstrating “their new aggressive position toward the commission and toward customers.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Methane-Plant2.int_-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

With a narrow balance of power in the U.S. Senate, if U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan has the courage to work with Sen. Lisa  Murkowski, he can help stop this unprecedented attack on health care and core Medicaid services. President Donald Trump and Republicans are trying to cancel Alaskans’ Medicaid health coverage to finance tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy, and those elitists will succeed if our senators don’t fight back.
Alaska has one of, if not the highest rates of suicide, child abuse, domestic abuse, and sexual assault in the nation. Many of the victims utilize services that are funded by Medicaid. This may include individualized therapy and family therapy, intensive behavioral support in community and school settings, case management that secures outside resources for families in need such as food stamps, housing, therapeutic foster care placements, and reunification with families or adoption. Without access to these services, Alaska’s suicide rates could climb, crime rates could increase, and more children could enter foster care without the supportive treatment they need to navigate their trauma. 
As a frontline mental and behavioral health worker, I worry for the youth I serve and how lack of available services and strained capacity will impact their growth. I worry that in the future, I may see youth that I have served living on the streets, turn to drugs to cope, or succumb to suicide. This month, Anchorage lost the Crisis Recovery Center that provided emergency care to teens experiencing mental health crises. Can we really afford to lose anything more? 
Our senators have the chance to ensure the youth of Alaska have a safe and stable future. Based on public statements, U.S. Republican Senators Murkowski, Lisa Collins of Maine, and Josh Hawley of Missouri all oppose cuts to Medicaid. Sullivan could be a deciding vote.

(Photo courtesy of VisitGreenvilleSC)When President Trump’s top trade adviser attacked BMW in Greer, the local reaction was swift and fierce.
“He’s divorced from reality,” said Spartanburg County Council Vice Chair David Britt, speaking of that top official, Peter Navarro. “He has a twisted view of the United States. He lives in the ‘70s.”
Ouch. But there’s more: “This is why you don’t let people and passengers on a plane fly it,” Britt added.
In other words, Britt was inviting Navarro, architect of Trump’s controversial tariff policies, to kindly butt out of the Upstate’s business.
In ruby red South Carolina, that’s some tough talk directed at Trump’s influential trade adviser.
What prompted the strong reaction from Britt and Upstate business leaders was Navarro blasting BWM and Mercedes for importing car parts to make finished vehicles in South Carolina.
“This business model where BMW and Mercedes come into Spartanburg, South Carolina, and have us assemble German engines and Austrian transmissions — that doesn’t work for America. It’s bad for our economics. It’s bad for our national security,” Navarro said.
Navarro was referring to BMW’s sprawling manufacturing facility known as Plant Spartanburg. But he got the Mercedes plant location wrong. It’s near Charleston, not Spartanburg.
Navarro believes Trump’s tariffs will force auto companies to manufacture all car parts, “from bolt to body,” here in the U.S.
“Peter Navarro is out of touch,” Britt said. “He needs to visit Plant Spartanburg with BMW if he really wants to see what’s going on. My blood boils when this sort of thing happens.”
Tariffs raise costs
The strong reaction by Britt and Upstate business leaders was really not surprising.
The not-so-secret reality of the Upstate economy is that it’s driven by massive foreign investment and strong international imports and exports.
The globalization goose lays the golden eggs. Or call it a Carolina wren.
The Upstate economy is internationally connected. Tariffs raise costs, obstructing the smooth and successful operation of South Carolina’s top manufacturers. Those higher costs are passed on to the American consumer in the form of higher prices.
In the Lowcountry, meanwhile, David Wren reports in the SC Daily Gazette that Volvo Cars has halted production at its Ridgefield plant because of a parts shortage caused at least in part by Trump’s fluctuating tariffs.
Trump, it seems, is a president who likes walls, whether on the southern border or in the form of trade barriers like tariffs.
The average U.S. tariff rate is 17.8%, more than seven times the 2.5% Trump inherited, the Financial Times recently reported.
But the Upstate’s iconic symbol is not a wall but a bridge. Aptly named “Liberty Bridge,” the expansive footbridge towers over the beautiful Reedy River Falls near downtown Greenville.
The modern miracle of Greenville — and if you’ve been around at least three decades or so, you know what a miracle it is — is built on trade freedom, not on trade war.
Washington speaks of economic adversaries. The Upstate seeks out economic partners.
With classic Southern hospitality, the Upstate has welcomed hundreds of international businesses such as Germany’s BMW (more than 11,000 workers), France’s Michelin (more than 9,000 workers), Sweden’s Eloctrolux, Switzerland’s Nestle, Japan’s Fujifilm, and Germany’s ZF, Bosch, Adidas, and Draexlmaier, just to name a few.
The Greenville Area Development Corporation points out that South Carolina as a whole frequently ranks as the No. 1 state for attracting jobs through foreign direct investment per capita.
More than 250 international firms from 28 countries have a major presence in the Upstate.
“We welcome this melting pot of residents and visitors with open arms,” the Greenville development corporation says.
‘Good for America’
In a joint statement, the Greenville Chamber of Commerce and OneSpartanburg rose to the defense of BMW, drawing attention to the Upstate’s diversified and globalized economy: “BMW Group’s Plant Spartanburg drove Upstate South Carolina’s transformation from a declining textile economy to a thriving center of advanced manufacturing.”
BMW packs an economic wallop, employing more than 11,000 workers and providing a $26.7-billion impact for South Carolina.
The plant is the largest exporter of vehicles by value in the U.S., shipping 225,000 vehicles worth more than $10 billion in 2024, Upstate business leaders said.
BMW has produced 5 million vehicles in Greer since the plant opened in 1994.
U.S. Rep. William Timmons, who represents Greenville and Spartanburg counties in Congress, and Gov. Henry McMaster also added their support for BMW’s policies.
“I can assure you that BMW is good for South Carolina and America,” Timmons said.
The SC Daily Gazette’s Jessica Holdman provided a detailed and in-depth report on how Trump’s tariffs could cause serious harm to South Carolina’s thriving auto industry.
Tariffs raise prices on imported car parts and potentially undermine car exports from South Carolina.
Trump has scaled back some of his disruptive auto tariffs, but not permanently.
Globalization doesn’t deserve all the credit for the Upstate’s bustling and ever-growing economy, but international investment and free trade have been an unambiguous godsend for the region and the entire state.
Upstate businesses will weather the storm, knowing that the nation eventually will return to its free-trade foundation.
After all, the Upstate’s defining symbol is a bridge, not a wall.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in federal court in that year, claiming Monroe County Sheriff Richard Ramsay unlawfully detained and nearly deported the U.S. citizen. 
U.S. Judge Kathleen Williams ruled in favor of Brown on summary judgement Friday on two counts: unconstitutional seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment and false imprisonment. 
According to court records, Brown, born in Philadelphia in 1968, turned himself in for a probation violation in 2018 after testing positive for marijuana. His fingerprints were submitted to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which identified him as having a final removal order and he was held by the county to be taken into federal custody. 
While in custody, Brown insisted to sheriff deputies that he was a citizen and offered a birth certificate. County officials did nothing to contest ICE’s claim that Brown was not a citizen, Williams wrote. 
“Mr. Brown repeatedly informed MCSO of his U.S. citizenship prior to the new arrest and offered documentation of his claims. The Court finds that this is the exact type of information that renders the earlier probable cause determination to be stale, requiring some sort of action on MCSO’s part to verify or inquire about ICE’s probable cause determination.”
The 2018 arrest was the second time Brown had been arrested after being suspected of not being a U.S. citizen. ICE had been looking for someone else named Peter Brown, with a different middle name. 
According to court findings, sheriff’s employees routinely accessed a database that identified Brown as a citizen, but did not pass that information on to ICE.

After Brown’s time in jail for the probation violation concluded, he was immediately re-arrested to be held for ICE and potential deportation to Jamaica. He was transported to Krome Detention Center in Miami. Once there, he told ICE agents he was a citizen. The agents checked his birth certificate and arranged for his release. 
Brown had called ICE multiple times from county jail, but was unable to get through.
“MCSO could have contacted ICE to investigate Mr. Brown’s claims of citizenship or, if unwilling to do that, released him based on their own records that dissipated probable cause. To hold otherwise would be to permit law enforcement agencies to use the collective knowledge doctrine as both a sword and a shield,” Williams wrote. 
That’s a principle that law officers can rely on information provided by other police agencies.
Oral arguments for the case were held on May 15, 2024. 
“We have seen the ICE detainer system fail time and again, but the County still chose to put Mr. Brown through this nightmare,” said Cody Wofsy, deputy project director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “At a moment in which we are seeing a raft of unlawful immigration arrests of citizens by federal and local authorities, this decision is a key reminder that the Fourth Amendment safeguards us all.”
In a 26-page partial summary judgement, Williams denied the sheriff’s motion to throw out Brown’s case.
“The Court is not ordering that MCSO cannot comply with ICE detainers and warrants. Instead, the Court’s holding today is simply that, when MCSO possesses information indicating that an individual in MCSO custody is a U.S. Citizen, MCSO cannot abdicate its legal responsibility and turn a blind eye to this information,” Williams wrote. 
“The Court merely holds that, MCSO cannot choose to do nothing as they did here.”

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)A battle for the open Senate District 4 seat is taking shape, with half a dozen candidates filing declaration papers with the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s office by Friday’s 4 p.m. deadline. The upcoming special election features four Democrats, one Republican and one independent candidate.
The upcoming Aug. 5 special election marks the first time the district spanning North Providence and the northern part of Providence will have a new state senator in over 40 years. Voters will choose the person who will fill the unexpired term of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, who died April 21, at age 76. Ruggerio was first elected to the Senate in 1984.
Each declared candidate still must secure 100 signatures from certified voters within the district to qualify for the ballot. The signature deadline is June 10.
The four Democratic candidates would first compete in a special primary on July 8. 
Among the Democratic contenders is former state representative Marcia Ranglin-Vassell of Providence. The 64-year-old Providence Public Schools teacher served three terms representing Rhode Island’s House District 6 before deciding not to run again in 2022.
In a May 2 Facebook post announcing her intent to run, Ranglin-Vassell touted a “proven track record of fighting and winning.” During her six years in the House, she championed progressive policies like a $15 minimum wage and gun control alongside education and equity initiatives.
Education reform was a top priority for fellow Democratic candidate Manny Taveras. Taveras, 40 of North Providence, also emphasized housing and small business services in his May 14 campaign announcement.
Manny Taveras is the younger brother of former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, who led the capital city from 2011 to 2015. The younger Taveras also worked for the Providence mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Services from 2008 to 2010, according to his LinkedIn page. He now works as an account executive for private pharmacy benefits manager MedImpact, according to his LinkedIn. This will be his first run for elected office.
Also in the running is Democratic North Providence Town Councilman Stefano Famiglietti. Famiglietti, 33, recently opened his own law practice in Providence focused on employment matters, and has served as a city councilor since 2018. In a May 20 campaign announcement, Famiglietti stressed municipal services and responsible budgeting as priorities if elected to the state Senate seat.
Rounding out the Democratic primary ballot is Lenny Cioe Jr., a nurse at Blackstone Valley Community Health who unsuccessfully challenged Ruggerio in the last three Democratic primaries. The 65-year-old North Providence progressive announced he was entering the race Friday afternoon, 30 minutes before the deadline to file paperwork with the Rhode Island Secretary of State.
Cioe in a statement said his campaign will focus on “local issues,” including “price gouging” by utility provider Rhode Island Energy, and protecting Medicaid and other health programs from federal funding cuts.
The lone Republican, Alexander Asermely, also waited until the final day to formally enter the race. He said in a statement he felt it was time to “step up and use my voice,” lamenting economic, educational and infrastructure shortcomings across the state and within the district.
The 39-year-old father and lifelong North Providence resident works as an attorney for Bellotti Law Group in Boston, according to his LinkedIn page. Asermely is also a political newcomer, having never run for office before.
Asermely does not have any primary opponents, putting him on the path to the August special election as long as he submits the requisite voter signatures.
Also bound for the general election ballot: independent candidate Stephen G. Tocco. The North Providence resident and retired chief of Rhode Island Capitol Police served on the Smithfield Town Council from 2004 to 2007. He also ran multiple unsuccessful campaigns for state Senate, including against Ruggerio in a three-way Democratic primary in 2022. All but one of his prior candidacies for office have been as a Democrat; in 2020, he ran as an independent candidate for the Senate District 22 seat, which spans parts of Smithfield, North Providence and Lincoln.
While the seat was held by a Democrat for the last 40 years, the district is nearly evenly split between registered Democrats and independents, who comprise 45% and 44%, respectively, of its 22,300 registered voters as of May, according to data with the Rhode Island Department of State. The remaining 11% of voters are registered Republicans.
Voters have until June 8 to register, or disaffiliate, ahead of the July 8 primary election. Early voting is set to begin June 18, running through July 7.
The winner of the election will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026. 
State lawmakers are paid $19,817 a year.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)For the seventh time, Gov. Tony Evers ordered the Progress Pride Flag to fly over the Wisconsin State Capitol for LGBTQ Pride Month. 
This year, Pride Month begins on the 10th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which gave same-sex couples the right to get married in 2015. But Evers’ celebration of LGBTQ pride is occuring as the administration of President Donald Trump attacks the rights of transgender people and a recent Gallup poll found that Republican acceptance of same-sex marriage has fallen to its lowest level in nine years. 
“When the Pride Flag flies above the People’s House, it sends a clear and unequivocal message that Wisconsin recognizes and celebrates LGBTQ Wisconsinites and Americans,” Evers said in a statement. “Every day, but especially today and this month, we reaffirm our commitment to striving to be a place where every LGBTQ kid, person, and family can be bold in their truth and be safe, treated with dignity and respect, and welcomed without fear of persecution, judgment, or discrimination. I promised long ago that, as governor, I would always fight to protect LGBTQ Wisconsinites with every tool and every power that I have. I will never stop keeping that promise.”
In the executive order Evers signed Friday, he notes that the LGBTQ has been under attack in recent years, including in Wisconsin where Republicans have tried more than once to pass legislation attacking transgender children.
“Despite historic victories, in the last several years, there has been a significant increase in anti-LGBTQ legislation introduced in state Legislatures across the country, including in Wisconsin, that have targeted LGBTQ kids and people and increased dangerous anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, as well as efforts on a state and national level to erase LGBTQ history and stories.” 
The Progress Pride Flag flying above the Capitol includes the recognizable LGBTQ rainbow colors and a chevron of additional stripes that represent LGBTQ people of color, the transgender community and people with HIV/AIDS.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Job Corps centers in Albany and Brunswick are set to shut their doors by June 30 after the U.S. Department of Labor announced plans to suspend operations at nearly 100 locations nationwide.
The Job Corps program dates back to 1964 and was created as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty.” The program, which claims to be “the largest nationwide residential career training program in the country,” works by providing low-income students ages 16 to 24 with housing, education, career training and employment assistance, primarily in industries like manufacturing, construction and health care. 
However, the program encountered serious hurdles during the COVID-19 pandemic, and currently faces a $140 million budget deficit that Department of Labor officials estimate could grow to $213 million by next year. The federal agency cited a report from April highlighting metrics like the average annual cost per student, average total costs per graduate and total violent crime rates.
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training, and community,” U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve.”
In total, 99 centers that are run by contract agencies will be forced to close should the plan take effect. An additional 24 centers owned and operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture will not be affected by the closures. Atlanta is home to the program’s Region 3 office, overseeing centers across Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. 
The Department of Labor said it plans to arrange transportation back home for roughly 25,000 currently enrolled students, and to connect them with other educational and employment resources. It is unclear how many students across Georgia will be affected. Calls to the Atlanta-based Jobs Corps office were not answered and emails sent to two top officials received a bounce back message.
Lawmakers in Congress were quick to push back against the sudden closures, citing a long history of bipartisan support for the program.
“The Job Corps program is the embodiment of a hand up and not a handout,” said U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, an Albany Democrat who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Job Corps Caucus. “It provides workforce skills and training that empower participants to become self-sufficient and productive citizens. Today’s foolish action by the White House and the United States Department of Labor to close the Job Corps program will shatter the dreams and aspirations of tens of thousands of promising students.”
Critics of the closures, including the National Job Corps Association, have also argued that the data used to compile the report is misleading, since it focuses solely on metrics from 2023, a year when the program was still struggling to recover from pandemic-era hurdles that lowered enrollment and graduation numbers.
Notably, this is not the first time President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted the Job Corps program for closures. Sonny Purdue, the former Georgia governor who later served as Agriculture Secretary in the first Trump Administration and is now the chancellor of the Georgia Board of Regents, also attempted to shutter nine Job Corps centers and transfer an additional 16 centers to private contractors back in 2019. However, he quickly dropped the bid after encountering fierce congressional pushback — including from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Sabrina Cervantes maintained from the start that she wasn’t drunk or on drugs after she was cited for DUI.,"In summary
California Sen. Sabrina Cervantes maintained from the start that she wasn’t drunk or on drugs after she was cited for DUI. 


Prosecutors will not file DUI charges against California Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, after a blood test showed she had “no measurable amount of drugs or alcohol in her system” following a crash last week in Sacramento a few blocks from the Capitol.
“We have reviewed all the submitted evidence, including police reports, witness statements, and laboratory results. Based on our ethical duty and the burden of proof in a criminal trial, the Sacramento County DA’s Office declines to file any charges in this case,” Shelly Orio, a spokeswoman for the Sacramento District Attorney’s Office, said in an email.
The announcement is a vindication for Cervantes, a 37-year-old Democrat from the Riverside area. She maintained from the start that she wasn’t impaired and that Sacramento police officers “accosted” her at a hospital where they detained her for several hours. 
Cervantes did not immediately respond to a request for comment today.
The Sacramento Police Department responded with an emailed statement in response to a CalMatters interview request.  
“During their interaction with Sen. Cervantes, they observed objective signs that led them to believe she may have been impaired while operating a motor vehicle,” police said. “The officers remained professional throughout, taking time to explain the process and answer all of the senator’s questions.”Officers said Cervantes initially declined to participate with officers’ sobriety tests. So they asked a judge for a warrant for Cervantes to submit to a blood test and told Cervantes they had requested one.
“While the warrant was being written and processed, the senator agreed to voluntarily provide a blood sample, however, since the warrant process was already underway officers waited until it was signed by a judge before proceeding with the blood draw, which was conducted by a licensed phlebotomist,” police said. 
The May 19 crash happened around 1 p.m., less than an hour before she was supposed to be on the floor of the state Legislature.
Last week, CalMatters reviewed footage from a nearby office building’s security camera that appears to show Cervantes wasn’t at fault in the crash.
The footage shows a white SUV rolling through a stop sign and careening into Cervantes’ black sedan at the intersection of 14th and S streets in midtown Sacramento. Cervantes appeared to have had the right-of-way as she drove east on S Street.
Sacramento police said the other driver was cited for failing to stop at a stop sign. Last week, CalMatters filed a public records request seeking body camera footage and police reports.
In the statement, police said they will release some documents later Friday and are still processing others.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/042423-Assembly-Floor-0424-MG-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

DemasA federal judge on Thursday said the director of the Michigan Department of Corrections and other defendants did not meet their burden of proof when they alleged that the plaintiffs in an ongoing dangerous conditions lawsuit did not exhaust their administrative remedies before going to court.
It was yet another win for the plaintiffs in Bailey v. Washington, which has been gestating in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan since 2019.
In an order released Thursday by U.S. District Judge Stephen Murphy of the Eastern District of Michigan, the court found significant flaws with the department’s grievance process. MDOC Director Heidi Washington and other department defendants said that the plaintiffs failed to use that process to its fullest extent before filing a lawsuit, but Murphy noted that the flaws in the system prevented the plaintiffs’ grievances from being heard by the department.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“By detailing the consequences of the inadequate ventilation in their grievances, the plaintiffs gave MDOC ‘a fair opportunity to address [the] claims on the merits before federal litigation was commenced,’” Murphy wrote.
Washington and the department defendants moved twice for summary judgment in the case but were denied. After the defendants moved for an evidentiary hearing to resolve factual issues, the matter was moved to a magistrate, who found Washington and department officials failed to meet their burden of proof in showing that plaintiff Paula Bailey and others did not do everything they could to raise concerns over the prison’s declining conditions.
Washington and the defendants challenged the magistrate’s findings, specifically objecting to the assertion that the grievances related to ventilation in the prison had sufficiently put the department on notice. 
Murphy on Thursday said at least two relevant grievances shared in the evidentiary hearing had effectively put the department on notice. 
Murphy also noted that the department had repeatedly rejected grievances as untimely despite circumstances beyond the control of inmates.
bailey-order-overruling-226-objections-and-ado
Washington and the defendants had challenged that portion as going outside the scope of the court’s referral on the factual matters in question, but Murphy said the mail system used by Corrections and its inherent delays were a large part of why the grievances were deemed untimely.
“Faced with this and other issues, the Report found that the grievance policy was unavailable to the plaintiffs Bailey, Clark, and Zentz,” Murphy wrote. “In doing so, the report commented on the prison mailbox rule. The report’s findings, and the way in which [U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Stafford] explained her findings, may have an impact on future cases. But the court will not hold off on adopting the two pages just because they may have consequences in other cases. The objection is overruled.”
The lawsuit alleges that the department maintained poor conditions at the Huron Valley Women’s Correctional Facility, which later led to the presence of toxic mold. The case was initially dismissed along with Pearson v. Corrections, but was later revived by the courts on an amended complaint.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_2381-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-30 16:07:04.220283

“Luther’s reputation as a selective liberal arts college that is known for its involved students, committed faculty and staff, and a strong sense of community inspired me to apply, and I am delighted to accept President Chamberlain’s offer,” Bacon said in the release. “Given my experience at a faith-based residential liberal arts college and my own life-changing experiences attending a residential liberal arts college, I am excited to engage with the challenges and opportunities that are ahead for Luther College.”
Bacon previously served as faculty and administrator for the College of Saint Benedict, a women’s college, and Saint John’s University, a men’s college, as the institutions share curriculum, faculty and leadership. There she worked to oversee academic affairs and the colleges’ division of student success, according to the release, among other duties.
Once at Luther College, Bacon will oversee a combined department of academic affairs and student success and engagement, the release stated. The college brought academic and student affairs together into one program in 2021, Chamberlain said in the release, and its more holistic methods of serving students have seen success. Bacon said in the release she’s ready to work with the Luther community to “ensure that students receive a holistic, immersive experience that is both academically enriching and personally transformative.”
Chamberlain said he is excited to work with Bacon and see her “impact on improving the experiences of students, faculty and staff” at the college.
“Dr. Bacon brings to Luther College a passion for supporting the holistic development that students should experience, inside and outside of the classroom, at residential, liberal arts colleges,” Chamberlain said. “Informed by her academic training as a social psychologist and her progressive experience as an academic administrator, Dr. Bacon’s empathetic, relational and collaborative approach emphasizes engaging stakeholders, considering alternative perspectives, and using data to inform decision-making processes.”

A campaign website and social media account for Sen. David Yates, the Democratic Whip from Louisville, were updated Friday to reflect his plans to run for Jefferson County clerk next year. His website now has a campaign kick-off scheduled for Monday, June 9, with appearances by Louisville area Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey and former U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth. 
Yates’ updated website comes on the heels of another Democratic senator leaving the caucus. Sen. Robin Webb, of Grayson, changed her party affiliation Friday to join the Republican Party. 
Bobbie Holsclaw, the Jefferson County clerk since 1998, is an elected Republican in Louisville, a Kentucky city where voters tend to favor Democrats. She faced some criticism after the November election following an issue with e-poll books that delayed lines early in the day. Democrats sued to keep the polls open longer in the day, but a Jefferson Circuit judge denied their emergency request. 
Yates’ campaign did not immediately return an emailed request for comment. 
An attorney, Yates was elected to the Senate in 2020. He won reelection in November for the 37th Senate District, taking more than 60% of the vote in the general election.

Unlike criminal bonds, bond seekers only have to post 10% of the bond cost, which many families can’t afford.","Activists protest the agenda of President  Donald Trump during a rally near the water tower on the Magnificent Mile on Jan. 25, 2025, in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)In his six years helping run the Casa San José Bail Fund, Guillermo Perez says lately, he has been attending more ICE bail hearings and helping getting more undocumented immigrants out of detention than ever. 
“People are scared right now, immigrants are being attacked like never before,” said Perez, an immigration activist and retired Steelworkers union organizer. 
In late April, ICE raided a popular Mexican restaurant in Beaver County, 1942 Tequilas and Tacos. Eight employees were detained, one of several that activists say have been happening in Pittsburgh at laundromats, apartment buildings, and even school bus stops. The latest raids in the region were in Braddock and Wilkinsburg in the final days of May. 
For activists like Perez, each raid put them into a scramble to figure out how they could assist immigrants and their families affected. One way is through the Casa San José Bail Fund, which he helped found.
The fund is helping to ease fears by getting immigrants out of detention and giving them legal resources to fight deportations. Founded during the first Trump Administration in 2019, the Casa San José Bail Fund has raised more than $200,000 from people in the Pittsburgh area. Unlike criminal bonds, bond seekers only have to post 10% of the bond cost, which many families can’t afford. 
Since its inception, it’s made 61 loans to various families and helped protect dozens of families from deportation. 
Across Pennsylvania, two other ICE bail funds have emerged to help immigrants in detention.
In Lancaster, where 42% of the population is Latino according to the U.S. Census Bureau the Parish Resource Center maintains the Immigration Bond and Advocacy Network. In Philadelphia, the New Sanctuary Movement maintains the Community Fund for Bond and Legal Support.
Unlike the Casa San José ICE bail fund, which raises all of its money locally, both funds are part of the National Bail Fund Network. The network also helps in providing bail funds for American citizens jailed on criminal charges. 
“They connect different bond funds,” says Peter Pedemonti of the New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia. “So if we might not have all the money, we could connect with a fund in Massachusetts or somewhere else to pull money together.”

Pedemonti says that there is a growing nationwide movement aimed at getting more immigrants out of ICE detention. 
“At a time where there’s been a daily assault on immigrant families, both on the ground with ICE agents and also from the White House with policy coming out. I think it is, it is really important to have that, like that concrete small action and that concrete action of liberation,,” says Pedemonti. “It’s a small victory for one family.”
Studies have shown that immigrants who can get out of immigration detention are far less likely to be deported. Some fleeing violence can seek asylum and other venues to achieve legal status successfully. The process can often take years, but some immigrants have found legal ways to stay in the United States. 
However, those who stay in detention are sometimes subject to isolation and conditions, which advocates have often described as inhuman and unsanitary. 
“What they do is they put tremendous pressure on people to just go ahead and sign away their rights to due process,” said Perez. “They just use incarceration as a way of pressuring people to self-deport”.

The fund works with a network of immigration attorneys to review the circumstances of each case and assess the likelihood that a bond could be successful. 
“If we assess that they do have a possible path for why they should be allowed to legally stay in the United States, then we go ahead and try to get them legal representation so that they can see if they’re eligible to get a bond,” said Perez. 
Unlike traditional bail funds, Casa San José does not charge interest and allows families to repay the bail over the years. The funds are then reused to help other immigrants get bail. 
Perez says it has helped mobilize immigrants around Pittsburgh to become politically active in groups like Casa San José. 
“Rather than just handing somebody money and wishing them best of luck, we want them to continue to be involved (with) Casa San José, to be involved in helping other people in the community who are being impacted by deportations as well,” said Perez. “So the goal of the bond fund is not only obviously (to) get people out of detention, but also to try to convey that the community is stronger when we support each other”. 
Some donors  sign up to give the fund $20 a month, but the bulk of the money comes from several large fundraisers.  A variety of community groups in Pittsburgh are holding these types of events to support its efforts. 
In late March, Temple Sinai was packed with over 100 Jewish activists who showed up for the “De-ICE Ball.” 
“There’s nothing like when the Jewish community shows up. You guys are no joke,” said Monica Ruiz, the director of Casa San José, to a clapping crowd of Jewish activists.
The event raised more than $18,000.
“I’m shocked at how many people showed up,” said Harry Hochheiser, one of the organizers.
Hochheiser is a member of the Dor Hadash Synagogue. In 2018, one of their congregation’s members, Dr. Jerry Rabonwitz, was killed when a shooter killed 11 Jews who attended three different congregations located in the Tree of Life Synagogue complex, just a few blocks from Temple Sinai. The Oct. 27, 2018, attack is the deadliest attack against Jews in American history. 
The shooter said that he murdered them because their congregations were fundraising to help immigrants through the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.
“I think to some extent, that’s faded from people’s memories a little bit, even here, but it’s definitely in the back of my mind,” Hochheiser said. 
Hochheiser said Jews, though, are largely motivated to help immigrants due to their own history of persecution. 
He pointed out the fundraiser was taking place right around the 86th anniversary of the United States turning away the SS St. Louis, which was carrying over 900 Jewish refugees fleeing Hitler. They were denied entry to the United States and 254 of the passengers would later be killed in the Holocaust when they were returned to Europe. 
“It’s knowing your history, and it’s looking back to think, ‘Hey, you know what, what was it like for my grandparents,'” he said. “I can’t imagine being turned back or turned away.” 
At a time when many activists say that they feel helpless in stopping the Trump administration’s deportation efforts, organizers say giving to the Casa San José Bail fund gives them a tangible way to help people. 
“I think particularly at this moment, there are a lot of people who are just looking to do something,” said Hochheiser.

(Photo by John McAnulty/Getty Images)The Mount St. Helens visitor center is reopening its doors with the first major renovations since it opened in 1986.
Starting on May 31, the center will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Prior to the renovation, exhibits remained largely unchanged since they were first installed nearly four decades ago, and only six years after the volcano erupted. The center closed Sept. 30, 2024, and work began on upgrades with funding from the state.
The $1.1 million renovation will be centered around the Cowlitz Indian Tribe and the 1980 eruption and will feature more tactile, sensory, interactive exhibits tailored to kids and families.
Mount St. Helens is famous for its massive eruption on May 18, 1980, which killed 57 people, blasted away part of the mountain, and spewed about 540 million tons of ash.
The mountain has played a central role in the customs and culture of the Cowlitz Tribe and other Indigenous people across this region. Washington State Parks worked closely with the tribe to highlight its culture and traditions and provide visitors a holistic understanding of the mountain and the tribe’s perspective.
New exhibits include contemporary and historic works by Cowlitz artists and in the Cowlitz language. One of the exhibits includes a new film of a Cowlitz spiritual leader, Tanna Engdahl. Additionally, there are several short films that highlight the tribe’s use of natural resources.
Since the eruption, the mountain’s landscape has undergone significant changes. Scientists have since deepened their understanding of both the eruption and ongoing volcanic activity within the mountain, said Sarah Fronk, a spokesperson for Washington State Parks.
“The exhibits have been updated to reflect current science and to provide a broader story about the mountain’s long history of eruptions,” she added.
Visitors can expect an enhanced experience with hands-on learning through interactive displays and storytelling, along with improvements to the reception desk design and the flow of the building. Accessibility improvements have also been made inside and outside the building.
Some of the new offerings include a “Make-a-Quake” exhibit that lets you create your own shockwaves with a seismograph, a new and improved “walk-in” volcano that takes you inside a replica of the mountain, and a “Volcano Blasters” pinball machine.
There are also over 80 historic artifacts, volcanic rocks, a wetland exploration area, and a three-dimensional relief map of the mountain.
A new “Junior Volcano Explorer” activity booklet and badge program is also offered to kids.
Admission for children under 7 is free. The cost is $2.50 for youth ages 7 to 17 and $5 for adults.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mount-st.-helens-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-05-30 16:07:04.220283

Turtle Mountain, Spirit Lake Nation and three tribal citizens are challenging a ruling in a voting rights case. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation and three tribal citizens this week asked the full 8th Circuit Court of Appeals to review a three-judge panel’s finding that they lack standing to bring a voting discrimination case against the state of North Dakota.
In a 2-1 decision earlier this month, the panel overruled a North Dakota federal district court’s decision that a redistricting plan adopted by the state in 2021 diluted the voting power of Native voters.
“Turtle Mountain fought hard for a fair and legal map. When the state draws unlawful districts, Courts must step in to protect voters — not pave the way for injustice,” Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chairman Jamie Azure said in a statement published by the Campaign Legal Center, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs in the suit. “We will continue to fight for fair representation.”
Appeals court rules against North Dakota tribes in voting rights case

The panel’s decision didn’t speak to whether the map itself was discriminatory; instead, the judges found that private individuals cannot use a key federal civil rights law as a vehicle to file cases under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws race-based voting discrimination.
The panel in its ruling sent the case back to North Dakota U.S. District Judge Peter Welte with instructions to dismiss the lawsuit. If its ruling stands, North Dakota would revert back to the 2021 map.
But if the plaintiffs’ request for an en banc rehearing is granted, the case would go before all 11 judges on the 8th Circuit for review.
“Section 2 is the foundational statute that Congress enacted to fight the scourge of racial discrimination in voting, but citizens in this circuit can no longer enforce the right it provides them,” the plaintiffs argue in a brief urging the full appellate court to consider the case.
Private individuals and groups previously could file discrimination lawsuits against governments under just Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act without having to invoke Section 1983, a separate civil rights statute.
Then, the 8th Circuit in a controversial 2023 ruling on an Arkansas voting rights case found that Section 2 alone doesn’t give private parties the right to sue. Instead, the circuit declared that it is the responsibility of the U.S. Attorney General to file Section 2 discrimination cases.
Tribes, state argue redistricting case to federal appeals court

For more than a year, the question remained open as to whether Section 1983 offered a viable alternative for bringing such Voting Rights Act claims. In a May 14 ruling, the three-judge panel decided it does not.
In a majority opinion, the panel wrote that the language of the Voting Rights Act indicates that Congress didn’t intend for citizens to file race discrimination claims through Section 1983.
The lone dissenting judge on the panel — Chief Judge Steven Colloton — noted in his opinion  that private plaintiffs have brought more than 400 actions under Section 2 since 1982.
The plaintiffs in their brief point out that the 8th Circuit is the only appellate circuit in the country to rule that Section 2 cannot be enforced through lawsuits brought by private citizens. The circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska and Arkansas.
“Outside of this circuit, every American citizen can rely on an unbroken line of Supreme Court and circuit precedent to enforce the individual rights given to them by Congress in the Voting Rights Act,” their filing states. “But as a result of the panel decision here, and the prior decision in Arkansas, American citizens in this circuit are denied that right.”
The lawsuit was triggered by a redistricting plan adopted by the North Dakota Legislature in 2021 that placed the Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake reservations in new districts.

U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2023 ruled that the new map was discriminatory and ordered the Legislature to implement a new map that placed the reservations in the same voting district.
Three Native American lawmakers from that district were elected in 2024: Sen. Richard Marcellais and Rep. Jayme Davis — both citizens of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa — and Rep. Collette Brown, a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation and plaintiff in the lawsuit.
“The fair map we secured led to a historic first — a Spirit Lake Nation member elected to the North Dakota Legislature,” Spirit Lake Nation Chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street said in a Wednesday statement published by the Campaign Legal Center, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs in the case. “This decision threatens that progress and weakens our voice in state government.”
Marcellais had previously served 15 years in the statehouse until he lost his bid for reelection in 2022. He was reelected in 2024. 
Davis was first elected in 2022, then reelected last year.
If the 2021 map is reinstated, three state lawmakers would move to different districts, according to the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office. Rep. Colette Brown, D-Warwick, would go from representing District 9 to District 15. Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, would switch from District 15 to District 9B, while Sen. Kent Weston, R-Sarles, would switch from District 15 to District 9. They would all have to seek reelection in 2026.

(Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)Despite years of patient complaints and quality-of-care concerns, Ballad Health — the nation’s largest state-sanctioned hospital monopoly — will now be held to a lower standard by the Tennessee government, and state data that holds the monopoly accountable will be kept from the public for two years.
Ballad is the only option for hospital care for most of the approximately 1.1 million people in a 29-county swath of Appalachia. Such a monopoly would normally be prohibited by federal law. But under deals negotiated with Tennessee and Virginia years ago, the monopoly is permitted if both states affirm each year that it is an overall benefit to the public.
However, according to a newly renegotiated agreement between Ballad and Tennessee, the monopoly can now be considered a “clear and convincing” benefit to the public with performance that would earn a “D” on most A-to-F grading scales.
And the monopoly can be allowed to continue even with a score that most would consider an “F.”
Six years into an Appalachia hospital monopoly, patients are fearful and furious

“It’s an extreme disservice to the people of northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia,” said Dani Cook, who has organized protests against Ballad’s monopoly for years. “We shouldn’t have lowered the bar. We should be raising the bar.”
The Ballad monopoly, which encompasses 20 hospitals and straddles the border of Tennessee and Virginia, was created in 2018 after lawmakers in both states, in an effort to prevent hospital closures, waived federal antitrust laws so two rival health systems could merge. Although Ballad has largely succeeded at keeping its hospitals open, staffing shortages and patient complaints have left some residents wary, afraid, or unwilling to seek care at Ballad hospitals, according to an investigation by KFF Health News published last year.
In Tennessee, the Ballad monopoly is regulated through a 10-year Certificate of Public Advantage agreement, or COPA — now in its seventh year — that establishes the state’s goals and a scoring rubric for hospital performance. Tennessee Department of Health documents show Ballad has fallen short of about three-fourths of the state’s quality-of-care goals over the past four fiscal years. But the monopoly has been allowed to continue, at least in part, because the scoring rubric doesn’t prioritize quality of care, according to the documents.
Angie Odom, a county commissioner in Tennessee’s Carter County, where leaders have clashed with Ballad, said she has driven her 12-year-old daughter more than 100 miles to Knoxville to avoid surgery at a Ballad hospital.
After years of disappointment in Tennessee’s oversight of the monopoly, Odom said she was “not surprised” by Ballad’s new grading scale.
“They’ve made a way that they can fail and still pass,” she said.
Virginia regulates Ballad with a different agreement and scoring method, and its reviews generally track about one or two years behind Tennessee’s. Both states have found Ballad to be an overall benefit in every year they’ve released a decision.
Neither Ballad Health nor the Tennessee Department of Health, which has the most direct oversight of the monopoly, answered questions submitted in writing about the renegotiated agreement. In an emailed statement, Molly Luton, a Ballad spokesperson, said the company’s quality of care has steadily improved in recent years, and she raised repeated complaints from the hospital system about KFF Health News’ reporting. The news organization has reviewed every complaint from Ballad and has never found a correction or clarification to be warranted in the coverage.

Tennessee Health Commissioner Ralph Alvarado, who has more than once described the regulation of Ballad Health as a matter of national importance, has declined or not responded to more than a dozen interview requests from KFF Health News to discuss the monopoly.
“Our effort and progress serve as a model for health care in Tennessee, the Appalachia Region, and the entire nation,” Alvarado said in a May news release about the monopoly, adding, “We do not take our role lightly as we remain committed to transparency in our COPA oversight.”
Tennessee’s revised agreement was negotiated behind closed doors for more than a year and announced to the public in early May. As part of that announcement, Tennessee said it wouldn’t score Ballad next year, to give the company time to adjust to the new scoring process.
Under that process, the minimum score Ballad needs to meet to show a “clear and convincing” public benefit has been lowered from 85 out of 100 to 70 out of 100. The new agreement also awards Ballad up to 20 points for providing Tennessee with data and records — for example, a report on patient satisfaction — regardless of the level of performance documented. The state can also raise or lower Ballad’s overall score by up to 5 points in light of “reputable information” that is not spelled out in the scoring rubric.
Therefore, Ballad can score as low as 65 out of 100, with nearly a third of that score awarded for merely giving information to the state, and still be found to be a “clear and convincing” benefit to the public, which is the highest finding Tennessee can bestow, according to the agreement. And Ballad could score as low as 55 out of 100 without the monopoly facing a risk of being broken up, according to the new agreement.
The agreement also increases how much of Ballad’s annual score is directly attributed to the quality of care provided in its hospitals, from 5% to 32%. But the agreement obscures how this will be measured.
Tennessee sets “baseline” goals for Ballad across dozens of quality-of-care issues — like infection rates and speed of emergency room care — and then tracks whether Ballad meets the goals. The new agreement resets these baselines to values that were not made public, leaving it unclear how much the goals for Ballad have changed. Health department spokesperson Dean Flener said the new baselines would not be disclosed until 2027.
Cook, the longtime leader of protests against Ballad, said she believes Tennessee is attempting to silence data-supported criticism until the final year of the 10-year COPA agreement, which ends in 2028.
By then, any outrage would be largely moot, she said.
“If you are going to wait until the last year to tell us the new measurements, why bother?” Cook said. “It is clear, without a shadow of a doubt, that the Tennessee Department of Health is putting the needs and concerns of a corporation above the health and well-being of people.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)MACKINAC ISLAND – With a little over a month until the July 1 deadline, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) told the Michigan Advance she has concerns about whether the Legislature would be able to pass the state’s budget for Fiscal Year 2026 before the end of June.
“We’re at the stage where we need to negotiate the differences between a House budget and a Senate budget, and the House has not passed what you can reasonably or meaningfully call a budget that we can even negotiate from. So they’re pretty far behind in the process. And so that gives me pause about that deadline,” Brinks said. 
Michigan House Republicans took control of the chamber in the 2024 election, winning a 58-52 majority and bringing an end to Democrats’ trifecta control of the House, Senate and governor’s seat. As a result, the Legislature has deadlocked, passing only four bills since the start of the year. 
Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has repeatedly refused to commit to meeting the July 1 deadline, when lawmakers are legally required to pass a budget. However, the state’s fiscal year does not start until Oct. 1, with Hall telling reporters in January that the budget may not be done until Sept. 30. A failure to have a budget in place by the Oct. 1 deadline would force a state government shutdown.
As Democrats raise alarms about the potential for a shutdown, House Republicans have passed what they call a “shutdown prevention plan” which allocates $20 billion for critical programs like schools and local law enforcement if the Legislature cannot reach an agreement by the end of September.

While there is no penalty if lawmakers fail to agree on a new budget by July 1, Brinks noted in an interview with the Advance during the Mackinac Policy Conference that completing the budget on time is critical for municipalities, K-12 schools and universities. 
“They’re all making their plans right now for how they expend resources and serve their folks that they serve. I don’t want to show up at my kid’s school and find out that they didn’t know enough about the resources they have coming from the state to be able to hire enough teachers to teach the kids and have larger class sizes. That’s a completely unnecessary thing, and it’s completely avoidable,” Brinks said. 
And while Hall has slammed the Democratic-led Senate for failing to act on bipartisan road funding legislation and policies establishing a public safety and violence prevention fund to support local law enforcement and community violence intervention organizations, Brinks said those conversations need to be held in the context of the state’s budget. 
“You know something like the public safety trust fund, while there’s a policy element to it, it’s essentially a budget conversation. So get back in the room and have a budget conversation. I know our appropriations chairs have had some conversation, but there’s so much more to the process…. This is exactly the kind of thing that could be worked out in a budget process, and there will, by necessity, need to be compromise,” Brinks said. 
Similarly, allocating $3 billion towards road funding should also be subject to bipartisan discussion, Brinks said. 
“So far, there hasn’t been a lot of willingness to actually have those conversations between us from Matt Hall, and so, you know, at that point, they’re simply just ideas that have been thrown out in the ether. The real work comes in the conversation, in the negotiation, in the sitting down and hashing things out,” Brinks said.
“It’s not glamorous, right? You don’t get to start in your own press conference for two hours as a negotiation. That’s not negotiating. If he wants to do that, that’s fine. But in addition to that, he’s going to have to really find some time or empower his caucus, and there are some capable people there to sit down and really, do that work,” Brinks said. 
While the House and Senate were able to break through their deadlock earlier this month to extend the filing deadline for lawmakers’ legally-required financial disclosures amid frustrations with the rollout of the state’s new financial reporting  system, Brinks said there are several other policies they could be working on if Hall was interested. 
“We could be talking about prescription drug affordability. We could be talking about ways to ensure, you know, we have more affordable housing, we could, you know, be talking about FOIA, you know, something that passed with a really strong bipartisan vote,” Brinks said. 
In January, members of the Senate voted 33-2 to advance Senate Bills 1 and 2 to the House. The package looks to extend FOIA to include the Legislature, the governor and the lieutenant governor, which are exempt under the current state law. However, Hall has declared the package dead, calling them “a very low priority.”
While Hall has pointed to the public safety trust fund as a bipartisan slam dunk, Brinks said the same about FOIA reform.
“It could be an easy bipartisan win that really helps improve transparency and the ethical environment in our state,” she said.

The attorneys for former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and former Republican leader Matt Borges are feeling “hopeful” after a Cincinnati politician convicted of bribery got a pardon from President Donald Trump.
Once convicted of accepting $20,000 in bribes, former Cincinnati City Councilmember PG Sittenfeld’s slate has been wiped clean.
President Donald Trump pardoned the Democrat, who was sentenced to more than a year in prison in 2023.
And with this pardon comes interest from other influential Ohio politicos.
We asked Householder’s attorney Scott Pullins if that gives him hope for Householder.
“Yeah, I can’t comment, obviously, on what we’re doing right now, what I’m working on, our legal team’s working on,” Pullins replied. “But it certainly gives us a lot of hope.”
Thursday, Borges’s appeals attorney, Dennis Belli, said in a phone interview that the Sittenfeld pardon also gives him hope.
In March 2023, a jury found Householder and Borges guilty of felony racketeering in the largest public corruption and bribery scandal in state history.
And earlier this month, a panel of federal court judges upheld the convictions of Householder and Borges.
Clemency
We asked Gov. Mike DeWine if he believes Householder and Borges should be pardoned.
“Look, I don’t have any comment about the pardons,” he responded. “These are decisions that are made by the president of the United States. I have authority in regard to state pardons, and I always will tell you about why I made a decision.”
Pullins has been telling us for months now that the former speaker is seeking clemency, arguing the FBI was politically motivated in arresting the former speaker.
“They singled out Larry, him alone,” he said. “No one else has been charged, no other politician — period.”
Legal expert Steve Gooden, partner at Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, said this could be a sympathetic argument for a pardon.
“It obviously strikes very close to home for Donald Trump who has been the subject of these kinds of inquiries and cases in the past,” Gooden said.
In an interview in February, Attorney General Dave Yost refuted this allegation.
“He was indicted by President Trump’s United States Attorney, David DeVillers, who, I believe, is the same political party,” Yost said. “I don’t think that dog hunts.”
And Yost said he was against Householder getting out. Householder is also facing Ohio charges. He has pleaded not guilty to 10 felony counts in Cuyahoga County.
“I oppose,” Yost said in February. Asked why, he said, “Because I’ve seen the evidence and he committed multiple crimes. Even if his appeal is successful in the federal case, there is additional evidence of criminal acts that are included in the state’s indictment.”
If convicted on state charges and appeals fail, it would take an act of the governor to clear him of that.
Previously, Pullins told us in an interview that the team is hoping to leverage Householder’s close relationship with Trump to get him out.
Asked about the appearance that Householder could be using his connections in order to get out of prison, Pullins responded, “Well, yeah. He is. Hopefully, he has some friends left that can help.”
After our exclusive, in-depth interview in 2023, we’ve kept in touch with the head juror, Jerrod Haines, who convicted Householder in federal court.
He said that Householder was, once again, using power to get what he wanted.
“I definitely feel like he is using his connections to skip his sentence,” he said. “I would feel that the justice system failed if he would be pardoned. I would feel that my time as a juror was wasted, even though I think it was a very valuable experience for me, my life was interrupted for seven weeks.”
Haines told us in 2023 that he was left disillusioned with state government, hoping political leaders would finally learn not to undercut their citizens in exchange for power and money.

(Getty Images)More West Virginia students are completing the college financial aid application, known as the FAFSA, following pandemic interruptions and nationwide issues with the form over the last year. 
According to data tracked by the National College Attainment Network, the state’s Free Application for Federal Student Aid completion rate stands at 49.8%.
The state now ranks 15th in the nation for students completing the FAFSA, which is up from 19th last year, according to a news release from the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission.
Brian Weingart, senior director of financial aid at the commission, said the HEPC has worked side-by-side with schools, counselors and communities to make sure students had “a clever path to financial aid.” HEPC credits the success to statewide partnerships. 
“Whether it’s through hands-on FAFSA events, real-time data tools, or text message nudges, we’re meeting students where they are and helping them take that critical next step toward college. Behind every completed FAFSA is a student who’s one step closer to their future,” he said.
The federal government’s 2024 botched rollout of the new FAFSA form prompted former Gov. Jim Justice to declare a state of emergency and suspended a requirement that college-bound high school seniors fill out the FAFSA in order to receive state financial aid, including the state’s Promise Scholarship.
Unlike some other states, West Virginia didn’t have a statewide FAFSA mandate. Instead, the HEPC said it focused on strategic outreach and community engagement. 
A WV FAFSA day in February brought together more than 50 high schools and colleges. The organization also used “TXT 4 Success,” a text message program that provides personalized guidance and nudges to help students stay on track with financial aid deadlines.
“West Virginia’s success, and approach, offer a lot for other communities and states to learn from,” said Bill DeBaun, senior director at the National College Attainment Network in Washington. “Thoughtful, coordinated efforts like these that support practitioners in districts and schools make a big difference.”
West Virginia’s Chancellor of Higher Education Dr. Sarah Armstrong Tucker added, “We built momentum through strong partnerships with our schools and counselors, innovative tools and a shared commitment to our students’ futures. I am deeply proud of our team and the many school counselors, educators, and families who have rallied around this cause. Together, we’re showing what’s possible when we put students first.”

Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — An inmate slated for execution on one of his two death sentences chose to die by lethal injection soon after the state Supreme Court declined to require more information about execution methods.
The execution of 57-year-old Stephen Stanko is set to take place at 6 p.m. June 13. His would be the sixth execution in the state since the process resumed in September, following a state Supreme Court ruling that firing squad and electrocution were constitutional.
Two of those inmates selected firing squad as the way they wished to die. Three died by lethal injection. Inmates also have the option of electrocution, which none have chosen since 2008.
  Stephen Stanko, 57, is scheduled to be executed June 13. (Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)
Attorneys for Stanko, who was sentenced to death in two separate cases for crimes committed within two days of each other, asked for more information about the state’s protocols for firing squad and lethal injection, arguing the most recent firing squad execution in April didn’t go the way prison officials planned.
The state Supreme Court turned down that request Wednesday, writing that attorneys failed to prove anything went wrong during that execution or previous ones carried out using lethal injection.
Two bullets struck Mahdi in the same spot in his chest, causing the two wounds instead of the three defense attorneys expected, prison officials and attorneys for the state have said. Those bullets then took the same route through Mahdi’s body, including striking part of his heart.
A pathologist hired by defense attorneys for both Mahdi and Stanko compared Mahdi’s autopsy report to a previous one in which inmate Brad Sigmon’s heart was completely destroyed, unlike in Mahdi’s case, where most of the damage seemed limited to other organs.
If that was the case, it doesn’t seem to be because the Department of Corrections failed to follow protocols, justices wrote in the Wednesday order. Various factors, including whether Mahdi shifted in the chair to which he was strapped, could have moved the target and caused the marksmen to not strike his heart precisely.
The justices also turned down attorneys’ arguments that the state failed to follow its own protocols during previous lethal injection executions by administering a second dose of the sedative pentobarbital after 10 minutes. That second dose is written into the state’s protocol, which is not released publicly, justices wrote.
Stanko’s crime spree started April 7, 2005, when he strangled his girlfriend, Laura Ling, to death at her home in Murrell’s Inlet while beating and raping her 15-year-old daughter, according to court documents. Stanko slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead before stealing jewelry and credit cards and fleeing.
He went to his friend’s house in Conway. After having breakfast with his friend Henry Turner, Stanko shot the 74-year-old in the back while he shaved in the bathroom mirror, using a pillow as a silencer for his gun, according to court documents.
Stanko then hit Turner in the head and fatally shot him in the chest.
Driving Turner’s truck, Stanko went to Columbia, where he spent an evening buying people drinks at bars before traveling to Augusta, Georgia. There, Stanko convinced a woman he was a businessman in town for the Masters golf tournament and went home with her, according to court records.
Stanko stayed with the woman, including attending church with her, until April 12, when he left abruptly in the middle of the night. Soon after he left, the woman recognized his photo in the newspaper alongside a headline about Turner’s death and called the police, who captured Stanko before he left the city, according to court records.
During Stanko’s trials, defense attorneys argued to no avail that he was insane at the time of the killings, with decreased brain functioning making him unable to understand right and wrong.
A jury convicted Stanko in 2006 of killing Ling and beating and raping her daughter. A separate jury convicted him in 2009 of killing Turner. Both juries recommended death sentences, which multiple courts have affirmed.
Turner’s killing is the crime for which Stanko is set to be put to death in June.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

Now a formal notification of its 'noncompliance' with federal immigration policy is forthcoming, says the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Exactly what court order the Trump administration is using to base its declaration that Rhode Island is defying federal immigration policy remains a mystery. But the head of the state’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has a theory.
The state as well as Providence and Central Falls are on a list of 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions” that may lose federal funding released Thursday night by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The list was compiled based on factors like noncompliance with federal law enforcement, information-sharing restrictions, and giving legal protections to undocumented immigrants, the department’s website stated.
The website also states that Rhode Island made the list because of a “Court Order Requiring State Sanctuary Requirements.” Rhode Island Current reached out to Homeland Security for specific details and received a statement reiterating the designation factors on the department’s website. 
Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, hypothesized that the federal government may be citing a 2014 federal court order that ruled police officers in Rhode Island cannot hold a person in custody based upon an U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer alone for more than 48 hours.
“It’s a very basic Fourth Amendment law,” Brown said in an interview. “And it appears the Trump administration is upset that the Constitution prevents them from doing what they want to do.”
The Department of Homeland Security’s list was published as part of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump April 28 mandating federal officials identify and publicly highlight jurisdictions that “refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.”
“These sanctuary city politicians are endangering Americans and our law enforcement in order to protect violent criminal illegal aliens,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Thursday. “We are exposing these sanctuary politicians who harbor criminal illegal aliens and defy federal law.”
The announcement from the Department of Homeland Security states each jurisdiction on the list will receive a formal notification of its “noncompliance” with federal policy and must immediately review and revise its policies to align with the Trump administration.
No notices received yet
Gov. Dan McKee’s office has not received any notification as of Friday, said spokesperson Olivia DaRocha. Officials in Central Falls and Providence said their cities have not received any notice either.
“As we have always stated, Rhode Island cooperates with ICE on the lawful detention of criminals in accordance with a binding federal court ruling,” DaRocha said in an emailed statement, referring to the 2014 court order.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said in a statement that he has no plans to change the city’s existing policy regarding immigration. Police officers are prohibited from asking about someone’s immigration status and from holding a subject “based exclusively” on an administrative detainer, nor are they allowed to arrest suspected undocumented individuals unless federal immigration officers provide a criminal warrant signed by a judge.
“The Providence Police are not and will not be immigration officers and are better able to keep our community safe with this policy,” Smiley said. “Providence remains committed to being a safe and welcoming city for all.”
  Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera says her city stands by its laws and its community. (Screenshot from centralfallsri.gov/)
Central Falls in 2019 enacted its own ordinance that prohibits local police officers from questioning people about their immigration status without probable cause, bar any compliance with detainer requests made without a warrant, and ensure municipal services are available to all residents regardless of their citizenship.
Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera in a statement said her city stands by its values and community. 
“Our ordinance is legal and makes our city safer –– building a stronger foundation for public trust in our local police department,” Rivera said. “Together with the city of Providence, we won this fight before during the first Trump Administration.”
Rivera was referring to a 2018 lawsuit against the U.S. Justice Department over requirements that recipients of a federal criminal-justice grant, known as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant, cooperate with authorities in the enforcement of federal immigration law.
U.S. District Court Judge Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ruled in favor of the cities in 2019, which was upheld by a federal appeals court in Boston in 2020.
But the chairman of Rhode Island’s Republican Party said the state’s placement on the list was the result of “deliberate, reckless choices” by the governor and city officials.
“Let’s be clear, this isn’t compassion, it’s capitulation,” party chairman Joe Powers said in a statement. “McKee is harboring those who break federal law while turning his back on those who enforce it.” 
“President Trump is standing up to this nonsense,” he continued.
Brown, however, maintains that there’s not legitimate basis from the federal government that Rhode Island or any municipalities are violating federal law. 
“They’re not, they’re upholding the law,” he said.

House Bill 1217, signed into law this month by Gov. Bob Ferguson, restricts annual residential rent increases to 7% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower.
The state Department of Commerce calculated the former option as 10.8%. Since that’s above the threshold, rent increases are capped at 10% through the end of 2025.
The maximum allowable increase for 2026 is expected to be published in July, based on inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The highly divisive legislation went into effect immediately after Ferguson’s signature. 
Democrats hope the new cap provides greater predictability to tenants whose lives can be turned upside down by major rent increases. Progressives had initially pushed for a hard 7% limit, but raised it to win over moderate Democrats in the Legislature.
Republicans termed the bill “rent control” and argued it would chill development and price out small landlords. After the governor signed the new law, the Rental Housing Association of Washington said it was exploring a legal challenge.
Rent hikes are no longer allowed in the first year of a tenancy under the law either.
Not all rental properties are subject to the cap. 
New construction is not covered for its first 12 years. Public housing authorities, low-income developments, and duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes in which the owner lives in one of the units are also exempt.
Notices of rent increases are now required 90 days before they go into effect, up from 60 days under previous law.
Increases are capped at 5% for manufactured homes.
If a landlord raises rent above the caps without an exemption, the renter must give the landlord a chance to fix the error or can terminate their lease with 20 days’ notice. A tenant or the state attorney general can bring litigation to enforce compliance. The attorney general can recover up to $7,500 per violation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apartments-tacoma-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

The department released the list as part of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump requiring that sanctuary jurisdictions across the country be listed. 
“Sanctuary jurisdictions including cities, counties, and states that are deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities,” the DHS announcement states. “Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in peril.” 
Dane County, Madison and Milwaukee have enacted policies that limit local law enforcement agencies’ collaboration with federal immigration authorities. Earlier this year, Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett announced that the county would no longer participate in a program that provides funding in exchange for telling federal agencies when an immigrant without legal status is in custody in the local jail. Milwaukee also refuses to share such information. 
“DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,” DHS stated.
But Shawano County, which Trump won with 67% of its vote last year, is a Republican Party stronghold that appears out of place on the list. The DHS announcement states that “no one should act on this information without conducting their own evaluation of the information.” 
In 2021, the Shawano County board voted to declare the county a “Second Amendment sanctuary county,” which declared the county sheriff would not enforce any laws which “unconstitutionally impedes our fundamental Second Amendment right to Keep and Bear Arms.” 
The Shawano County administrator and sheriff did not respond to requests for comment.

(Getty Images)Granite Staters continue to overwhelmingly cite the scarcity of affordable housing as the most pressing concern, a new poll from the University of New Hampshire suggests.
Faced with a range of options that included taxes, education, jobs, and cost of living, 36% of respondents to the poll said housing is “the most important problem facing New Hampshire” — far and away the biggest share. The next highest category was taxes; 10% of respondents chose that as the most important issue.
But when it comes to the most likely legislative approach to address the housing shortfall this year, residents are more divided.
The poll, released Thursday, asked respondents whether they support legislation that would require cities and towns to relax their zoning policies to make it easier to build a home. Thirty-eight percent supported that legislation — 15% strongly — but 40% opposed it. Of those that were against it, 18% were strongly opposed.
The response comes as the Republican-led Legislature has passed a pair of bills that would bar municipalities from making certain zoning restrictions; both bills are making their way to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk.
House Bill 631 would require municipalities to allow multi-family developments in commercial zones, such as shopping areas. And House Bill 577 would allow homeowners to build a detached accessory dwelling unit by right and expand the size limitations to do so.
The issue of housing scarcity dominated both Democratic and Republican campaign platforms in 2024, and lawmakers in both parties have found common ground in legislation that would forcibly remove local zoning barriers to housing. 
Some groups, such as the New Hampshire Municipal Association, are opposed to those bills, arguing that cities and towns should be able to craft their own zoning codes and should react to the housing shortage with approaches supported by their residents. 
Republican lawmakers have shown less support this year for devoting state resources to encourage more development; the House-passed budget would eliminate the Housing Champion Program, a 2023 effort to give special grants and state support to towns that voluntarily changed their zoning codes to be more friendly to housing. House and Senate lawmakers have also blocked efforts to increase the amount of money going to the state’s affordable housing fund, which is currently allocated $5 million of state tax revenues per year. 
The May 29 UNH poll was released three months after a poll conducted by YouGov on behalf of Housing Action New Hampshire, a housing advocacy group, appeared to show more support for zoning changes. 
In that poll, conducted March 3 to 10, more than 75% of respondents supported policies to “allow more homes near business and shopping districts,” allow “flexibility for paved parking areas,” “allow homes on slightly smaller lots,” and “make it easier to build accessory dwelling units.” The Housing Action poll also found that 54% of respondents said building more homes is more important for New Hampshire than protecting the character of neighborhoods from change, compared to 35% who said the opposite and 11% who were not sure. 
The Housing Action poll worded its questions differently than the UNH poll; the former poll asked about legislation that would “allow” homeowners to build certain structures, while the latter poll asked about legislation that would “require” cities and towns to change their zoning codes to achieve that.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-30 18:57:50+00:00,Mississippi Today,Lexington residents urge court to scrutinize police abuse claims,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/30/lexington-residents-urge-court-to-scrutinize-police-abuse-claims/,Lexington residents ask federal appeals court to hear oral arguments on police abuse claims.,"Lexington community members joined attorneys and the National Police Accountability Project to urge a federal appeals court to consider evidence in a civil rights lawsuit against the police department alleging a pattern of violent, racist and unconstitutional policing practices. 
A Wednesday filing asks the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to hold oral arguments to consider evidence presented at a 2022 hearing and legal arguments that the U.S. District Court overlooked the evidence in dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims. 
Attorneys for the Black Lexington residents who claim they have been stopped at checkpoints, falsely arrested and retaliated against by members of the police department say the plaintiffs had proper standing, their claims were proper and some claims were dismissed without properly analyzing evidence. 
“For those reasons, Malcolm Stewart, Darious Harris, and Robert Harris respectfully request that the judgment of the district court be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings,” the May 28 appellant’s brief states. 
The original lawsuit, filed in August 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missisisppi, documented conduct by the former white police chief, Sam Dobbins, who was fired in 2022 after bragging on a recording about killing 13 people while working as a law enforcement officer and using racial and homophobic slurs. 
That complaint also shows the conduct of his successor, Chief Charles Henderson, who is Black and has overseen a department that allegedly is violent against residents and has used roadblocks to exclusively target Black neighborhoods. 
Lexington, located in one of the state’s poorest counties, has a population of less than 2,000 people and is 86% Black. The city’s mayor is white and its aldermen are Black. 
The original lawsuit plaintiffs are brothers Robert and Darius Harris, Malcolm Stewart, Eric Redmond and Peter Reeves. Dobbins, Henderson, the police department and the city were named as defendants in the lawsuit. Later, four police officers were added as defendants. 
“This case is about more than a few rogue officers — it’s about a police department functioning as a tool of racial control and abuse,” Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, said in a statement.
Attorneys from the organization, along with attorney Jill Collen Jefferson of JULIAN and others are representing the appellants.
Bonds said the violations have persisted and escalated, which underscores why the organization’s clients are continuing with the case and why it remains critical.  
In 2022, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order against the Lexington Police Department to prevent them from violating Black residents’ civil rights and prevent violence against them, but a federal judge denied it.
Over the next two years the district court dismissed a majority of the plaintiffs claims, and two plaintiffs remained with claims against the officers, Dobbins and Henderson. 
In January, U.S. District Judge Tom Lee approved an agreed judgment between plaintiff Redmond and the defendants and dismissed all claims brought by the remaining plaintiffs. This is the decision being appealed with the 5th Circuit Court. 
Since 2022, there have been other federal lawsuits brought by Lexington residents against Dobbins, Henderson, the city and the police department. Most of those remain active in the district court or the 5th Circuit. 
In a Wednesday statement, the National Police Accountability Project said the Lexington lawsuit by the five men is an example of an urgent need for local and federal action to stop law enforcement abuse in the South and across the country. 
Last week, the Trump administration rolled back federal oversight of police departments by ending consent decrees and halting investigations. 
The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened a civil rights investigation into the Lexington police, but it did not result in a consent decree. 
The New Orleans Police Department had a consent decree that lasted from 2011 to 2024.
Bonds said the Trump administration’s move is a “deliberate slap in the face to the memory of George Floyd” close to the 5-year anniversary of his death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. 
She also said the move is an attempt to disempower Black communities, shut down paths to accountability and silence resistance. 
“But let us be clear: We are not backing down. We are doubling down,” Bonds said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/06150937/AP_22228581950173-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)Maine lawmakers will wait to take action on proposed legislation regarding the state’s 72-hour waiting period for firearm purchases.
The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee unanimously voted to carry over LD 208, a proposal from House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) to repeal the law passed just last year that requires someone who sells a firearm to wait three days before delivering it to the buyer. 
However, the committee was divided on whether to carry over an identical bill, LD 1230, with Democrats voting in support and Republicans opposed. The votes taken Friday were not an absolute, but rather a request of the presiding officers who have the final say on what will be carried over.
After the waiting period took effect in August, opponents filed a lawsuit in November claiming it violates the Second Amendment rights of people who have passed background checks. 
Earlier this year, a U.S. District Court judge sided with the gun rights advocates and temporarily paused the waiting period. Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey appealed the decision, but a federal appeals court last week refused to reinstate the waiting period while the lawsuit unfolds. 
Over the past few weeks, Senate co-chair Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) encouraged the committee to carry over Faulkingham’s bill and kill the other proposal to streamline the committee’s work and allow time for the legal process to play out before making any changes. 
However, multiple Republicans on the committee said they did not want their names on the record as voting against the bill. 
“I’m not going to have my name on that report and follow me forever,” said Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan), though she agreed it’s important to carry over one of the bills in case changes need to be made.
Stuck at a stalemate, Carney suggested Friday that the committee vote to carry over both bills, but Republicans also raised concerns with this approach. 
Committees are only allowed to carry over a limited number of bills from the first to second session, so some Republicans were concerned carrying over identical proposals would waste one of those slots and lead to Senate president and speaker of the House of Representatives killing one of the bills. 
“Why can’t we have a conversation on the floor?” asked Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), encouraging the committee to advance LD 1230 this session 
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), who voted to carry over both proposals, said his understanding was that the committee decided to not work on either bill while the lawsuit is ongoing. Since the committee hasn’t fully workshopped the bills, Lee said sending one to the chamber floors wouldn’t make sense.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline) Colorado Democratic lawmakers criticized Gov. Jared Polis after he vetoed a bill on Thursday afternoon that would have banned the use of computer algorithms to set rent in the state, calling the decision a failure of the state’s values.
“Gov. Polis had the opportunity to save Coloradans money, but he instead aligned himself with tech companies that are engaged in practices so questionable that they’re currently facing litigation from the federal government,” Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat and bill sponsor, said during a virtual press conference on Friday morning.
House Bill 25-1004 was written as a consumer protection bill to ban software that uses private market data to suggest profit-maximizing rents to landlords.
The Biden administration released a report last year that found software from companies like RealPage cost Denver renters an extra $136 per month, one of the highest monthly cost increases in the country, and is used in over 45% of multifamily rental units in the city.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser last year also targeted the practice when he joined an antitrust lawsuit against RealPage.
In his veto letter, Polis wrote that he prefers to allow “current state and federal investigations to run their course — including those Colorado is a party to.”
He wrote that he agrees with the intent of the bill, and that collusion to artificially constrain rental supply is already illegal, but he worried about its effect on the state’s housing market.
“We should not inadvertently take a tool off the table that could identify vacancies and provide consumers with meaningful data to help efficiently manage residential real estate to ensure people can access housing,” he wrote. “If signed today, this bill may have unintended consequences of creating a hostile environment for providers of rental housing and could result in further diminished supply of rental housing based on inadequate data.”
A RealPage spokesperson lauded Polis’ veto.
“This is the right outcome for all of us who desire a healthy housing ecosystem that benefits Colorado renters and housing providers alike,” Jennifer Bowcock of RealPage said in a statement.
The bill was sponsored by Gonzales, Sen. Nick Hinrichsen of Pueblo, Rep. Steven Woodrow of Denver and Rep. Javier Mabrey of Denver, all Democrats. A similar bill died last year, but this year’s version passed on party-line votes in both legislative chambers.
“During my time at the Legislature, we’ve been tasked by the governor to save people money,” Woodrow said. “During special sessions, we’ve been called down to cut property taxes to save homeowners an average of $80. Why we couldn’t find the means to save renters 200 times that with a stroke of a pen is simply beyond unfortunate. The governor has punted this to the courts.”
Groups that supported the bill included the Community Economic Defense Project, The Bell Policy Center, the Colorado Fiscal Institute and United for a New Economy. Supporters hoped the Biden White House report and pending litigation would help usher it into law this year.
“Unfortunately, the veto sends this devastating message that corporate landlords can keep using secret price-fixing algorithms to take extra rent from the people who have the least,” CEDP co-founder Sam Gilman said.
The veto is Polis’ 11th this year. He has until June 6 to sign or veto bills passed during this year’s legislative session, which concluded earlier this month.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The legislative session, which ended Friday, was a mixed bag for Gov. Kevin Stitt.
He got his income tax cut, business courts and ban on cellphones in schools, prompting him to say Wednesday it was probably the best session in his seven years in office.
“Look. The governor should be very happy,” House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said early Friday. “He got everything he wanted this session.”
But then came Thursday, effectively the final day of the legislative session. 
Lawmakers removed his embattled mental health commissioner and spent hours overriding dozens of his vetoes, including House Bill 1389, which expands insurance coverage for diagnostic mammograms.
Stitt panned both the veto overrides and Friesen’s firing.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters didn’t fare well, watching lawmakers and Stitt halt his efforts to require citizenship status checks for students and the completion of the  naturalization test for teachers. They also balked at his $3 million request to purchase Bibles for public school classrooms.
But lawmakers stopped short of putting the kibosh on his controversial social studies standards, dictating what must be taught in school, and which have already drawn a court challenge. 
The standards include language requiring students be taught about unfounded 2020 election “discrepancies,” the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and Bible stories.
Democrats said they were largely left out of the budget process.
While Stitt championed it, Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said the .25% income tax reduction was the worst bill of the session. It cuts the top bracket from 4.75% to 4.5% and contains a pathway toward eliminating the tax entirely.
“It is going to undermine our options as a state,” Kirt said.
Stitt let the general appropriations bill, outlining the state’s nearly $12.6 billion budget, take effect without his signature.
The budget gives most agencies a flat budget, but provides $250 million for the Oklahoma State University veterinary school and $200 million for a University of Oklahoma pediatric heart hospital.
Perhaps one of the most controversial measures passed and signed into law was a bill putting more restrictions on the process voters use to get things on the ballot.
Senate Bill 1027, which among other things implements restrictions on the number of people who can sign initiative petitions, is expected to draw a legal challenge.
Sports betting failed to get across the finish line for yet another year.
A bill that would have barred synthetic dyes and over a dozen other ingredients from food got left on the cutting room floor, as did a measure requiring a Ten Commandments display at the Capitol.
A bill that would add items to Oklahoma’s back-to-school sales tax holiday didn’t muster the support needed for passage nor did a measure that would have made Nov. 5 President Donald J. Trump Day in Oklahoma.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds has just two weeks to either sign or veto a controversial bill that would impact carbon dioxide pipelines in Iowa. 
On a Friday press call, landowners urged Reynolds to uphold Iowa and GOP values around property rights by signing the bill into law. 
House File 639 advanced from the Senate May 13, following four years of effort from a group of landowners and House lawmakers. The bill would do a number of things including require carbon sequestration projects prove they are a common carrier, in order to use eminent domain. 
The legislation, and landowner support, comes largely in response to a proposed carbon sequestration pipeline project, the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, that would connect to nearly 60 ethanol plants and pipe the sequestered carbon dioxide through Iowa and surrounding states to underground storage in North Dakota.

Those opposed to the project say a private company should not be given the right to condemn agricultural land. South Dakotans recently codified that opinion with a law that specifically bans CO2 pipelines from the right of eminent domain, which has caused Summit to reevaluate its path through the state. 
Marty Maher, an affected landowner from Montgomery County, urged Reynolds to uphold the Iowa Republican platform, which opposes the use of eminent domain by the use of a private party or for-profit entity. 
“Do party platforms mean anything to the elected Republican officials, or are platforms just feel-good projects for the party faithful?” Maher asked. 
Maher said the bill “levels the playing field” between landowners, neighbors and the utilities commission.
“I am sure that you want to be remembered as the governor that supported common sense property rights in Iowa and leveled the playing field for all residents in the state for many years to come,” Maher said, addressing his comments to the governor. 
Mary Powell, a Shelby County landowner, shared a similar sentiment and recalled times the governor quoted Iowa’s motto, “Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.” 
“Like many Iowans, I appreciate Gov. Reynolds stating the Iowa motto is a belief and not empty words, but Iowans need action,” Powell said. “We need Gov. Reynolds to sign 639 into law.” 
Reynolds said last week on Iowa Press she was meeting with stakeholders on both sides to determine her stance on the bill.
Another Shelby County landowner, Cindy Hansen, said on the Friday call that she and other landowners met with the governor and her advisory team Thursday evening to share their point of view. 
Hansen said the governor did not ask any questions or give an indication as to how she would act, but did listen to the landowners’ perspective.
The bill would also increase the insurance requirements for CO2 pipeline operators to cover any accidental or intentional discharges and any insurance rate increases landowners face because of the pipeline. The bill additionally requires Iowa Utilities Commissioners to be present at all hearings and expands the scope of who may intervene in IUC proceedings.
Meghan Sloma, said on Friday’s call that as a neighbor to the pipeline, she was not allowed to testify in the IUC hearings because it didn’t go through her property, even though she would be “very much affected” by the pipeline. 
“I think that’s very important, that the right that I have for my voice to be heard regarding what happens to my land, that it be protected,” Sloma said. “To me, it is just basic fairness and equality.” 
Sloma said while the pipeline project brought up the need for this legislation, the bill is not “anti pipeline” or “anti progress.” 
Opponents of the bill include farming organizations like Iowa Corn Growers Association and the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, who argue the legislation would stop Iowa from entering the ultra-low carbon ethanol market. 
This loss of market, they argue, would in turn hurt Iowa farmers and the state’s economy. IRFA also argued in a press conference last week, that the bill has a slew of “unintended negative consequences.”

Ingham County Judge Molly Hennessey Greenwalt heard arguments from the defense for Lee and Stephanie Chatfield and the Michigan Attorney General’s Office in February, determining this week that there was probable cause for the charges and the case should proceed to trial.
The Michigan Attorney General’s Office contends that through investigatory efforts by authorities beginning in 2021, it was discovered that the Chatfields had for years used nonprofit money to reimburse themselves for purchases at souvenir shops at Universal Studios during a family trip, transactions at retail stores like Coach and expenses at a strip club, amongst other expenditures.
The Chatfields’ attorney Mary Chartier has asserted that the charges brought against the former House Speaker, a prominent Republican in Michigan who raised millions of dollars while he was Speaker, are rooted in the political agenda for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat.

The investigation into Lee Chatfield began back in December 2021, when his sister-in-law, Rebekah Chatfield, reported to police in Lansing that he had sexually assaulted her for years, starting  when she was 14 or 15 years old. Michigan State Police opened an investigation into the report, also looking into financial behavior, which was later taken over by Nessel’s office which did not find sufficient evidence to pursue charges for criminal sexual conduct.
Lee Chatfield faces 13 felony counts of crimes related to conducting a criminal enterprise, conspiracy and embezzlement, while his wife faces two felony counts.
Nessel released a news statement Friday expressing gratitude that the efforts of her office led to the case moving forward to trial after a long investigation period and legal process.
“Our investigation uncovered extensive evidence of elaborate schemes to embezzle and misappropriate private and public funds to bankroll Lee Chatfield’s lifestyle during his time as Speaker of the House,” Nessel said in the statement. “My office will continue to pursue public corruption with every tool at our disposal and push for stronger transparency and good governance in our state.”

According to the board, Dr. Joshwa Tromblee “exchanged inappropriate messages” with a female patient he first saw at MercyOne’s Centerville Medical Center on Sept. 24, 2021. Tromblee was a family-medicine physician at that time.
Tromblee saw the patient again on Aug. 8, 2022, and April 3, 2023. The patient subsequently sent Tromblee a Facebook friend request, after which the two exchanged messages on Facebook and Snapchat. The exchanges included “sexually inappropriate messages and sexually explicit pictures,” the board alleges.
Tromblee also sent the patient money on one occasion, according to the board. At some point, MercyOne reviewed Tromblee’s social media exchanges with the patient and determined he had violated the standard of conduct and crossed a line by engaging in an inappropriate patient-physician relationship. He was placed on paid administrative leave on April 12, 2023, and was fired nine days later, according to the board.
Twenty-three months later – one week after Tromblee’s license expired — the Board of Medicine charged Tromblee with sexual misconduct and, at the same time, agreed to a settlement to resolve the case.
The settlement entails an indefinite suspension of Tromblee’s license. He is required to schedule a multidisciplinary fitness-for-duty assessment within 30 days, and to comply with any and all recommendations stemming from the evaluation.
He also is required to complete a course on professional ethics. Once reinstated, his license will be placed on probation for three years.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BOARD-OF-MEDICINE.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)It was a marathon week of voting. Debates were had, gavels were broken, and senators took a break from policy to discuss what sort of vehicle they would be if given the choice (Sen. Craig Hickman, a train; Sen. Mark Lawrence, a submarine; Sen. Joe Baldacci, a “big red firetruck,” etc.) 
In many cases, the Maine Senate and House of Representatives split over whether to support legislation. Often this would kick off a series of votes and if neither backed down from their position (“recede and concur”) the bill would ultimately die.
Here’s a look at what passed, what didn’t, and what’s still in limbo.
Bills that passed:
Following the Senate last week, the House voted 108-33 to back LD 1219, which provides the University of Maine System a 6% funding increase for the next two fiscal years. 
House and Senate members voted in favor of a bill (LD 60) that would allow employees to request a flexible work schedule. Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford), who voted against the measure, said it could be devastating for farmers and isn’t necessary since current law doesn’t prohibit someone from making such a request but Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) said there are many situations where an employer can deny a request but the bill is mostly about ensuring employees aren’t retaliated against for asking.
The chambers also passed a bill (LD 61) regulating employer surveillance of employees.
The House and Senate voted in favor of legislation (LD 1462) that prevents municipalities from adopting ordinances that prohibit vendors of expressive material, like books, writings, visual art, though it allows for the adoption of restrictions on time, place and manner of vending.
Both chambers backed LD 1017, which would reimburse shelters for the cost of providing food served at emergency shelters. The system currently reimburses shelters for the cost of issuing food vouchers but not providing meals themselves. (Read more about the issue here).
The House voted 78-62 to back an amended proposal (LD 784) to establish a “rebuttal presumption” — a legal assumption — in the event that a health insurance company denies coverage for specialized risk screening for a first responder whose provider has determined the screening is medically appropriate. An earlier version of the bill required health coverage of the screening, which would have carried a fiscal note. The Senate placed the measure on the appropriations table.
Both chambers unanimously backed a provision (LD 1234) that requires school boards to adopt a policy related to use of personal electronic devices during the school day.
Lawmakers backed legislation (LD 946) that would require the Efficiency Maine Trust to ensure that at least half of all available funding for electric vehicle rebates and incentives for weatherization and heat pumps is distributed to low-and moderate-income residents.
LD 1420, which would establish the Commission to Ensure a Just and Equitable Energy Transition for Maine’s Workforce, passed both the House and Senate.
Both chambers ultimately passed a bill (LD 301) that would allow the Public Utilities Commission to establish performance-based metrics and rate-adjustment mechanisms for a public utility. The Senate voted to pass an amended version of the bill after it was first rejected by the House last week. (Read about a similar proposal last session).
Another bill that had split the chambers but now passed is LD 1159, An Act to Prohibit Governmental Entities That Charge a Fee for In-person Credit Card Purchases from Refusing to Accept Cash.
Both chambers voted under the hammer to back legislation (LD 1425) to provide additional funding for two years to the Maine Resiliency Center in Lewiston to support the continuation and expansion of services for residents of the State affected by trauma.
Lawmakers also unanimously approved a bill (LD 1445) that would authorize an accredited financial institution to report suspected financial exploitation of a senior to the Office of the Attorney General. 
Rejected legislation:
House members voted 75-66 and senators voted 19-15 to reject a resolution (LD 1437) proposing an amendment to the state constitution to specify that only U.S. citizens can vote in state or local elections. While supporters pointed to a past effort in Portland to expand the vote in municipal elections to all residents regardless of citizenship, Rep. Laura Supica (D-Bangor) reiterated to her colleagues that “only citizens can vote in Maine elections. That is not disputed, that is not unclear, that is not ambiguous.” She added, “Let us not spend our time chasing ghosts or entertaining conspiracy theories that seek to erode public trust in our democratic institutions.”
Lawmakers also rejected a bill (LD 1329) that would include U.S. citizenship status on driver’s licenses and nondrive ID cards. Debate over the measure turned into a back and forth over whether noncitizens are voting in Maine elections, something Supica said is a myth. 
A majority of both chambers rejected a Republican proposal (LD 1331) to amend the state constitution so that if the Legislature adjourns “sine die,” or finally, the governor can’t reconvene the body for 90 days. (Read more about the bill here).
Both the House and Senate​​ rejected LD 160, which would eliminate REAL ID requirements in Maine. (Read more about the issue here).
Lawmakers voted against a bill (LD 112) to allow employers to pay high school students 50% of the state’s minimum wage for up to two years or until they graduate, which critics said would create a subclass of workers. (Read more about the proposal here).
Both chambers also opted against a bill (LD 853) that would divide the state’s counties into three regions and replace the statewide minimum hourly wage with a wage based on the cost of living in those regions. (Read more about the proposal here).
Following passage in both chambers, less than two-thirds of the House voted to enact LD 197, an emergency resolve directing the Governor’s Energy Office to Conduct a study regarding the future of electric transmission infrastructure in the state.
Both the House and Senates voted against legislation (LD 1288) that would amend certain provisions of Maine’s drug laws to expand the definition and possession amounts for what constitutes trafficking of heroin, fentanyl and cocaine.
After bouncing between chambers for weeks, a provision (LD 771) to amend the Maine Criminal Code to define “amphetamine” and “methamphetamine” to mean any compound, mixture or preparation containing any quantity of those substances failed after chambers failed to agree on the matter, with the Senate opposed and the House in support of the bill. Supporters said the change addressed a gap in drug laws but Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) argued the bill would lower the standard for what it means to be a trafficker because it’s common for people to cut drugs with other substances. 
The majority of lawmakers voted against a measure (LD 1024) that would expand the list of crimes that do not qualify for immunity under Maine’s Good Samaritan law, which concerns drug-related medical assistance. Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland) said the bill would weaken provisions passed in 2022 and inject confusion, hesitation and fear. Every overdose is a tragedy, she said, but the decline from 2022 to 2024 offers hope. 
Another bill that died after the chambers failed to agree is LD 16, which would have established separate prosecutorial districts in Downeast Maine. 
Legislation (LD 639) that would remove the Maine Criminal Justice Academy’s law enforcement training program’s residential requirement ultimately died after the chambers split with the Senate in support and House opposed to the bill. 
Lawmakers voted with the committee recommendation to reject a proposal (LD 724) to recognize the two main festivals in Islam, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, as state holidays.
LD 53, which would have established the November General Election Day as a school holiday for school buildings used as voting places, also failed after the chambers were unable to agree on the measure. 
House and Senate lawmakers voted to kill a bill (LD 775) to require voter approval of legislative and gubernatorial pay increases.
Lawmakers voted under the hammer to reject a bill (LD 1214), which would designate the Second Congressional District “Acadia.”
House lawmakers voted 76-65 and the Senate 20-15 to reject a bill (LD 1395) that would require that digital resources offered by schools must prevent a user from accessing obscene material. Though sponsor Rep. Reagan Paul (R-Winterport) said the bill would protect children from obscene content and the growing threat of human trafficking, Rep. Kelly Noonan Murphy (D-Scarborough) said that after hearing testimony from school information specialists and others, that this is already happening, filters are in place, and “school employees, staff, and administrators are looking out for kids when they are online.”
Both chambers rejected legislation (LD 885) that would allow those with a concealed carry permit to possess or discharge a firearm on school property. During debate, proponents noted this would only apply to those who completed the background check and adequate training. However, Rep. Kelly Noonan Murphy (D-Scarborough) said that if the bill passed and there was a situation on a school campus, there could be confusion about who should respond. 
The majority of the House and Senate voted against a bill (LD 1586) that would require the dollar amount of a school budget to be included on a budget validation referendum.
Both chambers rejected an effort (LD 1536) to roll back changes made to the state bail code in 2021.
Lawmakers voted in favor of the committee recommendation against LD 855, which would limit eligibility under the Maine Clean Election Act. Bill sponsor Rep. Davis Boyer (R-Poland) argued that the program should be available to candidates who need it most, not millionaires. 
With a 85-57 vote in the House and 21-13 vote in the Senate, lawmakers rejected legislation (LD 671) that would abolish the Maine income tax and establish a zero-based budget. 
A bill (LD 309) that would allow a political party to determine how its nominee is selected in a primary failed. Sponsor Rep. David Boyer (R-Poland) explained this would allow members of a party to decide if they want to use ranked-choice voting, a plurality, or “cornhole” to elect its nominee. 
Both the House and Senate overrode the majority of the committee by voting against a measure (LD 551) that would reign in some of the emergency powers of the executive branch. (Read about a similar bill here, which also died).
The Legislature voted against a bill (LD 1405) that would eliminate some of the authority granted to the Public Utilities Commission concerning participant funding.
Both chambers also rejected a bill (LD 732) that would prohibit the use of copyright protection for any work of the state except for merchandise sold by a department or agency.
Two bills that sought to restart a conversation around universal health care in Maine (LD 1269 and LD 1883) were unanimously opposed by the financial services committee and killed under the hammer in the chambers. (Read more about the bills here)
Limbo:
Legislation (LD 1022) to increase funding for the civil legal services fund, which supports the provision of free legal services to low-income defendants, passed both chambers but during the House enactment vote did not garner two-thirds support needed for the emergency bill to take effect. It has been placed on the appropriations table.
LD 525 is in limbo after the Senate split (17-17) and then tabled the measure, after the House narrowly rejected the proposal, which would clarify that someone has the right to discharge a firearm within 500 feet of school property if acting in self defense of their property.
The chambers are also split over a bill (LD 1063), with the Senate opposed and House in support, that would require the Public Utilities Commission to direct utilities to enter into contracts with generators fueled by municipal solid waste. Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) said the state is in a conundrum because folks don’t like burning trash to produce energy, but that trash is being landfilled, which people don’t like either. Critics argued the bill is poorly written and shifts the cost of these facilities from taxpayers to ratepayers. 
The chambers are at odds over a provision (LD 218) that would make student transfer agreements renew automatically, except in certain circumstances related to attendance or behavior, with the Senate in support and the House opposed.
These emergency bills have been enacted by more than two-thirds of both chambers and will take effect immediately upon the governor’s signature:

LD 23 – An Act to Extend the Period of Time a Dentist May Operate the Practice of a Deceased or Incapacitated Dentist 
LD 228 -An Act to Allow Coastal Seawalls to Be Raised by up to 2 Feet in Order to Accommodate Predicted Sea Level Rise
LD 860 – An Act to Allow the Public Advocate to Obtain Information from Public Utilities, Competitive Electricity Providers and Standard-offer Service Providers
LD 1128 – An Act to Modernize the Formulary for Naturopathic Doctors
LD 1306 – An Act to Continue the Exemption for Polystyrene Foam Disposable Food Service Containers Prepackaged at Wholesale
LD 1581 – An Act Regarding the Motor Vehicle Excise Tax and Registration Fees Exemption for Certain Veterans
LD 1836 – An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Sex Offender Management and Risk Assessment Advisory Commission Regarding Tier II Offenses
LD 1198 – Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to Assess Its Current Meat and Poultry Inspection Programs
LD 1243 – An Act Regarding the Licensing of Assisted Living Facilities 

*See below for a more complete list of bills that passed the Legislature this week.
Senate action
After initially bucking the committee recommendation and supporting legislation (LD 115) to assess impact fees on megayachts over 150 feet long, the Senate reconsidered the measure and ultimately voted 16-19 against passage. During debate, bill sponsor Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) said he didn’t think of the proposal as a tax but rather “a user fee that is being assessed for the potential damage that these mega yachts have inflicted upon our coastlines.”
After initially rejecting LD 893, senators voted to reconsider the bill and backed it. The proposal would exempt statewide nonprofit agricultural membership organizations that provide health care benefits and that meet certain requirements from the definition of “health insurance” under the Maine Insurance Code. According to proponents, this would provide a more affordable health care option for farmers.
Senators voted to pass LD 3, which would require Maine to adopt eastern daylight time year-round if approved by the federal government and also adopted by other states in the eastern time zone. Another bill (LD 4) that would outright establish year-round eastern daylight time for the state was tabled by the chamber.
Senators voted 10-25 to reject the committee recommendation against LD 681, and instead passed the proposal to gradually increase the percentage of the state appropriation for Maine Maritime Academy until it reaches relative parity with the University of Maine and the Maine Community College systems. Bill sponsor Sen. Nicole Grohowski (D-Hancock) said that although the state only provides 23% of funding for the school, it is “the highest return on investment for low income students among all public four year institutions.”
House action
Despite passionate debate, the House narrowly rejected (70-66 vote) legislation (LD 331) directing the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules to require the department to reimburse hospitals at least 75% of filed MaineCare costs within 90 days of receipt. Numerous lawmakers talked about rural hospital closures and proponents of the measure emphasized that the bill is about ensuring the state reimburses hospitals on time. 
Rep. Michele Meyer (D-Eliot) said the bill, which relies on existing resources, isn’t feasible and if lawmakers want to ensure hospitals get paid, they should have supported the failed supplemental budget proposal that would have made MaineCare funding immediately available for Medicaid providers like hospitals. The bill was then tabled in the Senate.
House lawmakers bucked the committee recommendation and voted against legislation (LD 339) that would pilot a Wabanaki-centered curriculum for Wabanaki children attending public schools. (Read more about the proposal here). 
A bill (LD 818) that would let a candidate use Clean Election Act funding to pay for the care of their dependents narrowly passed the House, with a 67-66 vote. It was tabled in the Senate.
The House narrowly rejected a bill (LD 1255) that would have limited free community college to students who meet the voting residency requirements and that resided in Maine for at least one year prior to enrollment. While proponents expressed concern Maine taxpayers were paying for out-of-staters to go to college for free, critics highlighted that the Maine Community College System has said it’s important to bring workers to the state.
House lawmakers voted 77-68 to reject legislation (LD 1881) that would mandate that parents are entitled to access all information regarding the school activities of their child, including reviewing available school services, teaching and instructional materials, and the child’s health care and education records, with the ability to refuse the child’s participation in any assignment or activity.
House lawmakers voted 93-51 in favor of a constitutional amendment (LD 820) to establish the right to hunt and fish. For it to pass, the bill will need the support of two-thirds of the Legislature. (More on this proposal here).

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Memorial Day 2025 kicked off what the Iowa State Patrol calls the “100 deadliest days of summer,” a period of time marked by an increase in teen driver crashes and fatalities. 
This time of year, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, is when many younger drivers are hitting the roads for the first time and others may be indulging in the holiday season.  Law enforcement agencies, including the Iowa State Patrol, increased their presence on the roadways over the holiday weekend and noticed a continued pattern of decreasing fatal crashes over the past three years.
“Our focus is to make the roadways a safe and enjoyable experience,” said Sgt. Alex Dinkla, public information officer for Iowa State Patrol. “This is one of those periods where that extra enforcement, we know, did pay off.” 
The state patrol arrested 21 individuals for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and covered over 47 crashes across the state. The Iowa Department of Transportation reported two fatal accidents in the days leading up to Memorial Day. 










Buckle that seatbelt, put the phone down and always remember, if you’re gonna go out and have some alcohol, to get that sober driver.


– Sgt. Alex Dinkla, public information officer for Iowa State Patrol


Many of the crashes occurred at intersections around the state. Dinkla noted that drivers often forget the blind spot on both sides of their car, between their windshield and door window. These blind spots can obscure entire vehicles from the driver’s view. Dinkla recommends drivers check two or three times before crossing an intersection to ensure they spot any threats.
In 2023, the DOT reported four fatal crashes in the days before the holiday, one of which was attributed to alcohol. In 2024, there were three fatal crashes. This year, the number dropped to two. Dinkla said that while the patrol doesn’t “want to call that a success because that’s still two fatalities,” it’s evident the extra presence and effort to educate the public is making a difference.
Going forward, Dinkla said, the ISP plans to utilize their Air Wing Unit, a unit of five pilots and aircrafts primarily used for traffic enforcement, more during other holidays and times of peak travel. Founded in 1956, the unit currently consists of three Cessna 182 aircraft, one Cessna 206 and one SR-22 CIRUSS. Two of the aircraft have thermal imaging equipment to aid in missing-person cases, fugitive location and specialized surveillance. 
“None of us know when we may or may not be involved in a fatal crash,” he said. “Buckle that seatbelt, put the phone down and always remember, if you’re gonna go out and have some alcohol, to get that sober driver.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/state-patrol-car-2.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

Gorman Foundation.(Photo by Getty Images)As the state continues to grapple with its record of not providing adequate behavioral health support for young people, a proposal to make funds available for schools to hire licensed behavioral and mental health experts has received initial backing from the Maine Legislature.
The Maine House of Representatives passed LD 858 on Wednesday with 79 members voting in favor and 68 opposed. The Senate passed it without a roll call vote. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach), will go back to both chambers for final enactment votes.
The bill establishes a program within the Maine Department of Education to provide grants to districts that contract licensed professionals for behavioral and mental health services. The funds can only be used to cover those not otherwise covered or reimbursable through MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. 
Proponents of the bill — including educators, administrators and medical professionals — say the grant program is much needed as Maine educators are not adequately trained to manage worsening student behavior issues, according to a 2025 Maine Education Policy Research Institute report. 
Critics of the proposal said it infringes on a parent’s rights when their child seeks counseling at school, and raised concern about the limited information about what kind of services would be covered under the grants. 
Gramlich said one in six Maine children have been diagnosed with anxiety, and 7% are struggling with depression. Further, 20% of Maine children have experienced two or more Adverse Childhood Experiences — higher than the national average of 17%. ACEs include experiences like violence or abuse, and the stress and trauma that accompanies them can have a lasting negative impact on a child’s wellbeing, according to data from the John T. Gorman Foundation that she cited during the floor discussion Wednesday. 
“Some school districts do offer these types of services in a school-based setting, but the current availability of school-based services is nowhere near adequate. Even when these school-based services are currently available, the funding of these services is so lean and precarious that the future of these programs is constantly in question,” she said, of the proposal that will cost $1.3 million in state funding. 
“These kids need help now. LD 858 would be an important step toward ensuring Maine students have the mental and behavioral health services they need,” she said.
Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls) raised concern about what she said was a lack of clarity around the scope of services provided. “What specific behavioral and mental health interventions are we funding? Who decides what is appropriate for each child, and how will parents be informed or asked for consent?” she asked. 
“This bill does not sufficiently protect a parent’s right to know and direct the mental and behavioral care their child receives in a school setting,” Lyman said.
The Legislature passed a similar bill last year that died on the special appropriations table, where bills that pass but aren’t otherwise provided for in the state budget compete for remaining funds. Those that are not explicitly funded by the budget committee ultimately die.
Maine has a record of not providing adequate youth mental health support. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state under the Americans with Disabilities Act for unnecessarily segregating children with behavioral health needs and failing to ensure they could thrive in a community-based setting. The state settled last November, with Gov. Janet Mills saying her administration and the Legislature will continue to invest in mental and behavioral health resources. 
“We all strongly agree that in-community behavioral health services are critical, and we are committed to continuing to strengthen the delivery of those services for Maine children who need them,” Mills said in a statement at the time. While the settlement agreement required Maine to expand the availability of community-based behavioral health services for children, it did not specifically add any of these services to schools.
The bill, if funded, “would provide Maine school-aged children with support they need by meeting them where they are most often, and that is their school,” Gramlich said.

For a few minutes on Friday, Gov. Josh Stein joined them.
North Carolina’s Department for Motor Vehicles is facing a months-long backlog of appointments — with a typically busy summer season ramped up further by demand for REAL I.D. Stein has tapped a new commissioner for the department, who’s outlining both a series of quicker fixes and a longer-term “overhaul.” He and top transportation officials visited one of the offices as they delivered remarks on the plans.
“Know that we’re working,” said Paul Tine, who was named DMV commissioner at the end of April. “Know that these folks have not been empowered in the way that they need to, and that’s my job to do that.”
  From left: North Carolina DMV Commissioner Paul Tine, Gov. Josh Stein and Secretary of Transportation Joey Hopkins speak to reporters about the DMV on Friday, May 30, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
Tine’s first order of business, he says, is improving working conditions and morale in the understaffed offices. The department is moving to increase pay for examiners. They’re beginning to upgrade some long-outdated equipment, and issue new uniforms “for the first time in five years.” And they’re shuffling employees around to reinforce frontline desks — assigning both volunteering central staff and summer interns into high-demand offices.
Motorists visiting DMV offices in the coming months can also expect to see some changes, Tine said. Staff are beginning to “triage” walk-in customers — meeting them as they walk up and making sure they have correct documents so they don’t waste time in line. Four additional offices, and 20 total, are now open for some hours on Saturdays.
And the DMV has been aiming to streamline its website, making it easier to navigate options and clearly identify if you need a REAL I.D. — and if so, what documents you need to bring.
Tine says a longer-term strategic plan to transform the department is in the works. But part of that plan depends on the General Assembly — and whether lawmakers choose to invest more money into hiring additional examiners and bolstering DMV resources.
House Republicans’ proposed budget largely follows the governor’s lead, allocating money to fund dozens of new examiner positions. That budget also green-lights efforts to modernize the DMV’s technology and proposes a study to determine whether the DMV could be privatized.
The Senate budget does not include such additions, with Senate leader Phil Berger expressing skepticism that the department deserves more tax dollars. State Auditor Dave Boliek’s office is currently conducting an audit of the department, with results expected in the coming months.
Tine, who currently owns Midgett Insurance Agency, is a former state representative. He was elected as a Democrat but left the party later, calling himself an independent and choosing to caucus with Republicans. He co-chaired the transportation appropriations committee while in the General Assembly.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1908-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)University of Florida President-elect Santa Ono could receive $3 million per year if the State University System’s Board of Governors confirms him next week. 
The proposed contract between UF and Ono includes a $1.5 million base salary for serving as president, $500,000 for serving as UF Health chair, more than $400,000 in annual performance bonuses, and another half-a-million in retirement contributions and retention payments. 
Despite unanimous approval by UF trustees, Ono’s presidency is being protested by some Republicans, while Gov. Ron DeSantis says he is leaving it up to the board he appointed to make the right decision. 
Tuesday, the 17-member Board of Governors will vote on Ono, who received unanimous approval from UF trustees this week. He is the sole finalist for the position. 
“I appointed all those folks, so they’ll make the judgement,” DeSantis said of the Board of Governors’ final vote. 
Former Gov. Rick Scott, U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, and U.S. Rep. and GOP gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds have publicly questioned Ono’s candidacy, as has Donald Trump Jr., who took to X to express his feelings on the candidate. 
“WTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!??? This woke psycho might be a perfect fit for a Communist school in California, but how is he even being considered for this role in Florida?” Trump Jr. posted Wednesday. “Every single member of the Florida Board of Governors should vote against him!!!”

Ono supported diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in his previous job as president of the University of Michigan, guiding its “DEI 2.0” initiative and touting benefits of such programs but ultimately closed DEI offices earlier this year. Some Republicans question the legitimacy of Ono’s new-found anti-DEI convictions. 
“Now people have pointed out a lot of statements that he has made that are not exactly what we’re looking for in a state where woke goes to die and I cringe at some of these statements,” DeSantis said Thursday, during a news conference in Fort Myers about medical negligence. 
“But basically, I think the folks that were involved in the search, after having interviewed him, spent time with him, it’s their judgement that he’s really kind of reached the limit on the campus leftism and he would want to leave Michigan where that’s prevalent to Florida where it’s frowned upon,” DeSantis said. 
Ono told trustees this week that he developed his new stance on DEI in the last year and a half after talking with students and other members of the university community. Before, he wasn’t an expert on the topic, which had been universal in higher education, he said. 
Florida Republicans and President Donald Trump’s administration have focused heavily on removing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives from higher education, including banning state expenditures on such initiatives.
“He will lose his job” if he promotes “a fountain of activism or leftist indoctrination,” DeSantis said.

WILMINGTON — Mayor John Carney has signed the City of Wilmington’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget ordinance, finalizing a spending plan that channels significant funding toward public safety, affordable housing, and neighborhood development. 
READ: Wilmington Council approves budget despite concerns over spending, utility costs
The budget includes targeted investments in several priority areas:

Affordable Housing: $2 million in capital funds will go toward building and rehabilitating housing units.
Neighborhood Development: A $2.5 million allocation will support the Neighborhood Stabilization Fund, including $500,000 for the Wilmington Neighborhood Conservancy Land Bank. The rest will fund home repair programs, alleyway cleanups, and tree removal efforts, with a focus on engaging minority contractors.
Support for Small and Minority-Owned Businesses: An additional $350,000 will be added to the Economic Development Strategic Fund.
Public Safety: The city will invest $4 million to launch a municipally operated ambulance service and support evidence-based policing practices.
Infrastructure: Capital funds will support street and sidewalk repairs, stormwater system upgrades, and park improvements.
Senior Tax Relief: The budget expands the city’s property tax exemption for residents age 65 and older living at or below the federal poverty level.


“This budget is about putting our values into action,” Carney said. “We’re building a stronger, safer, and more inclusive Wilmington—one that delivers for every resident.”
At the signing, Carney said the budget reflects shared priorities and invests in the areas that matter to residents. 
“We’re focusing on neighborhood revitalization, public safety, and essential services, while keeping taxes stable and supporting seniors,” he said. “Together, we’re building a Wilmington that works for everyone.”
Councilwoman Michelle Harlee, who chairs the Finance Committee, praised the collaborative process between Council and the administration.
“I’m excited for a number of reasons over this particular budget,” Harlee said. “It is a very much shared vision between the mayor, the administration, and the members of City Council. I’m very, very excited about the investments that are going to take place in our communities and around the city of Wilmington.”

Ellison explained the turnabout in a filing in which he said the arrested people had been found in an area his office thought was part of the new National Defense Area. It wasn’t. As a result, three people arrested in recent weeks won’t face newly created criminal charges for trespassing on a military base, punishable by up to a year in jail.
The dropped charges point to the ongoing confusion the new 400-square-mile military zone has created across branches of government and the courts since the U.S. Interior Department transferred the land to the Army in April.
“It is concerning that even the Acting United States Attorney is confused by the boundaries of this new National Defense Area,” a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) said in an emailed statement Thursday after Source New Mexico alerted his office to the dismissals. Heinrich has criticized the new NDA and called on the Defense Department to explain what it means for recreators and others.
On April 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the transfer of land from the Bureau of Land Management to the military, effectively making the 180-mile border New Mexico shares with Mexico into an extended military base tied to Fort Huachuca in Arizona. 
Along with increasing Army patrols and empowering the “military [to] take a more direct role in securing our southern border,” as President Donald Trump said, creating the zone also enabled federal prosecutors to impose misdemeanor charges on those caught in the new National Defense Area. 
Confusion about where that area falls exists not just among federal agencies tasked with enforcing the NDA, but also among residents who live, work and attend school along the border, including ranchers with BLM cattle leases and dual citizens who cross the border daily.
Source NM spent the weekend in the area and talked with residents who described whiplash from a transfer, seemingly overnight, of federal public lands into an extended military base.
The land includes parcels of private property surrounded by federal lands; the Diocese of El Paso, which owns nearby pilgrimage site Mount Cristo Rey; and the State of New Mexico, which has miles of trust land.

The land also traverses the Continental Divide Trail, and hosts both hikers on multi-state sojourns and hunters hoping to nab a rare Mearns quail, among heartier fare that hide among the creosote dotting the borderlands separating New Mexico from Mexico. 
Recently, the Defense Department issued a statement telling hikers and hunters they were prohibited from entering the NDA. That incensed Angel Peña, director of Nuestra Tierra Conservation Project, a Las Cruces-based nonprofit that tries to help marginalized communities experience and conserve public lands. 
“You’re really now affecting livelihoods,” Peña told Source New Mexico during a drive Memorial Day Weekend along the northern edge of the NDA. “You’re affecting dinner on the table. You’re affecting recreation. You’re affecting the traditional uses of this land that help families make memories and tell stories and grow ever closer.”
No man’s land 
Between April 15 and May 29, the federal government charged more than 550 people with unauthorized entry into the new National Defense Area, according to a review of federal records. 
Federal prosecutors dropped charges for three of them based on the errant arrests dropped May 22, per Ellison’s filings. According to court records, Ellison’s office learned “on or about May 15” that portions of the border area “previously understood as encompassed” by the newly created New Mexico National Defense Area “were not, in fact, transferred to the jurisdiction of the Army.”
The dismissed cases come amid ongoing legal challenges, with federal public defenders contesting the charges on a variety of fronts. Two weeks ago, a federal judge dismissed more than 100 charges against the defendants, largely because he was not convinced those arrested knew they were entering a restricted area. 
The circumstances of the recent dismissals regarding errant arrests are not clear. AUSA spokesperson Tessa Duberry declined to comment on where the defendants were arrested, saying the office can’t comment beyond what was filed publicly. 
She also declined to say how many total cases the office has dismissed on those grounds or would dismiss, saying compiling that information would impose a “significant burden” on staff.
Duberry referred comment about arrests to the Army, which told Source in a statement Friday morning that it would not speculate on charges that are awaiting adjudication,” said Joint Task Force Southern Border spokesperson Jordan Beagle. Beagle also noted that only the Border Patrol makes arrests, though the Army will temporarily detain people to hand over to the Border Patrol.

“The Joint Task Force Southern Border remains laser focused on our mission to achieve 100% operational control of the border, in this case maintaining security within the National Defense Areas,” he said, “which includes detection, temporary detainment, and apprehension of those who trespass within the National Defense Areas.”
The Border Patrol did not respond to a request for comment from Source on Thursday. 
According to court filings, two of the three people feds dropped charges againt were arrested April 26 about “four miles east of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry.” Outside of the 60-foot buffer zone along the border, that’s roughly a mile from Mount Cristo Rey and other privately owned land. Source’s calls to the Diocese this week were not returned.
The third arrest occurred April 27, according to court filings, “about eight miles west of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry.” 
Federal judge dismisses trespass charges against migrants caught in NM military zone

All three criminal complaints note, as part of the justification for charges, that signs were posted in English and Spanish that “this is a restricted area and that unauthorized entry is prohibited.”
The impact of those dismissals on prosecutors’ cases remains unclear. Even though prosecutors dismissed the trio’s charges for unauthorized NDA entry, each appears to still be held in detention on related misdemeanors, including charges like “illegal entry by an alien” into the United States, “illegal entry without inspection” or entering military property, according to court records. 
Amanda Skinner, assistant federal public defender, declined to comment on how many of her office’s clients might have been affected by the dismissals, or whether she is expecting there to be any more. 
Heinrich, through his spokesperson, said he remains concerned about what the military takeover of the New Mexico border will mean for due process, for citizens and non-citizens alike. 
“The Trump Administration is bypassing due process for individuals who either intentionally or unintentionally enter this newly restricted area, including U.S. citizens who may be stopped and detained by U.S. Army soldiers for trespassing on an unmarked military base,” his spokesperson said. 
Back at the ranch
One group affected by the NDA — ranchers — has apparently reached a slightly uneasy, informal arrangement with the Army, according to ranchers along the border and the New Mexico Cattlegrowers Association.
In the last two weeks, Army and Border Patrol officials have collected the names, photographs, phone numbers, license plates and other details of ranchers who enter the NDA to round up their livestock or check on water tanks, ranchers told Source New Mexico. 
The collection is an effort, they said, to make sure  the Army does not mistake ranchers, who often carry firearms, for those who might be trespassing on a military base.

“Everybody around here in this part of the country is armed,” said Nancy Clopton, a longtime Hachita rancher with 80 square miles of leased pasture in and around the NDA. “I don’t want to be drug out of my pickup and then, you know, ‘Oh, she’s armed.’”
The agreement allows ranchers to drive along access roads and county roads criss-crossing the NDA. Each time, they drive over cattleguards with new signs on either side that begin with, in English and Spanish: “Restricted Area: This Department of Defense Property has been declared a restricted area by authority of the commander.” 
About a dozen such signs are posted on cattleguards off Highway 9 between Sunland Park and Hachita, according to Source’s count Sunday. Those are the same signs prosecutors use to justify criminal charges against the 550 defendants facing the unauthorized entry charges so far.

In response to questions from Source, Luis Soriano, Heinrich’s spokesperson, noted that Ellison and Hegseth have both publicly said there will be “no exceptions” for criminal trespassing in the area, and so Heinrich doesn’t consider an “informal, handshake deal sufficient to ensure the safety” of ranchers, sportsmen, hikers or others.
“For decades, ranchers and hunters alike have been accustomed to carrying firearms on what were their public lands until the transfer to the Department of Defense on April 15th,” Soriano said in a statement. “That history, combined with the complete lack of clarity from the Administration, is a recipe for a very dangerous situation for our local residents, Army soldiers and Border Patrol agents.”
Beagle, with the Army, told Source in a statement to Friday that the army is continuing to work on a formal “memorandum of understanding” with various groups to “support the interests of the local community and the military mission within the New Mexico National Defense Area (NDA).”

“The MOU process for commercial and recreational activities, such as hunting, mining, and ranching, is complex,” he said “and necessitates careful coordination with multiple organizations to ensure that proposed activities do not compromise public safety and border security operations.”
Beagle also said the Army would release more information to the community as it becomes available. He also noted the land order that enabled the transfer was “subject to valid existing rights,” so he said the private “property owners” with land adjacent to the NDA would not be affected. But he did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how that applies to ranchers who lease, not own, land in the area. 
Bronson Corn, president of the NM Cattlegrowers Association, defended the arrangement in an interview with Source on Thursday. 
He disagrees with the idea that ranchers might be skirting the law, saying, albeit informal, the agreement allows ranchers to keep their cattle alive and maintain their leases with the BLM, while also allowing the Army to harden the border. 
“They have not had any conflicts with the military when it comes to being able to continue on with their day-to-day operations,” he said. “There is some concern, there’s no doubt about it, that they can’t get to certain areas of their ranch due to the fact of that militarized zone.”
In addition to concerns about firearms, Clopton said she is concerned an influx of army personnel, potentially from out-of-state, won’t be careful to close cattle gates behind them, which is a long-standing gripe she and other ranchers have with the Border Patrol. But she is withholding judgment, for now. 
“We’ll see how it works out,” she said. “It depends on the individuals on the ground, those individual soldiers, how they treat us, how we see them. It’s an experiment.”

(Karen Kasmauski | Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s administration has reversed course on a plan to close more than 30 mine safety offices, something union leaders and advocates said would compromise inspectors’ ability to protect coal miner’s lives.
Leases of the office, which employ coal mine inspectors, were set to end this summer along with several other federal offices under a plan by the Department of Government Efficiency.
A spokesperson for the Department of Labor confirmed Thursday that 34 Mine Safety and Health Adminsitration offices will be retained. They said the agency “has been working closely with [the General Services Administration] to ensure our MSHA inspectors have the resources they need to carry out their core mission to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthy workplaces for American miners.”
The reversal comes amid a push back from the Black Lung Association, the United Mine Workers of America, and others on what advocates called the Trump administration’s “attacks on coal miner safety.” In April, workers at the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety were put on administrative leave due to “reorganizations” at the federal level. 
According to an analysis from the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, the MSHA offices that were slated to close performed more than 16,600 safety and health inspections — with more than 230 of those done in West Virginia — between February 2024 and 2025.
Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered workers from NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division back to work, ending a reduction in force that prevented coal miners with black lung disease from having the option to transfer to less dusty areas of the mine to prevent further illness and injury.
MSHA had delayed the implementation of a new silica rule aimed at protecting coal miners from the dust that causes black lung disease. The rule was set to be effective in April but will now be effective in August. 
“I’m happy they’re going to keep these MSHA offices open,” Gary Hairston, president of the National Black Lung Association, said in a news release. “We need these offices that are close to the mines so that MSHA can conduct safety inspections and respond to accidents in a timely way. Now we need MSHA to enforce the new silica rule, and we need Congress to give MSHA enough funding to do its job.”
In a statement Friday, the United Mine Workers of America, a labor union representing coal miners, said the organization is relieved by the decision but called on the Department of Labor to be transparent about which offices remain are still at risk, and to stop remaining efforts to reduce the government’s mine safety infrastructure.
“The idea that anyone would even consider shuttering dozens of MSHA field offices, most of which are located in remote mining communities, shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what it takes to keep miners safe,” UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts said in the statement. “We’ve said from day one that cutting these offices would compromise inspectors’ ability to respond quickly to accidents, enforce safety regulations, and protect the lives of our members and their coworkers.”
In a statement Friday, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, and chair of the Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, said she was glad to hear that many of West Virginia’s MSHA offices will remain open. 
“I have raised this issue directly with [Department of Labor] Secretary [Lori] Chavez-DeRemer because I was concerned about the impact these closures could have on mine safety and workers’ access to support,” Capito said. “Keeping these offices open is the right decision — and a win for miners, inspectors, and the communities they serve.”

DemasEnbridge Energy’s controversial Line 5 tunnel project will move forward to a 30-day public comment period after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Friday released a draft environmental impact statement, which did not clear the project of all and potentially significant environmental concerns raised by activists and lawmakers opposed to the pipeline and its proposed tunnel.
The proposed plan is to construct a 3.6 mile tunnel under the lakebed of the Straits of Mackinac that would house a replacement segment of Line 5. The pipeline consists of two 20-inch diameter pipes that are buried in sediment near the shore and rest on, or are anchored to, the lakebed of the Stratis, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said.
Enbridge’s aim is to have that tunnel approved for permitting by the federal government through the Army Corp’s review process. It is their preferred alternative to no action from the Corps, which the company has said could result in less environmental security and certainty. Other alternatives include bolstering the tunnel with protective materials or the decommissioning of the pipeline altogether, which is what Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel set out to do shortly after they entered office in 2018.
Enbridge called the release of the impact statement and opening the public comment period a significant milestone for the project.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“It is the result of more than five years of rigorous and comprehensive permit review and stakeholder engagement including input from Tribes and is a critical step forward in planning a project that will modernize energy infrastructure, protect the Great Lakes, and ensure long-term energy reliability for Michigan and the broader region,” said Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy. “We appreciate the extensive technical work that went into this document and the opportunity to contribute detailed responses to numerous data and information requests – demonstrating our commitment to transparency and environmental, social and cultural responsibility.”
Duffy added that it was Enbridge’s goal for the proposed tunnel and the existing line to have “the smallest possible environmental footprint.”
“The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the [impact statement] to further refine the project,” he said.











Some activists who have fought against the continued operation of the line said this week that more work was needed to prevent the project from moving forward, while others said were disappointed in the state’s efforts to shut down Line 5.











Andrea Pierce, founder of the Michigan Anishinaabek caucus and policy director at the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, said Michigan needed to have good, clean, safe water for them to drink, to fish, to hunt, to gather. Those were also the hallmarks of the treaty rights granted to Tribes in Michigan.
Pierce was critical of Whitmer’s actions thus far.
“Governor Whitmer has done some things. She has [attempted to] shut them down. She revoked their easement. But that’s it,” Pierce said. “What else is being done? It’s operating illegally. That pipeline for years now [has been] operating illegally. They’re still making a profit off of us, off of Michigan citizens. They are making a profit, these Canadian companies, that needs to stop.”
Enbridge initially filed to apply for permits to build the tunnel in April 2020. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been working on the draft economic statement since then. In April, the Corps said its evaluation would move forward on a shortened timeline following an executive order from President Donald Trump.

Meanwhile, the existence of Line 5 and its continued operation has been fought out in a winding legal battle that remains active even as the project hit a milestone of forward progress on Friday.
Public comment on the project will end on June 30. Virtual public meetings are scheduled for June 18 and June 25, and comments will be collected online or through written submissions, which can be mailed to 6501 Shady Grove Road, P.O. Box 10178, Gaithersburg, MD 20898.
The impact statement released Friday factored in many rounds of previous public comment and input from Tribal organizations, as well as analysis of the project plans and potential alternatives.
The upshot: Enbridge’s tunnel project could have numerous consequences for land ownership and land use, land and water-based recreation, water resources, area aesthetics and air quality, as well as biological, cultural and soil resources.
As to the cultural resources affected, construction and operation of the tunnel would have adverse effects on archaeological sites and an existing archaeological district. Each of the activities associated with construction were listed as events that would destroy archaeological resources within the project footprint.
Impacts to Tribal treaty rights were not noted in the report, but the Corps said those issues would be determined in its decision materials following the new round of public comment.
A change of land ownership might be necessary at certain laydown areas as Enbridge would have to purchase land within the sites or acquire temporary or permanent easements. 
Direct, long-term and permanent detrimental impacts were associated with the project, the Corps said, as it related to undeveloped forest land that would need to be transformed into industrial sites, permanently altering the geology along the proposed tunnel site.
Direct and detrimental effects to nearby recreational sites were noted due to the noise and aesthetic impacts of construction. Those impacts would likely end when construction was completed, however.
Groundwater could be affected, but aquifer testing along the tunnel alignment site showed the surrounding aquifer would recover in a matter of days following construction. There is, however, concern for the potential release of drilling fluids and other contaminants associated with onshore material storage and the use of heavy equipment.
That said, the Corps noted that those impacts would also end once construction ceased – but with a heavy caveat that the construction contractor would have to adhere to a spill plan and monitor onsite and nearby well water for up to two years following completion.
To that end, surface water could be greatly affected by the project, as it would disturb the Straits during the installation of a water intake pipe. Approximately 20,000 gallons of drilling fluid – consisting of water and bentonite – would be released. The features would be removed following construction.

The turbidity and sedimentation in the area would be affected on a limited basis in the work area, but direct and detrimental impacts were noted to surface water adjacent to the construction site due to erosion and sedimentation.
An adherence to mitigation measures as a part of any approved permits would alleviate some of those concerns, and any long-term increases in stormwater would be managed by a permanent stormwater system.
Again, the Corps noted detrimental impacts associated with the unintended release of contaminants like equipment fuel.
Vegetation and wildlife disturbances in the area were also listed as factors, the latter of which would come from blasting activities during site preparation and the presence of workers in wildlife areas. The loss of approximately eight acres of habitat for protected species was noted, which would require ongoing coordination with the federal government and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.
Air quality would also be disturbed during construction, and proposed ventilation fans would add to noise nuisance, but only on an intermittent basis. The possibility of harmful emissions were noted to be significantly higher with Enbridge’s proposed version of the tunnel project compared to an alternative that includes a gravel and protective rock cover.
The reliability of the tunnel and its safety assurances were also analyzed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, but the report noted that the possibility of a catastrophic anchor strike, which could potentially release oil into the Great Lakes, would be eliminated with the presence of a tunnel.
Decommissioning the line also carried some potential localized and short-term consequences, the Army Corps said.
Reactions to the project’s forward progress were mixed, at best.
Great Lakes Michigan Jobs – a business coalition composed of the Detroit Regional Chamber, the Grand Rapids Chamber, economic development organization InvestUP and the Upper Peninsula Construction Council – said in a joint statement issued Friday that they were ready to support the tunnel project as the public comment period commenced.
The group also said that it was time to grant the project its permits to build the tunnel.
“Line 5 is an important piece of energy infrastructure for the continent, providing Michiganders with critical light crude and propane extracted from Canada,” Brian Shoaf, vice president of Public Policy and Business Advocacy with the Detroit Regional Chamber, said in a statement. 
Josh Lunger, vice president of government affairs with the Grand Rapids Chamber, said the tunnel wasn’t just an energy project, it was a strategic infrastructure investment.
“Across the entire state, we count on Line 5. It powers our businesses, our job sites, and even our homes,” Lunger said in a statement. “The Army Corps has been reviewing permit applications for more than five years. It’s time to grant the permits.”

Those who have been opposed to the project have said for years that the pipeline is a danger to the Great Lakes and the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel project, in their view, would not alleviate the environmental concerns, but only stands to exacerbate them.
As lawmakers and business leaders met for the Detroit Regional Chamber Mackinac Policy Conference this week on Mackinac Island, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who gave a speech to the conference Thursday night, so too did activists gather to express concerns over Line 5.
Ahead of the governor’s annual speech, protesters marched through downtown Mackinac Island, where they planned to rally outside the Grand Hotel for a press conference denouncing the tunnel project. 
The protesters, however, were turned away at the bottom of the hill approaching the hotel by a person who said he was there on behalf of the hotel. The man informed the protesters that the sidewalks and roads leading to the hill were private property owned by the Grand Hotel. 
That did not deter the protesters from being heard, even as they were diverted away from the hotel.
“Governor Whitmer has stood up for the Great Lakes and all of us before, by revoking Line 5’s illegal easement, but her work isn’t done,” said Beth Wallace, the Great Lakes climate and energy director at the National Wildlife Federation. “Now, Enbridge wants to blast and drill through the Great Lakes for years just to extend [the] life of a pipeline that will soon reach 80 years old and has already spilled at least 35 times. Meanwhile, the Great Lakes business network and regional experts confirm the project is absolutely not needed,”
Wallace added that decommissioning Line 5 was “the only honorable path forward, and means we’re honoring treaties and public trust, supporting domestic energy supplies and alternatives, creating more jobs in decommissioning, avoiding noticeable price increases, and it’s important to notice we are paying for the tunnel.”
“Those price increases are going to happen in the rates that Enbridge is already setting,” Wallace said. “The proposed tunnel isn’t about safety or providing our communities with energy, it’s about Enbridge’s profits.”

As of Friday morning, the individuals were being held at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, according to a Friday press release from the Burlington-based migrant advocacy group the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project. “Five or so” of the individuals were carrying proof of their immigration status at the time of the incident and are being scheduled for release, the press release stated. The immigration status of the other detainees was not immediately clear. ICE did not immediately respond to VTDigger’s requests for comment. The episode marks the second mass-detainment incident in Vermont in as many months as federal immigration officials ramp up enforcement efforts across the country to carry out the policies of President Donald Trump. Last month, eight migrant workers were detained at a dairy farm in Berkshire after Customs and Border Protection agents responded to a call alleging that suspicious looking men had crossed onto the farm property. Four of those arrested have already been deported to Mexico, while others remain in ICE custody.The arrests correspond with what advocacy groups have said is an alarming increase of ICE’s use of commercial flights to transfer detainees out of the state. On Friday, in the latest such incident, ICE transferred seven women on a United Airlines flight from Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to Chicago, according to the release from the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project. The women, who had been detained at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, were observed on the flight among commercial passengers with a plainclothes federal escort, the release stated. Legal observers awaiting the arrival of the flight said the ICE detainees did not get off the plane in Chicago and the plane subsequently reboarded for a flight to Washington, D.C., according to the release.Former state Rep. Kiah Morris, who was apparently on the same flight, posted a video to social media in which she drew attention to the incident. “I have great concerns about the fact that this is happening and not certain on what we should be able to do as a public to really be able to really help support folks right now,” Morris said in the video. “(These are) some terrifying things to see happening right in front of our faces.”This story will be updatedRead the story on VTDigger here:  Immigration officials detain 10 construction workers in Newport.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP17044803991198-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-30 14:14:39.009948

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado immigrant rights advocates expressed outrage over the Thursday arrest of a family of three outside a federal immigration court in Denver, calling the tactic an escalation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers that will punish immigrants who comply with the law by attending their scheduled court hearings.
Emily Brock, an attorney with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, witnessed the arrest of the family, including a 1-year-old child, shortly after they attended their hearing at the Department of Justice’s Denver Immigration Court at 1961 Stout St. Six unidentified plainclothes officers surrounded the family, according to the Colorado Rapid Response Network, a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups. The officers refused to let Brock speak with the family about their rights before they were taken away.
“As a parent, I cannot imagine the terror these parents experienced as the officers surrounded them with their child in their arms and told them they were to go with them,” she said.

“As the officers got closer, the little boy’s arms clung tighter around his father’s neck,” Brock added. “To take enforcement action against a family following the rules, attending their proceedings, is an attack on due process and serves only to instigate increased levels of fear in the community.”
The arrest at a federal courthouse in Denver appears to be part of a nationwide policy shift by ICE as President Donald Trump’s administration moves to carry out unprecedented mass deportations of as many as 12 million immigrants in the U.S. who lack permanent legal status. Federal immigration agents have long avoided such arrests so as not to deter immigrants from going through lawful court proceedings.
But over the last week, an “aggressive new initiative” by ICE has abruptly reversed that policy, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times.
Christina Brown, an immigration attorney and founder of the Colorado Asylum Center, said that such a policy will force immigrant families to make an “impossible choice” — whether to “attend court and face possible arbitrary mandatory months-long detention, family separation and the prospect of arguing your case from inside detention, or not appear in court and face certain targeting for deportation by ICE.”
Denver’s ICE field office did not immediately respond to questions Friday about the arrest and where the family was being held. Colorado’s only immigrant detention center, in Aurora, is an adults-only facility. Under Trump, multiple ICE facilities across the country have been reopened for family detention, a practice that had largely ended under former President Joe Biden.
“Detaining an entire family — including a baby — after they did exactly what was asked of them shows how far ICE will go to punish people simply for trying to stay together and follow the law,” said Raquel Lane-Arellano, communications manager for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. “This is a deliberate attempt to scare our communities out of the courtroom and into the shadows. But we won’t back down — we will keep showing up for each other, demanding justice, and holding those in power accountable.”

(Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Thursday released a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions” it says “are deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities. Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in peril.”
DHS includes 23 of New Mexico’s 33 counties on its list, along with the cities of Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
The list follows President Donald Trump’s executive order in April requiring such a list. Following that executive order, City of Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber told Source the City of Santa Fe does not specifically identify itself as a sanctuary city and he did not think the order applied to the city. The City of Santa Fe passed a resolution in 1999, which was reaffirmed in 2017, declaring itself a welcoming city for immigrants and refugees.
“We treat everyone in our city the same: with respect and a welcoming attitude, regardless of a variety of factors including whether they’re here with documentation,” Webber said. “That continues to be our city policy.”
In a written statement provided to Source last month, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller last month emphasized that Trump’s executive order is counterproductive to addressing crime.”We remember when Trump tried to extort immigrant-friendly cities like ours before, but threatening to defund the police is the exact opposite of what Albuquerque needs to be safe,” Keller said. “Our communities are stronger when people of all backgrounds feel safe reporting crimes and working with police, and our officers will keep arresting anyone who breaks the law, regardless of their immigration status.”

“Each jurisdiction listed will receive formal notification of its non-compliance with Federal statutes,” the DHS stated in posting the list. “DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens.”
In response to the list, leaders from several civil rights and immigration organizations issued statements decrying its publication.
“New Mexico has a proud tradition of welcoming immigrants,” Lena Weber, interim policy director with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, said in a statement. “Immigrants and mixed-status families are integral to our communities. We talk a lot about public safety in this state—and we know that we are all safer when our families can go to school, work, and health centers without fear of being torn away from their loved ones.”
Sanctuary studies

Fabiola Landeros from El CENTRO de Igualdad y Derechos said in a statement that, “We are proud of the legacy we’ve built in New Mexico, including the passage of policies that promote public safety, safeguard civil rights, promote immigrant integration, and recognize the vast contributions of our immigrant communities. The Trump administration’s terrifying vision of mass deportation and family separation and their willingness to trample on constitutional rights and utilize illegal tactics is not only against New Mexican values, but it will also have a devastating impact on our communities and economy.”
Jessica Inez Martínez, director of policy and coalition building at New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, described “labeling sanctuary policies as ‘lawless insurrection’ is not only inflammatory—it is legally baseless and a reckless distortion of the rule of law.  At the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, we see every day how immigrant families are building lives rooted in care, resilience, and hope. They are our neighbors, coworkers, and caregivers—essential to the cultural and economic life of New Mexico.”

More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.

The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”

Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”

Keeping talent

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.

GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.

Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.

Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

Joni Ernst held a town hall at Aplington-Parkersburg High School in Parkersburg May 30, 2025. (Screenshot via C-SPAN)PARKERSBURG — At a sometime raucous town hall meeting Friday morning, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst faced vocal opposition on her support for spending cuts to programs such as Medicaid and SNAP.
Like many other Republican lawmakers holding events with constituents throughout the country, Ernst faced a crowd at the Aplington-Parkersburg High School who were upset with decisions made by President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress — particularly as they relate to funding for health care and food assistance programs included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House earlier in May.
Though Ernst said the Senate would make changes to the measure and advance their own version of the legislation, she defended reductions in spending for Medicaid at the town hall, saying the changes will not impact people in need but will remove from the program “illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits” and able-bodied adults who are not working.
“People will die,” a woman shouted at the stage as Ernst answered one of several questions about the cuts.
“People are not — well, we all are going to die, so for heaven’s sake,” Ernst said in a response that was met by further shouts and jeering from the crowd.
Ernst said she agrees with most of the provisions on Medicaid included in the House version of the budget reconciliation bill, saying that it was targeted at changes to the public health care program that “made it much easier to get onto Medicaid, but much tougher to take people off of Medicaid.” Ernst said many people on Medicaid currently are working full-time and have access to other benefits.
“What we have to do is make sure that those that are not eligible by the federal standard for Medicaid are not receiving Medicaid,” Ernst said. “What we do need to do is make sure that those that are part of a vulnerable population have access to Medicaid and receive those full benefits. So what we’re trying to do is strengthen Medicaid by directing the dollars to the people that actually meet the requirements of the program.”
It its House form, the bill includes a $625 billion reduction in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. It also includes 80-hour-per-month work requirements for people between ages 19 and 65 to continue receiving Medicaid health coverage, with several exceptions for people with disabilities and complex medical conditions, pregnant people, tribal community members and parents of dependent children.
Elizabeth Kehret, who works for Lutheran Services in Iowa, said she was troubled by the potential impact of Medicaid cuts for pregnant woman, saying that she was previously enrolled on Medicaid during her four pregnancies before the state revuised eligibility for postpartum coverage, changing it from families with incomes of 375% of the federal poverty line to those at 215% of the federal poverty line.
Kehret said she was concerned the federal Medicaid spending cuts would cause similar cuts for care in states across the country, meaning pregnant people, who may also have private health coverage, will struggle to pay for the medical care required both before and after their child is born.
“I heard you say earlier about people who work full time but still get Medicaid — yeah,” Kehret said. “I meet with dozens of women who have dual enrollment, where they have private insurance as well as Medicaid, and it helps cover the things that their private insurance doesn’t, or that high deductible. … Medicaid is extremely important to the smallest and most vulnerable population in Iowa.”
Ernst said there were provisions to allow continued Medicaid coverage for pregnant people in the House bill.
“Because you are part of that vulnerable population, we want to make sure that you have access to Medicaid,” Ernst said. “So you will hear examples of those like the able-bodied, 30-year-old man who is taking advantage of the program, not working. What we’re asking is that please engage in work activities, engage in volunteer activities, be enrolled in a training program, and then that makes you Medicaid eligible.”
Similar concerns were brought up about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, that provides food assistance to low-income individuals. Under the House budget plan, some costs of SNAP would be moved to the states, in addition to adding other work requirements. Ernst said the House bill is correcting “overpayments” from states on SNAP, in addition to removing “people that have not been eligible for these programs by law as it is currently written” from public assistance.
Several veterans also spoke at the event, criticizing Republicans and Elon Musk’s DOGE Service for cuts to veterans’ assistance programs and cuts to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. In response, Ernst said, “We’re not cutting veterans benefits.”
Several veterans have been outspoken about changes made by DOGE to the VA, including the cut of roughly 2,400 VA jobs in early March.
Ernst has been a major supporter of DOGE and efforts to make government more “efficient,” saying Republicans and Musk are focused on removing areas of unnecessary spending and “streamlining” existing programs and services. Ernst highlighted the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as an entity that can be made more efficient through DOGE efforts in response to a question on federal support following natural disasters.
“Department of Government Efficiency … the E is not about elimination, it is about efficiency,” Ernst said. “So how can we do better as a federal government to respond to the people on the ground?”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-30-at-11.27.38 AM-1024x592.png,,,2025-05-30 13:16:33.529064

The suit was filed Thursday in Douglas County District Court. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two physicians and three women are plaintiffs in a Kansas lawsuit challenging constitutionality of a state law invalidating advance medical directives outlining end-of-life treatment for pregnant patients.
The group’s lawsuit seeks to prohibit enforcement of a Kansas statute interfering with health care decisions outlined in living wills based exclusively on an individual’s pregnancy status. Kansas is among states permitting state interference in advance directives for pregnant patients, regardless of the gestational age of a fetus, when a person was incapacitated or terminally ill.
Issues surrounding end-of-life state law recently took on urgency as a brain-dead pregnant Georgia woman was placed on life support in deference to that state’s abortion ban.
Kansas patient plaintiffs Emma Vernon, Abigail Ottaway and Laura Stratton as well as Kansas physician plaintiffs Michele Bennett and Lynley Holman argued in the Douglas County District Court complaint filed Thursday the Kansas law violated rights of personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment and freedom of speech under the Kansas Constitution’s Bill of Rights by disregarding clearly articulated end-of-life choices of pregnant people.
“Because I’m currently pregnant, I don’t get the peace of mind a living will is meant to provide,” said Vernon, a Lawrence resident who is pregnant. “I shouldn’t have to fear that my pregnancy could cost me my dignity and autonomy.”
Vernon said she outlined in a living will the medical care she would want if faced with a life-threatening condition, but Kansas’ law meant she wouldn’t have control over her end-of-life care while pregnant.
“I am no less capable of planning my medical care simply because I am pregnant. I know what is best for me,” she said.
Many states established a boundary for medical directives of pregnant individuals no longer capable of participating in end-of-life care in terms of the viability of a fetus. Kansas’ statute invalidated decision-making authority of pregnant women regardless of gestational development of a fetus.
Holman, a Lawrence physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, said responsibilities of health care professionals should be centered on honoring patients’ autonomy and privacy.
“When a law compels me to act against my patients’ clearly expressed decisions, it not only undermines the trust at the heart of the patient-provider relationship, but also threatens the ethical foundation of medical care,” Holman said.
Defendants in the Kansas lawsuit are Kris Kobach, the state attorney general; Richard Bradbury, president of the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts; and Dakota Loomis, district attorney in Douglas County. The lawsuit seeks to prevent Kobach and Bradbury from enforcing state law nullifying directives of pregnant women.
The case was filed by attorneys with Compassion & Choices, a Colorado nonprofit working to improve patient autonomy at the end of life; If/When/How, a California reproductive rights legal nonprofit; and the Topeka law firm of Irigonegaray & Revenaugh.
Attorney Pedro Irigonegaray said Kansans valued individual rights and personal freedoms, but the state’s pregnancy exclusion “betrays those values by denying pregnant people the right to control their own medical decisions.”
“Our plaintiffs are simply asking for the same fundamental rights the Kansas Constitution guarantees to all Kansans,” said Jess Pezley, senior staff attorney at Compassion & Choices. “Categorically stripping individuals of their right to make deeply personal end-of-life decisions because they are pregnant is not only offensive, it’s fundamentally at odds with the values enshrined in the Kansas Constitution.”
The lawsuit says Kansas law “unjustly, discriminatorily and categorically disregards” the clearly expressed end-of-life decisions of pregnant women.
The women plaintiffs asked the district court to “affirm that the protections guaranteed by the Kansas Constitution apply equally to them and ensure that their most personal end-of-life decisions will be respected regardless of their pregnancy status.”
In addition, the petition says the physician plaintiffs were “deeply committed to the foundational medical principle that patients have a fundamental right to determine what treatment they receive, and that providing treatment without a patient’s informed consent violates both medical ethics and the law.”
“Yet, Kansas law compels them to disregard their patients’ clearly expressed end-of-life decisions, forcing them to provide their pregnant patients with a lower standard of care than any of their other patients receive,” the petition said. “It demands this diminished care without offering any clarity on what end-of-life treatment they are required to provide — leaving them to guess at what the law expects while exposing them to civil, criminal and professional consequences for getting it wrong.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pregnancy-end-of-life-lawsuit-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 13:16:33.529064

SPRINGFIELD — A bill that seeks to control the rising cost of prescription drugs while also offering financial help for many small, independent pharmacies in Illinois cleared the state Senate on Thursday and awaits action in the House.

The bill, known as the Prescription Drug Affordability Act, contained in House Bill 1697, would put new regulations and impose new fees on a large but little understood segment of the prescription drug industry — pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.

“This really restricts the ability of PBMs to extract large amounts of money out of the prescription drug system,” Sen. Dave Koehler, D-Peoria, the bill’s chief Senate sponsor, said in an interview.

PBMs act as a kind of third-party intermediary in the insurance industry who manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of insurance plans. They do that by negotiating prices with drug manufacturers, setting reimbursement rates paid to pharmacies, developing formularies, or “preferred drug lists,” and maintaining pharmacy networks where insured individuals get their prescriptions filled.

But they have also come under criticism in recent years for being too closely integrated with some of the nation’s largest retail pharmacy chains and for helping drive up the cost of prescription drugs, often at the expense of smaller, independent community pharmacies.

“They extract extra profit from patients through opaque and often predatory tactics,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in calling for the legislation during his State of the State address in February. “Not only are they driving up health care costs for Illinois families by hundreds of millions of dollars per year, but they are also putting small, local, independent pharmacies out of business.”

Many large PBMs, such as CVS Caremark, a subsidiary of CVS Health, also either own or are affiliated with large retail chain pharmacies. Critics of their practices argue they use their position to steer patients to their own pharmacies, often to the detriment of smaller, independent pharmacies. That has resulted in what some people call “pharmacy deserts” in many small towns, rural areas and low-income urban communities.

“PBMs routinely reimburse my pharmacy below cost for brand name prescriptions, medications where they're already pocketing massive rebates from drug manufacturers,” David Bagot, an independent pharmacist from Petersburg who is also president of the Illinois Pharmacists Association, told a Senate committee Wednesday. “Meanwhile, they pay their own affiliated pharmacies – including PBM-owned community, mail-order and specialty pharmacies – much higher rates for the same medications.”

The bill would prohibit PBMs from “steering” insured patients to their own affiliated pharmacies, either by requiring them to use a particular pharmacy or by forcing the patient to pay more for their medications if they use a different outlet.

It would also prohibit the practice of “spread pricing,” or charging an insurance plan one price for a given drug while reimbursing pharmacies at a lower rate for that same drug and pocketing the difference.

In addition, the bill calls for levying a fee on PBMs based on the number of patients they insure. Money from that fee would go into a fund for the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to award up to $25 million a year in grants to independent pharmacies and pharmacies located in rural counties, medically underserved areas, low-income communities and pharmacies that serve high concentrations of Medicaid patients.

It also would require PBMs to remit all the money they receive in the form of rebates from drug manufacturers to the insurance plan sponsors. And it would require them to disclose to state regulators how much they receive in rebates each year.

Pharmaceutical industry lobbyists argued many provisions of the bill, including the fee levied on PBMs, will actually end up being passed on to insurance plans and consumers, thus resulting in higher prescription drug prices.

“This is not a prescription drug affordability bill,” said Lori Reimers, lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association. “Costs will rise. When you give more money to pharmacies, when you restrict tools that lower cost, the cost of insurance and health plans are going to go up on your constituents.”

Reimers noted that since 2016, Illinois lawmakers have enacted 20 new laws pertaining to PBMs including laws granting the state Department of Insurance regulatory powers over PBMs, all with the intent of bringing down drug prices.

“And I don't think anybody's here saying that drug prices have gotten lower yet,” she said. “But here we are with a much bigger bill.”

The bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support, 56-1. Sen. Dave Syverson, R-Cherry Valley, cast the only no vote.

The language the Senate passed was an amendment to a House bill that originally dealt with training for 911 dispatchers. The bill now goes back to the House for concurrence with the Sente amendments.

Reimers noted that since 2016, Illinois lawmakers have enacted 20 new laws pertaining to PBMs including laws granting the state Department of Insurance regulatory powers over PBMs, all with the intent of bringing down drug prices.

“And I don't think anybody's here saying that drug prices have gotten lower yet,” she said. “But here we are with a much bigger bill.”

The bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support, 56-1. Sen. Dave Syverson, R-Cherry Valley, cast the only no vote.

The language the Senate passed was an amendment to a House bill that originally dealt with training for 911 dispatchers. The bill now goes back to the House for concurrence with the Sente amendments.

In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.
But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

When that same energy is directed toward policy and people, toward justice and equity, history can be made.","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here. 

When Mississippi’s own Jamal Roberts captured the crown as American Idol’s newest star, it wasn’t just a personal victory. It was a collective affirmation.
Roberts won with the largest vote total in the show’s history, fueled by millions of votes from fans who believed in his voice. People voted from their phones, laptops and tablets, some casting multiple votes in one night. The results were immediate, visible and powerful.
It was a vivid demonstration of the power of participation. But it also highlighted a profound contrast: in civic life, particularly in Mississippi, voter turnout remains inconsistent — and for many, impossible.
Mississippi still has some of the harshest felony disenfranchisement laws in the nation. People who have served their time remain barred from the ballot box unless they obtain a pardon or have their rights restored through an arduous legislative process that rarely grants relief. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, over 200,000 Mississippians are disenfranchised, and many of them are Black — a legacy of Jim Crow that continues to define who gets to fully participate in democracy.

Roberts’ win demonstrates what’s possible when people are moved to act. Imagine that same energy channeled into local, state and federal elections. Imagine Mississippians casting ballots not only for a singer but for their children’s schools, their community hospitals, their roads, water systems and criminal justice policies.
But unlike reality television, the results of voting in a democracy aren’t immediate. Votes cast in August may not change policies by September. Ballots mailed in November may not yield results until months later. Democracy is not designed for instant gratification. It is designed for lasting transformation. That requires patience, persistence and most importantly, participation.
History is rich with examples of what sustained, organized civic action can accomplish.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) began with a single mother whose daughter was killed by a drunk driver. She organized. She lobbied, and she galvanized others into action. Today, thanks to their advocacy, all 50 states have laws that criminalize drunk driving with legal blood alcohol limits, and thousands of lives are saved each year. Change didn’t happen overnight. It happened because people voted, lobbied and stayed engaged.
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids launched a decades-long effort to reduce youth smoking. They mobilized parents, teachers, doctors and young people themselves. Through a combination of public education, local ordinances and federal action, youth smoking has declined dramatically in the U.S.
The Fight for $15 movement, led by low-wage workers demanding a livable wage, began with walkouts and was once considered a political longshot. Today, it has reshaped local economies across the country, resulting in minimum wage increases in cities, counties and states, and is influencing federal policy discussions.
These examples all underscore a key truth: showing up to the polls may not produce the kind of instant results seen in a televised competition, but it is a necessary step toward durable change. Policy requires organizing, coalition-building and a long-game mindset. It involves “We the People” and that includes returning citizens, low-income families, rural voters, young people and everyone in between.
Mississippi has a storied history of both voter suppression and voter courage. From Fannie Lou Hamer to the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, the fight to vote has always been met with resistance but also with resilience. Today, that fight continues, especially for those silenced by a criminal legal system designed to exclude.
The good news is that the blueprint is clear. Vote like Jamal Roberts is counting on it. But also vote like your child’s school lunch depends on it. Like your access to clean water depends on it. Like your loved one’s right to return home from prison and fully participate in society depends on it — because it does.
Whether in-person or absentee, whether at the courthouse or by mail, casting a ballot is a statement of presence. Even when the results aren’t immediate, the act itself is cumulative. It builds pressure. It signals demand. It creates momentum.
Let Jamal Roberts’ victory be more than a moment of celebration — let it be a mirror. Mississippians have already proven the ability to mobilize in historic numbers, helping drive more than 26 million votes to secure Roberts’ win. That level of engagement doesn’t belong solely to the world of entertainment. It belongs to democracy. When that same energy is directed toward policy and people, toward justice and equity, history is not just watched — it’s made.
As Mississippi approaches Election Day on Tuesday, the opportunity to act is here. Let this be a fresh start. The same spirit that voted for Jamal Roberts can show up at the ballot box — whether early, absentee or in-person. Let Mississippi once again show up and show out — not just for a voice on stage, but for the voices in our communities who deserve to be heard, counted and valued.

(Photo provided by Volvo Cars)Volvo Cars has halted production at its Lowcountry plant because of a parts shortage, highlighting the growing supply chain issues automakers nationwide are experiencing in the wake of President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs.
Volvo, which builds the all-electric EX90 sport-utility vehicle at its $1.2 billion plant in Ridgeville, did not immediately specify the parts involved or say how long the shutdown announced Thursday is expected to last.
The carmaker is working with suppliers to resolve the problem and get the factory off Interstate 26 up and running again, according to news reports.
The shutdown comes on the heels of Volvo announcing layoffs affecting 5% of the plant’s workers, or roughly 100 people, and a global workforce reduction of 3,000 employees, most of them at the automaker’s Sweden headquarters.
The layoffs are part of nearly $2 billion in cost reductions Volvo is undertaking as tariffs have roiled global trade.
The EX90, with a list price of $79,995, is the only vehicle Volvo builds at its South Carolina factory.
The company has said it may add production of other vehicles at the Lowcountry site to offset tariffs on imported vehicles, which make up most of Volvo’s most popular sellers in the United States.
The EX90 is the flagship model in Volvo’s pledge to build an all-electric lineup, but its sales have lagged far behind the brand’s other gas-powered and hybrid models.
Through April, Volvo sold 4,051 EX90s worldwide compared with sales topping 80,293 for its most popular XC60 mid-sized SUV.
All told, EX90 sales have made up about 1.8% of Volvo’s 231,100 global sales through April.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Members of the Legislative Education Study Committee voiced concerns this week about the tight deadline the New Mexico Public Education Department has to meet new court orders in the longstanding lawsuit concerning equitable public education.
The LESC met for the first time during the interim Thursday and received an update on the Yazzie/Martinez lawsuit. Parties in the case returned to court last month to consider a motion of non-compliance filed by the plaintiffs in September 2024. First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson agreed with the plaintiffs that the PED has not complied with previous court orders and ruled the state needs to produce a plan for providing equitable education for at-risk students and tracking progress.
According to court documents, the PED must identify an outside expert to assist with the development of the plan and file a status report by July 1. A draft plan must be filed with the court by Oct. 1 and a final plan must be available for review by the court by Nov. 3. 
Lawmakers questioned PED representatives about the court order and whether the department will be able to meet Wilson’s timeline.
“We are going to do whatever it takes to meet these deadlines,” PED Sec. Mariana Padilla told committee members. “We are not starting from scratch…we have so much ready to build upon, which is why I feel that this is doable. Is it going to be difficult? Absolutely.”
PED Assistant Secretary of Policy and Technology Greg Frostad told lawmakers that the department is currently working to identify an outside expert “as quickly as possible.”
Rep. Patricia Roybal Caballero (D-Albuquerque) encouraged Padilla to take into consideration the voices of stakeholders from outside the PED, including advocacy organizations and the plaintiffs in the suit. She also asked Padilla to use the plaintiff’s motion as a guide when implementing the plan because it outlined nine primary goals for creating a multicultural and multilingual educational framework; an education workforce; increasing technology access; developing methods of accountability; and strengthening the capacity of the PED.
“We’re too programmed,” Roybal Caballero said during the meeting. “It takes a great deal of resolve…and commitment to say, ‘I’m going to take that bold leap and step outside of what I’m familiar with.’ Trust the experts that come from our state of New Mexico, the experts that have been delivering this core education to our students, despite or in spite of PED, and trust that what they said and stated and presented in the plaintiff’s motion is valuable.”
President Pro Tempore Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) said she agreed with her colleague’s sentiments, but added that she believes the PED “has stepped up in a huge way” to address the court’s original findings in the suit: that the state was not providing Native students, English language learners, low-income students and students with disabilities equitable education they constitutionally have a right to. 
“I’ll say that I think part of our issue is that we lost our first judge. [The late] Judge [Sarah] Singleton listened to this for years and ruled, and I believe that she kind of understood where the problems were. But she’s no longer with us, and that has, I think, produced all of this lack of focus for all of us,” Stewart said. “I think this is a much bigger picture and I like the idea of an outside expert that will come in and look at everything we’ve done…Because we’ve not been doing nothing; we’ve been doing a lot.”

A Georgia Public Service Commission candidate will remain on the Democratic primary ballot after appealing a decision this week disqualifying him from the race for failing to meet residency requirements.
A Fulton County Superior Court hearing is scheduled for June 10 when Chief Judge Ural Glanville will hear arguments on PSC candidate Daniel Blackman’s appeal. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger had affirmed a state court judge’s ruling that Blackman was unable to provide evidence that a Fulton County property is his primary domicile.
Blackman is a candidate for District 3, which includes Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties. Commissioners are elected statewide but must be residents of a given district for at least 12 months.
Blackman served as the Environmental Protection Agency’s Southeast regional administrator under the Biden administration, and he’s a former PSC candidate who came close to winning a seat on the commission back in 2020.
Blackman’s lawyer, Matthew Wilson, said Blackman’s name will remain on ballots after Glanville granted an injunction Thursday.
“Once we’re given the opportunity for a fair hearing, I’m confident that Daniel will prevail because all of the facts and all of the law are on his side,” Wilson said Friday.
The complaint against Blackman was filed by Atlanta resident Rodney Stephens, who currently resides in a home previously owned by another Democratic candidate, Keisha Waites, according to online county property records.
Stephens and Waites declined to comment about the residency challenge.
The residency dispute involves a one-bedroom dwelling in Atlanta that Blackman leased on Oct. 4, 2024. Blackman testified that he purchased the property to live closer to work while his wife and children continued to reside in their Forsyth County home north of Atlanta, according to the 12-page ruling.
The state court judge wrote that Blackman failed to provide evidence that he actually lived in the home, such as utility bills or mail being delivered to the Atlanta address.
Early voting for two PSC seats began Tuesday with Blackman’s name on ballots statewide. If Blackman’s ban is permanent, notices will be placed in polling places advising voters of his disqualification and votes cast for him will not be counted, Raffensperger’s office said. Election Day is June 17.
Three other Democrats appear on the District 3 PSC ballot: Waites, a former Atlanta City Council member and ex-state representative; Peter Hubbard, founder of the clean nonprofit Center for Energy Solutions, and Robert Jones, a former utility executive. The winner will face GOP incumbent Fitz Johnson in the Nov. 4 general election. Johnson was appointed to the seat by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021.
Jones said Friday he would like to see an expedited final decision in the Blackman case so candidates can focus solely on their own campaigns without having to deal with the distraction.
“The appeal filed Wednesday was another surprise in a race that has had too many,” Jones said.

(Photo courtesy of the Thrasher family)Former House Speaker and Florida State University President John Thrasher died Friday, a month after announcing a cancer diagnosis. 
Thrasher was president of FSU from 2014 through 2021, the culmination of a lengthy legislative career that began with him lobbying for the Florida Medical Association and eventually led him to serve in both chambers of the Florida Legislature. 
He served in the Florida Senate, starting in 2009 and leaving in 2014, and in the Florida House for eight years, starting in 1992 and terming out in 2000. Thrasher was speaker of the chamber for his last two years. 
On Aug. 19, FSU’s campus will host Thrasher’s celebration of life in the Ruby Diamond Concert Hall. The family plans a private burial in Orange Park for Thrasher.
“John lived a remarkable life — and he made a big difference in the lives of so many in our state,” Gov. Ron DeSantis posted to X. 
Thrasher was an alumnus of the school he led, earning his bachelor’s and law degrees from FSU. In between the two degrees, he served in the U.S. Army and received two Bronze Stars for his service in Vietnam and the Army Commendation Medal in Germany. 
Florida Board of Governors Vice Chair Alan Levine, who served on the board during Thrasher’s presidency, spoke to Thrasher’s legacy in a text message to the Phoenix.
“Florida lost a giant, today. From his leadership and support of his beloved FSU to every issue important to Florida, John led with integrity,” Levine wrote. “My prayers are with my friends in Tallahassee and with those who’ve known John, because this one hurts, and a lot of good people are in pain today. Rest Peacefully, John. Your work here may be done, but your legacy will never be forgotten.”

The Southern Group, the lobbying firm Thrasher co-founded, announced on April 22 that the former president was receiving treatment for cancer at Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare. 
After retiring as FSU president, Thrasher returned to The Southern Group in 2021 and served on the faculty of the FSU College of Law. 
Thrasher was chair of the Republican Party of Florida for a year in 2010 and 2011. 
“John Thrasher was a mentor, a patriot, and a man of integrity. His faith never wavered, his principles never faltered, and his love for this state was unmatched,” RPOF Chairman Evan Power said in a news release, adding that Thrasher “unified and stabilized” the party during his stint as chairman. 
Thrasher also served on the Clay County School Board and as the first chair of the FSU Board of Trustees. 
“From the battlefields of Vietnam where he returned as a highly decorated officer, to years of honorable service as Speaker of the House, Rules Chair of the Senate, and President of Florida State University, John was regarded by all as a strong, fair leader with unquestionable judgment, timeless principles of honor, and a gentleman all the way through,” Senate President Ben Albritton wrote in a letter Friday to sitting senators, announcing Thrasher’s death.
‘Student success’
FSU credits Thrasher for “substantial investments in student success initiatives,” increased graduate enrollment, and milestones in faculty hiring and research funding. 
Thrasher’s successor at FSU, President Richard McCullough, said he and his wife will “always remember the kindness” Thrasher and his wife, Jean, extended when he became president. “They made it their mission to help us feel at home in Tallahassee,” McCullough wrote in a statement posted to social media.
“John had a remarkable ability to bring people together with his warmth, humor, and unmistakable charm,” McCullough wrote.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried joined the outpouring of condolences on social media. 
“While we cheered for different teams, politically and collegially, he never let that impact our friendship. He was a great leader, true public servant and a terrific human being. RIP,” Fried posted to X. 
Florida Sen. Shevrin Jones called Thrasher “a good one” and “a true statesman, and a good man.”
FSU football alum and Florida Sen. Corey Simon said he is “deeply saddened,” also calling Thrasher “a true statesman.”
“John was a champion for FSU and served Florida and his country with honor. His legacy of service and commitment to education will live on for generations,” U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis posted to X. 
“The Lion of the Senate has passed. John Thrasher was a great mentor and friend. He fought the good fight. His legacy will continue on for generations,” Thrasher’s former Senate colleague, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, posted to X.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas House Democrats opened their “fight back” tour Thursday night in the capital city, drawing more than 220 people to sit through rain showers and talk about the importance of strengthening their party’s voice in upcoming elections.
“There’s a lot to lose, so we have a lot to fight for,” said Carla Gardner, of Lawrence, as she waited in line to get into the event. “It’s sad that in 2025 we feel we have to fight back. But a lot of, well, women, potentially, could lose, the LGBTQ+ community, health care, veterans — there are just so many groups, people of color, just all the marginalized groups, that stand to lose a lot more. We have to fight back.”
Linda Manley and Sarah Ruiz, both of Topeka, said they attended the rally because they feel the need to get involved more at the local level after watching national news.
Why did they come listen to Democrats in the rain?
“The chaos in the world and trying to find out what we can do,” Ruiz said.
“Loss of our Constitution, loss of our courts, checks and balances — I know it needs to start locally,” Manley added.
Their words were echoed by many of the House Democrats in attendance, as well as Gov. Laura Kelly, who spoke briefly at the event.
“This was exactly the right response to what happened in November of 2024, in this last legislative session,” she said. “We need to be out there now and forever, leading up to the August 2026 primary when, in addition to electing candidates, we also have to make sure that we defeat that amendment to elect our Supreme Court justices.”
Kelly referred to a proposed constitutional amendment that would put Kansas Supreme Court justices on the ballot, instead of the governor appointing one of three finalists selected by a nonpartisan review panel.
“I don’t know about you, but I have no interest in being like Wisconsin on this where there are millions and millions of dollars coming into that state to sway the one group that is supposed to be impartial and not motivated by political leanings,” the governor said.
Kelly encouraged everyone in attendance to “learn to speak Republican” and talk to people throughout the state.
“Talk about the issues that matter to people, and talk about electing a person, not a party,” she said.

Rep. Susan Ruiz, before the event started, emphasized that same message. The Shawnee Democrat said anyone paying attention to what happened in the Legislature during the recent session should be concerned.
A more collaborative relationship is needed in the Statehouse to push forward things Kansans care about, she said.
“I want to see more Democrats running and winning so that we can have a fighting chance,” she said, referring to the Republicans’ supermajority. “But it would be nice to see some moderate Republicans also win because we can band together. There’s a lot of things that we can do together that would be good for the majority of the people in the state, and not the Koch brothers of the world.”
Rep. Kirk Haskins, a Topeka Democrat, said before speaking at the event that the fight back tour, which will go to at least 11 more stops throughout the state, is important to get messaging out for the Democrats.
“There’s a lot of Kansans that have had their opinion not heard,” he said. “For example, 80% of Kansans want us to see some sort of expansion of Medicaid, but yet it doesn’t come up. We also feel like it’s time for the House Democrats to lead the opportunity for them to be heard, and so we’re traveling across with an agenda purpose to share what’s happening, but also to learn, not just from Democrats, but from all Kansans.”
Haskins said he’s been concerned about how business is being conducted at the Statehouse, and also what is happening at the federal level. Important items are buried in details, for instance. 
“We saw this during the past session many times over,” he said. “Property tax relief started off as something they campaigned on, but then when it came out, they’re making sure that luxury jets get property tax relief.”
The gathering drew former elected officials like Joan Wagnon, who served in the House and as Topeka mayor, along with 13 current representatives and senators, Kansas Board of Education members, Topeka Mayor Michael Padilla and others.
After Kelly spoke, a panel made up of House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, of Lenexa, and Topeka Reps. Alexis Simmons, John Alcala, and Haskins answered questions from the audience.
Those questions focused primarily on what actions people could take to make a difference, as well as concerns about Medicaid cuts and mental health services.
The panel encouraged people to contact their legislators, to go to their offices and be heard. 
“I’m on my soapbox. Settle in,” Simmons said, drawing laughs. “Y’all know how many races in the state of Kansas, in the state Legislature, are won or lost by only double digits? It’s crazy. There are so many. We just lost a state senator in Leavenworth — he lost by 31 votes.”
Simmons encouraged people to talk to everyone and tell them to vote all the way down the ballot.
“Do not vote only for president. Don’t vote only for Congress. Vote all the way down,” she said.
The next fight back tour events will be in Wichita on June 5 and Newton on June 6. Details are on the House Democrats Facebook page.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sarah-ruiz-manley-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the variant in a sample collected May 15 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to the state Department of Health. As of Thursday morning, that’s been the only case confirmed in Washington, and it’s unclear whether the May 15 case was in a state resident or a visitor.
The case was found through the CDC’s Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance that detects COVID through voluntary nasal swabs and wastewater samples at a number of American airports.
Washington is one of a handful of states where a case has been reported.
As its prevalence has grown quickly around the world, the World Health Organization has designated the new variant, NB.1.8.1, as one “under monitoring.” NB.1.8.1 is fueling a spike in infections and hospitalizations in China, for example.
But the organization believes the variant doesn’t lead to more severe illness than current versions of the virus. Local health officials agree.
“In general, I think that there’s low concern,” said Dr. Herbert Duber, regional medical officer with the state Department of Health. “But I think with any new variants, we really do need to monitor them.”
Current vaccines are expected to remain effective against NB.1.8.1.
But the new variant comes as the Trump administration has shifted vaccination guidelines.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced this week that the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID vaccine for healthy children or pregnant women. The Trump administration has also limited eligibility for the vaccine, holding it should only be given to people over 65 or those with risk factors from other medical conditions.
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would require new testing to prove the shots are effective for younger people.
Critics see these moves as unnecessary and dangerous.
Less than one in five Washingtonians received a COVID vaccine booster this season, according to state data.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)When it comes to the Family and Social Services Administration — which oversees Medicaid alongside other state programs like child care subsidies — Gov. Mike Braun “inherited a mess,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob said Friday. 
Roob is taking his second turn leading the agency, which has the single largest budget due to its federal funding. Previously, he led FSSA under former Gov. Mitch Daniels. 
Donning his now-standard “Make Medicaid Boring Again” hat, Roob said the state had “no other choice” than to make the program more sustainable and fiscally sound. He spoke at the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute’s 2025 Policy Summit in Indianapolis. 
“Very few people wear — other than (President) Donald Trump — wear their job description on their hat, but I do,” said Roob. “That is our task for the next four years.”
House GOP overwhelmingly votes to impose Medicaid work requirements

Under Daniels, Roob launched the earliest version of the Healthy Indiana Plan, which covers moderate-to-low-income Hoosiers but has grown since its first iteration. HIP 3.0, on the other hand, would return to its roots and “inject personal responsibility for able-bodied adults again,” Roob said, putting it into alignment with federal discussions on work requirements for the Medicaid program.
Also in his first term, Roob said the agency conducted monthly finance reporting and other fiscal checks to tamp down on spending. He said departing from that norm in subsequent administrations is when the program went awry, pointing specifically to cost growth for applied behavior analysis therapy and attendant care.
The former is a treatment sought by some parents with autistic children while the latter is a program that previously allowed parents to be paid as caregivers for their children with complex medical needs. 
“… that lack of accountability, that lack of paying attention to the dollars is why we had ABA therapy growing at a pace that we did. It’s why we had attendant care growing at the pace that it did,” said Roob. “It’s very difficult to put that genie back in the bottle here because, in both of those cases, we had created, inadvertently, a dependency.” 
He never specifically named former Gov. Eric Holcomb in his criticism.
 Details on health programs

In 2019, Indiana’s Medicaid program spent $120 million on ABA therapy, but the program ballooned to $639 million by 2023. In response, Braun established a panel to consider cost controls earlier this month. 
“If you think this is sustainable, you’re budgeting at the federal level,” quipped Roob. “Because this will bankrupt Indiana.” 
Similarly, attendant care costs for parents of disabled children grew rapidly during that time span. Roob said the agency spent $11 million monthly in July 2020 but the number soared to $84 million each month by May 2024, when the agency diverted parents to a structured family caregiving program that paid at a lower rate. 
Combined, Roob said those numbers contributed to a December 2023 state forecast determining Indiana was $1 billion short in its Medicaid budget. 
Providers, seniors continue to experience challenges under PathWays program

“Many folks look at the Medicaid program and they go, ‘How did you get in debt a billion dollars?’ Well, it’s because you have so many more people receiving care and help. Because we are paying so much more for very discrete parts of the agency,” Roob said. 
Another program that transitioned care for elderly Hoosiers from state oversight to a contract with insurers — known as managed care entities — would “never” be something he would pursue, said Roob. 
“I have been quite clear this program … I never would implement (it),” said Roob. “Because it’s very difficult for managed care companies to manage the care of individuals who are in nursing homes. What is the value?”
Early pitches said the PathWays to Aging program would deliver savings because the state would pay a flat fee for Hoosiers and private companies would manage their care, rather than Indiana paying piecemeal for every cost. However, the transition to get there “is very difficult,” Roob said.
“We have not, today, seen the results that we are hoping for,” said Roob, adding that the state will pay $300 million extra to the companies in cost overruns this year. “… it’s been painful for everybody involved so far and that pain shows signs of easing — but only signs.”
 Other comments

Roob didn’t limit his criticisms of previous administrations solely to health care programs, also saying there was “a lack of planning” when it came to the state’s child care options. Roughly 75,000 children currently receive some form of child care through the agency, an increase initially funded by federal pandemic dollars, Roob said. 
“Their plan was in April of this year simply to take children off of the child care program with no particular warning,” asserted Roob. “Gov. Braun and the legislature felt that was probably not the best answer, so they have allowed us to create a slope to slowly dr0p people from the child care program. 
“That doesn’t minimize the fact that we’re losing over 20,000 daycare slots for the children of men and women who make below 127% of the poverty level,” continued Roob.

Additionally, the “lack of planning and forethought by our predecessors” meant that there would be even fewer options for parents seeking child care for infants or one year olds. 
Part of the problem with Indiana’s Medicaid spending can be attributed to the state’s high health care costs, an explicit priority for Braun. Since his tenure under Daniels, Roob said the disparity between what Hoosiers pay and what they receive has worsened. 
“When Gov. Daniels was in office, I used to tell people that Indiana residents were buying a Cadillac and getting a Chevrolet,” Roob said. “Unfortunately, today, we’re no longer driving Chevrolet. We are driving a used Kia.”

COOK COUNTY — The day before Christmas eve in 2023, Andrew Ciaccio was up all night trying to soothe his stomach pains.

When he woke, he could barely sit up. Something was wrong.

“It was pretty intense,” he recalled. “I was vomiting and really sweating and really feverish and just really in rough shape. [I] couldn’t even put shoes on.”

Panicked, his partner looked up the nearest hospital: Advocate Masonic Hospital.

Once Ciaccio  got to the hospital, a new panic set in. What should he expect to pay for the surgery? Would the medical care be covered by his insurance? He and his partner didn’t get any answers as forms were thrust upon him to sign to get him into an emergency appendectomy, a surgery that removes an inflamed appendix.

He asked multiple people for a good faith estimate but none could provide one.

Months later, he’d become one of hundreds of thousands of Cook County residents buried under medical debt. Ciaccio who earns between 60,000 and 70,000 a year  is slowly paying off the more than $10,000 in medical bills that the hospital has moved to collections. It will take Ciaccio two to three years to pay it off, delaying his goals of saving for retirement and threatening his ability to rent an apartment and buy a car.



[caption id=""attachment_69103"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] After a health care emergency in 2023, Andrew Ciaccio ended up with $10,000 dollars in medical bills. The debt, he says, is impacting his future. (Akilah Townsend for Illinois Answers Project)[/caption]



His debt was not part of Cook County’s medical debt buy program. But with his income level and the amount of his debt, he possibly could have qualified.

Since 2022, Cook County has spent more than $4 million to forgive nearly $500 million worth of medical debt for some 278,000 residents, becoming a pioneer among local governments and garnering waves of positive publicity for their efforts.

But an analysis of Cook County’s debt relief accounts show that many people like Ciaccio saddled with debt should have qualified for free care, a sign that local hospitals are failing to screen for some of the region’s poorest patients even as some use aggressive tactics to collect debt. And commercial insurance companies are shifting more and more costs onto patients, sinking them into debt.

The data from the Cook County Medical Debt Relief Initiative revealed that a significant number of people whose debts were forgiven through the program made less than 200% of the federal poverty level, a threshold that nearly every major hospital system in Cook County accepts for providing free care. Researchers say this indicates a common problem: patients are not getting the charity care they qualify for at hospitals, and health care policy efforts need to shift to make sure financial help is provided much earlier in the billing process.

Undue Medical Debt, the nonprofit contracted with Cook County to negotiate debt buys with health systems and collections agencies, said there are several reasons the majority of accounts forgiven are from people making below 200% of the federal poverty level. Some of it could be inadequate charity care assessment by providers and reluctance by patients to ask for help or fill out paperwork with their financial information, said Eva Stahl, the Vice President of Public Policy and Program Management at Undue Medical Debt.

Patient income data is collected when the debt is bought. That could be years after a health crisis, and the health crisis itself may have sunk some people into a lower income bracket, according to Undue Medical Debt.

Data from three years of the county’s debt relief program also reveals that insurance holders, like Ciaccio, make up the biggest share of debts forgiven, a sign that insurance coverage is often too thin to handle major medical needs.

Daniel Lempert, a spokesperson for Undue, said Medicaid makes up a small portion of the county’s overall debt because the insurance requires little copayment. Medicare requires higher copayment, but not comparable to those required by commercial insurance and plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

One accounting firm analyzed debt from nearly 1,500 hospitals across the country and found that debt from commercial insured accounts increased from 11.1% of total debt in 2018 to 57.6% in 2021.

“Patients are the collateral damage”

Commercial insurance plans have been shifting costs to patients for decades by increasing monthly premiums and making patients pay increasingly bigger shares of hospital bills. That means that more people making middle-class salaries need help paying for medical care.

The hospital and insurance industries have been pointing fingers at each other for years, blaming the other for saddling patients with crippling debt. Hospitals say insurance companies are covering less to pad profit margins and insurance companies say hospitals’ massive bills forced them to shift costs to patients.

“There is this unsustainable lobby in this war back and forth between these two massive entities that make up a double digit chunk of the US economy. These are Goliaths and patients are the collateral damage,” said Eli Rushbank, the director of policy advocacy at Dollar For, a nonprofit helping patients access charity care.

Sarah Panahi, for example, made about $70,000 a year as a grant writer in Chicago when she was hospitalized in 2023, which would disqualify her from almost every financial aid and charity care program.

But she was already under massive debt, from helping her family with rent, groceries and utility bills and after a drunk driver hit her car so badly she needed to buy a new one.

In an unfortunate twist, the stress of her debts triggered a mental health crisis that required a five day stay at the psychiatric wing of a hospital in December of 2023 that she could not afford.

“My insurance, BlueCross BlueShield PPO, I feel like that’s one of the best you can get,” she said. “I just didn’t know the deductible would be so insane,” she said, referring to the nearly $3,000 she owed for the five day stay. Insurance paid about $10,400, but she owed some $2,000 for the deductible, a $200 copay and another $700 in coinsurance, the billing split between patient and insurer.

“I just have anxiety now, like, even more anxiety than before,” she said. “Am I gonna be able to pay this month? Are they gonna come after me?”


EXPLAINER: What is a deductible? Copay? Coinsurance?
▶︎ Deductible is the amount the patient has to pay before insurance pays anything for hospital stays, tests and procedures.

▶︎ Copay is what the patient has to pay each time they go to the doctor and sometimes emergency room.

▶︎ Coinsurance, which is a somewhat more recent development, is the split between what the insurance pays and the patient pays. So if a patient has a 20% coinsurance, they’d have to pay $2,000 of a $10,000 bill in addition to the deductible.

▶︎ Premium is the monthly cost of having insurance.



Panahi recently called the hospital pleading with them, but the most help they could offer was a payment plan, a couple hundred dollars a month for the next few years.

That means she doesn’t go out to eat, can’t go on dates or other social events.

“I can’t remember the last time I bought a latte,” she said.

The whole experience, including a hospital stay that she found unpleasant and traumatic, has made her scared of going back to an emergency room for care.

“I do not want to step foot in the hospital for as long as I can,” she said.

“I’m trying to take as good care of myself as I possibly can. If I have to go to the hospital for any reason, I literally don’t know what I would do.”

The county’s debt relief program, managed by the nonprofit Undue Medical Debt, buys up debt that’s anywhere from 18 months to 7 or more years old. At that point, patients have likely suffered through aggressive collections tactics, experts say.

 “I just have anxiety now, like, even more anxiety than before… Am I gonna be able to pay this month? Are they gonna come after me?” - Sarah Panahi

An Illinois Answers Project analysis of some of Cook County’s largest hospital systems show that many of them use harmful tactics to force payment out of residents, some of whom are among the poorest in the county. Hospitals might deny medically necessary care, put a lien on homes, garnish wages or hire collections agencies that call and text threatening messages regularly.

Since the early 2000s, hospitals, especially nonprofit hospitals that have financial obligations to serve community needs, have come under pressure to reform collections policies as frustrated patients and advocate groups demand change.

Advocate Masonic Hospital where Ciaccio and Panahi were admitted is in the middle of a multi-year effort to scale back harmful collections policy. Last year, Advocate announced it would cancel liens placed on homes and real estate as part of previous efforts to collect on debt. And in 2022, Advocate Health said it would stop reporting debts to credit agencies, make more people eligible for charity care and stop filing lawsuits and seeking liens as part of its collection efforts.

But that’s not what happened for Ciaccio after his health crisis in 2023.

A few months after his procedure, once his bills were overdue, debt collectors threatened to send his bill to the credit agencies, which would have tanked his credit score. He was able to set up a monthly installment plan, but the process took a toll.

“Every time I’d get a letter from them, I’d get this shock or adrenaline or cortisol or just feel fear,” he said. “It’s a scary interaction to have with them because they have all the cards and you’re talking about a lot of money.”

A representative for the hospital did not address the discrepancy but stressed that the hospital is “among the most generous in the country, offering full charity care to patients earning up to 300% of the federal poverty level and significant discounts for many others.”

Relief, but too late

Medical debt relief is still a relatively new concept. Does it work?

That’s what a group of researchers wanted to find out.

Of course, for individuals stressed over debt, the cancellation can be a huge relief.

But one of the first efforts to study the effectiveness of medical debt relief in 2024 revealed that its effectiveness is limited.

Researchers working with Undue Medical Debt found that relief programs are often too late to make a difference.

“We were studying debts forgiven at least a year and a half and sometimes up to seven years after the precipitating event. The debt has already been picked over by debt collectors,” said Neale Mahoney, a Stanford University economics professor and co-author of the study. “People may have already been hardened to the debt collection process. If they get used to ignoring phone calls and letters, they’re outside of the window for follow-up care.”

That’s why charitable organizations and nonprofits can buy older medical debt for a tiny fraction of the original bill: hospitals have largely given up on collecting older debts and efforts to get payments have already done their harm to the patients.

“It’s the result of bad luck, not bad financial behavior, right… You choose to max out your credit card. You choose to buy a car. Most people don’t choose to go to the ER.” - Neale Mahoney, economics professor, Stanford University

“The advice I’ve given to policy makers, local and federal level, is that the research is starting to tell us that we want to pair downstream debt relief with intervention with medical debt closer to the source,” he said.

Undue Medical Debt responded to the study’s conclusions by noting that the organization has made a number of changes since 2018 to 2020, the years researchers examined the group’s impact through buying up debt. Those changes include shifting eligibility to buy debt from higher-income families, erasing debt sooner and supporting financial counseling and insurance coverage navigation to prevent debt.

That could look like improving financial aid provided by hospitals at the front end so that patients won’t have a medical debt burden or other policies aiming to curb harmful collections practices. In the last few years, Undue Medical Debt has been developing a policy advocacy operation to expand its debt relief platform beyond buying up debt.

“They faced some criticism, including from me, saying, focusing entirely on forgiving old medical debt might not really be the solution we think it is,” said Dr. Luke Messac, a doctor and medical debt relief advocate. “It’s really just bailing out debt collectors and hospitals that are particularly unforgiving and doing not as much as we’d hope for the patients.”

One concrete benefit of debt relief, even in the late stages, is that credit scores can go up to allow people to rent better apartments and get better rates for big purchases.

But legislators have also been making changes. In January, an Illinois law went into effect forbidding credit bureaus from factoring in medical debt in credit reports and scores.

That follows a policy shift among three major credit bureaus that erased medical debt under $500 from its reports in 2023.

Medical debt shouldn’t be a measure of a person’s ability to pay back loans because people often don’t choose to need medical care, said Mahoney.

“It’s the result of bad luck, not bad financial behavior, right?” he  said. “You choose to max out your credit card. You choose to buy a car. Most people don’t choose to go to the ER.”

“People are falling through the cracks”

Shepard Searl took a job at Starbucks because they heard the company offered good health insurance.

But as their health deteriorated and monthly health insurance costs went up, it was harder to work the hours needed to cover the cost of managing multiple chronic illnesses.

After a few health emergencies, they went into debt.

“All of these things culminating went from [making debt] something that was manageable to a thing that was suffocating and really dictating every aspect of my life,” they said. “A big chunk of my paycheck was immediately going to paying recurring fees.”

Eventually, Searl had to take a leave of absence from work and their friends set up a GoFundMe to help them pay off medical expenses. Searl now qualifies for Medicaid.

Medicaid is only available to the people making some of the lowest incomes — about $26,650 for a family of three and about $15,650 for an individual. Those who make more, but still qualify for charity care, often slip through the cracks. About 2 in 3 people whose debts were forgiven were making less than 200% of the federal poverty level, or $31,000 a year, the level that would qualify them for these programs and help them avoid medical debt from the outset.

﻿﻿﻿


One study estimates that there’s some $14 billion in undistributed charity care that ends up as debt, according to Dollar For, a nonprofit that helps people claim financial aid and charity care from hospitals.

“One thing to realize is that the system itself is broken,” said Stahl.

“We are going to capture people that have gotten lost and fall through the cracks.”

Dollar For found through a survey that more than half of the people eligible for financial assistance never apply, said Rushbanks. That’s because the majority of those people didn’t know they could get financial help and some were confused by the process.

By 2014, Illinois required every hospital to develop a policy that fast tracks certain groups of vulnerable and low-income patients for charity care without requiring them to apply for aid, including several mandatory categories like homelessness and those eligible for medicaid but uninsured when receiving care.

Hospitals in urban areas are also required to automatically provide aid for people whose incomes are below 200% of the federal poverty level or who are eligible for government assistance.

These policies are meant to prevent people who qualify for charity care from getting saddled with debt because they struggle to navigate the financial help application process. But the policies don’t always work, Rushbanks said.

There’s not always an enforcement mechanism. Sometimes patients are required to provide paperwork and documentation that they don’t end up submitting. Other times hospitals may not have a good system for catching people who fit these categories.

And patients, like Searl and Ciaccio, say hospital staff didn’t talk about financial aid until they explicitly asked them about it.

Prevention, not just relief

Once the debt goes into collections, the repeated texts and calls begin.

For Searl, the debt collector with Evanston Hospital was Harris and Harris.

“They would call multiple times a week, send texts multiple times a week, and email multiple times a week,” Searl recalled. “If I answered, they’d try to get me to pay everything upfront. I would explain that I was on a payment plan but couldn’t keep up with larger bills, and then it would be a back and forth until I got them off the line.”

Endeavor Health, the parent company of Evanston Hospital, said they send statements over the course of 120 days before sending the debt to a collection agency and “ensure interactions are respectful and aligns with our values.”

An Endeavor spokesperson also wrote in an email that the health system “proactively” screens patients for charity care eligibility and provides “free care based on a patient’s income in relation to the federal poverty level.”

Decades ago, hospitals would keep debt records without trying to collect them, said Messac. But several big changes at the federal level, after the creation of Medicaid and Medicare programs in 1965, heavily impacted the industry.

For one, hospitals pulled back on charity care, arguing that the most vulnerable people now have government insurance, he said.

The IRS then changed the standard for nonprofit hospitals – from a model of providing as much charity care as financially possible to a more vague standard of benefiting the community, said Messac.

“But it’s kind of nebulous, and hospitals don’t really lose tax exemption if they don’t do enough,” he said.

And as hospitals grow into billion-dollar regional health systems that compete for market dominance, many turned to aggressively pursuing debt to make up for Medicaid and Medicare, which typically reimburses less than private insurers.

Despite its limitations, Cook County’s debt relief program has multiplied in other parts of the country: more than 20 government medical debt relief programs to be exact, according to Rachel Ruttenberg, deputy chief of staff for the Office of the Cook County Council President.

“We started a bit of a movement,” said Ruttenberg.

But the program alone won’t solve medical debt, she said. The ultimate goal is to have accessible and affordable health care for everyone.

“And it honestly allows us to continue talking about medical debt. We understand that this is not a strategy for solving medical debt, but instead, we want to eliminate as much medical debt as possible while continuing to bring attention to the serious issue of medical debt and just showcase how much of a financial burden it is on people,” said Ruttenberg. “The real fix is to have universal health care coverage in this country.”

There have been pockets of success throughout the country when it comes to debt collection reform.

Los Angeles County followed suit with its own medical debt relief program a few years after Cook County. But they don’t just buy up debt.

The county also requires hospitals to disclose key data regarding financial assistance provided and debt collections efforts, including placing a lien on patient’s property, seizing bank accounts, suing patients, garnishing wages or denying care due to debt.

Messac, a longtime advocate for regulating medical debt, also points to North Carolina as an example of successful government intervention.

There, Gov. Roy Cooper leveraged federal funding in exchange for nearly 100 hospitals wiping out billions of dollars of debt and adopting standards that allow more patients to get financial aid. 

For Cook County, the lesson is likely the need for medical debt prevention in addition to debt relief, which she said is also critical, said Mara Heneghan, the former director of policy at the office of the Cook County president. She was part of the team that worked on the launch of the medical debt relief program.

“Ultimately, it’s unsurprising that it’s more helpful to cancel debt earlier on,” she said.

“We need to think about prevention of medical debt, so we’re not putting people in that position.”

You would immediately pull your children out of daycare and report the whole business to the state. 
Why then, are we allowing firearms to be stored in family childcare homes, which are very similar to in-home daycares, without notice to the caregivers so they can make an informed decision on whether to place their child in this home? This is why I am writing in support of Committee Bill 6180.  

Cassidy Irwin
Firearms in the home are a documented danger to children. Children younger than 5 years old are the second most likely age group to accidentally shoot themselves. Children are naturally curious and do not understand the gravity of playing with firearms. This risk is compounded when children are grouped together in an informal setting like a family childcare home. 
Around half of all accidental firearm deaths of children between 2001 and 2021 occurred in their home, whether by playing with the gun or showing it off to other children. Guns can also accidentally fire when stored improperly, potentially injuring those in the area. Research shows that, while children may be safer when unloaded guns are securely stored with ammunition sheltered separately, children are safest when all firearms are stored outside of the home.  
Dissenters may argue that these regulations encroach upon the homeowner’s privacy and their Second Amendment rights. These concerns have merit but, in policy, a balance must be negotiated between the homeowner’s individual rights and the children’s rights to a safe and secure place of education. I support this law because it ensures that caregivers are not unknowingly placing their children into a dangerous situation that could end their life. Caregivers have a right to know that the safety of their child is prioritized. I also support the subsection that allows the Office of Early Childhood to revoke the license of any business found in violation of this requirement. 
However, my only recommendation would be that firearms should not be stored in a residence that is licensed by the state as a family child care home. I think that the license revocation should also apply if the homeowners do not remove the firearms from the residence. If this cannot be achieved, the caregivers should be given more information as to the state of the firearm storage in the home, rather than simply whether or not firearms are present. Parents would not tolerate the presence of guns in a school or a commercial daycare. The same protections should be extended to licensed family child care homes so that parents can send their children to daycare knowing their safety is ensured.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Roughly 150 nurses and their allies gathered at dusk Thursday for a vigil to show support for the strike underway at Meriter hospital in Madison.
The crowd was smaller than the throngs that have gathered outside the hospital during daily picketing and rallies, but the feelings they conveyed were no less intense.
“We’re holding this vigil because beneath the charts, beneath the chants, beneath the signs and beneath the daily strength that it takes to strike is something deeply serious,” said emergency room nurse Shelby Davis. “We’re not just here for better contracts. We’re here for safety, for dignity, for the basic right to care for our patients without risking their lives or our own.”
With the vigil, organized with the involvement of two church pastors, the nurses and their union sought to cast the issues that led to the five-day walkout as a matter of moral principle.
“You are doing holy work,” said Pastor Justin Dittrich of Lake Edge Lutheran Church, opening the vigil at Brittingham Park on Madison’s near South Side, a block from the hospital grounds.
“The strike is not the end, but the beginning of a more just health care system for all people, workers and participants,”  Dittrich added. “We stand with the nurses of Meriter because they are healers, truth tellers, and agents of faith and justice.”
UnityPoint Health-Meriter and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Wisconsin are in the midst of negotiations for a new labor agreement for about 1,000 nurses who work at the hospital. The nurses union began a five-day strike Tuesday after a bargaining session May 19 ended without a new agreement, and after the union’s bargaining team said management negotiators were not responding adequately to their concerns about staffing levels, hospital security and compensation.
Negotiations resumed Thursday, during which union bargaining team members reported some progress, and continued on Friday.
Among the union’s primary issues in negotiations has been a demand for specific ratios of nurses to patients.
“Even though I work in the ER and not on the floor, I see how staffing levels affect every part of the hospital,” said Davis. “I’ll never forget the one moment during my nurse residency, a new grad was recognized for taking care of seven patients on their own. Seven. That wasn’t a badge of honor, that was a red flag.”
The hospital management has said dictating ratios would interfere with its need for flexibility to respond to changing conditions.
Speakers said the demand is not just in the interest of nurses, but a matter of concern for patients as well.
“Ratios are for us — yeah, absolutely,” said nurse Dara Pierce. “But they’re also for everybody else and I think sometimes that goes unnoticed.”
The fear of violence in the workplace has driven nurses to demand a stronger role in formulating security policy, speakers said, along with measures such as metal detectors.
“We’ve had violent or unpredictable situations come through our doors with just one security guard assigned to ER and no metal detectors,” said Davis. “No one should have to feel unsafe when they’re coming to a hospital and no nurse should be expected to risk their life just to do their job.”
The lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began five years ago, continues to weigh on health care workers, nurse Annette Bernas told vigil participants.
“We were considered essential, but let’s be honest, we were expendable,” she said. “We didn’t complain. We showed up. We held hands when family members couldn’t.”
As the pandemic laid bare the importance of health care and health care workers, “we were hopeful that everything we gave would open the eyes of the world to the importance of nurses and support staff,” Bernas said. “But here we find ourselves in a deeper crisis. The burnout is real. Nurses are leaving in waves. PTSD from those years is something we still carry, and yet we’re being asked to do more with less.”
After the speeches the crowd walked behind a large yellow banner, carrying flickering candles from the park to the hospital entrance on Brooks Street.
There Pastor Raymond Monk of Milwaukee offered a benediction. 
“This new course has caused many of you all to make a decision to make sure that your voices are heard and the voices of those who are hurting, their voices are heard also,” said Monk. “I want to encourage you at this pivotal moment in history to continue to defy the norms and to make known to the world that things must change and that things must change right now.”
Faith upholds their cause, he suggested, adding that God “is always on the side of the oppressed.”

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.A bill that would overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness is headed to Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s desk, after a largely party-line vote in the House on Thursday evening. Scott and members of his administration have remained mum about whether they support its final iteration. If Scott vetoes the bill, he could effectively kill it. Without a Democratic supermajority, lawmakers are unlikely to have the votes to override.Asked at his weekly press conference whether he would greenlight the legislation, Scott said that he had not yet read the final version of the bill, but indicated that lawmakers “would have had to move a long ways” before gaining his signature. In a separate interview, Department for Children and Families Commissioner Chris Winters said administration officials were still combing through the details.“We’ve started our deep dive to make sure that we understand the full impacts of this bill, and whether it’s possible to make transformational change this year,” Winters said on Thursday afternoon.The bill, H.91, would shift Vermont’s homelessness response system from one centered on state government to one administered by private nonprofit organizations. The change would mark a fundamental pivot in how the state approaches homelessness, which has skyrocketed in Vermont in recent years amid a crushing housing shortage and rising housing costs. The bill dissolves the statewide motel voucher system next July, and hands over funding and decision-making power for emergency shelter to five regional anti-poverty nonprofits and the statewide domestic violence organization. It also gives those groups authority over funds the state currently doles out to build and operate local shelters and run homelessness prevention programs. The state would retain an oversight role.The new regionalized system would be dubbed the Vermont Homeless Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program, or VHEARTH. Its supporters argue that it would create a more efficient and integrated support system for Vermont’s growing homeless population — and allow the state to stop relying on motel and hotel rooms to shelter the bulk of unhoused Vermonters, an issue that has become a perennial political football at the Statehouse.“I think that this puts Vermont on a path forward that is going to be more focused on prevention, [and] reducing and hopefully eventually eliminating the use of the hotels in favor of shelter and more supportive services,” said Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, the bill’s chief architect.Angling for Phil Scott’s signatureScott has long called for the motel voucher program’s pandemic-era expansion to end, and administration officials this year have expressed general support for restructuring the state’s homelessness response system. But they have sparred with lawmakers over key details of the proposed transition. Officials have raised concerns around the ongoing costs of the new initiative, and expressed a desire to speed up the shift of the motel voucher program to the new, localized system.As House and Senate members hashed out their differences over the bill this week, gaining approval from Scott arose as a key concern around the negotiating table. In a bid for his support, lawmakers cut down on a $10 million allocation meant to aid the transition to the regional system by axing $3 million earmarked for shelter development. They also struck provisions that expressed an intent to tie future emergency housing spending to recent years’ budgets, and included language requiring the use of motel rooms to decrease as shelter capacity increases and homelessness numbers drop.Lawmakers also added a provision that “specific elements” of VHEARTH can take effect sooner than planned if state officials and community action agency directors come to an agreement before July of 2026. Some of those directors have balked at the prospect of a faster transition.Winters pointed to some of these changes as positive steps, but did not indicate whether they would be enough to earn Scott’s signature. The administration had wanted lawmakers to add more vetting criteria for people entering the motel program in the coming fiscal year, including verifying their residency in Vermont, their income, and their lack of alternate housing options. Officials also hoped lawmakers would add language allowing them to prioritize the “most vulnerable” clients, rather than relying on a first-come, first-served system.The purpose of those provisions would be to allow the state “to wrangle the [motel voucher program] down to a more manageable size,” Winters said. How quick of a change?The administration had also favored a phased transition to the new regional system, where the motel voucher system would get shifted first, and the funding for local shelter operations would transition in fiscal year 2028. But in a committee of conference, lawmakers aligned the timelines for both transitions to fiscal year 2027, which begins next July.Some directors of local shelters have vehemently opposed transitioning the funding for their work in H.91 at all, arguing that the change could create conflicts of interest in spending decisions, and would destabilize the state’s shelter system at the exact moment federal funding for housing and homelessness programs could disappear.Other critics of the regionalization effort have argued it amounts to an abdication of responsibility by state leaders for Vermont’s worsening homelessness problem.When the Legislature and the administration have placed restrictions on the motel voucher program in recent years — resulting in wave after wave of evictions — “all of our emails light up,” Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, told her colleagues on the floor last week. Her concern, Cummings said, was that by shifting responsibility for emergency housing over to the regional nonprofits, pressure on state officials would wane – and people experiencing homelessness would disappear from public view.“We won’t be the bad guys anymore. The administration won’t be the bad guys,” she said. “It will be very easy for these people to slip under the radar.” (Cummings ultimately voted in favor of the bill).Read the story on VTDigger here:  Phil Scott remains silent on session’s biggest homelessness bill as it heads to his desk.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/housing-conference-1-20250528-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

John Sauer argued that the Immigration Nationality Act bars judicial review of discretionary decisions, such as what is called humanitarian parole, for the CHNV program.He added that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem terminated the program because it does not align with the interests of the Trump administration.Liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.“The Court has plainly botched this assessment today,” Jackson wrote in her dissent. “It undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending.”She argued that the Trump administration did not prove it would be harmed by the preliminary injunction. An appeals court previously rejected the government’s request to put the lower court’s order on hold.“While it is apparent that the Government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum predecision damage, court-ordered stays exist to minimize—not maximize—harm to litigating parties,” Jackson wrote.President Joe Biden created the CHNV program in 2023. It temporarily granted work permits and allowed thousands of nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to remain in the country if they were sponsored by someone in the United States and passed a background check.",,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

AG Tong is pushing back,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/30/ct-sanctuary-jurisdiction-william-tong/,The Trump administration put more than 500 'sanctuary jurisdictions' on notice that it views them as obstructing immigration enforcement.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Homeland Security is putting more than 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions” across the country on notice that the Trump administration views them as obstructing immigration enforcement as it attempts to increase pressure on communities it believes are standing in the way of the president’s mass deportations agenda.
The department on Thursday published a list of the jurisdictions and said each one will receive formal notification that the government has deemed them noncompliant and if they’re believed to be in violation of any federal criminal statutes. The list was published on the department’s website.
“These sanctuary city politicians are endangering Americans and our law enforcement in order to protect violent criminal illegal aliens,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press release.
The Trump administration has repeatedly targeted communities, states and jurisdictions that it says aren’t doing enough to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement as it seeks to make good on President Donald Trump’s campaign promises to remove millions of people in the country illegally.
The list was compiled using a number of factors, including whether the cities or localities identified themselves as sanctuary jurisdictions, how much they complied already with federal officials enforcing immigration laws, if they had restrictions on sharing information with immigration enforcement or had any legal protections for people in the country illegally, according to the department.
Trump signed an executive order on April 28 requiring the secretary of Homeland Security and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions that they considered to be obstructing federal immigration laws. The list is to be regularly updated.
Federal departments and agencies, working with the Office of Management and Budget, would then be tasked with identifying federal grants or contracts with those states or local jurisdictions that the federal government identified as “sanctuary jurisdictions” and suspending or terminating the money, according to the executive order.
If “sanctuary jurisdictions” are notified and the Trump administration determines that they “remain in defiance,” the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security are then empowered to pursue whatever “legal remedies and enforcement measures” they consider necessary to make them comply.
There’s no specific or legal definition of what constitutes a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” The term is often used to refer to law enforcement agencies, states or communities that don’t cooperate with immigration enforcement.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong pushed back after the state was included on the list. He said the label was inaccurate.
“There is nothing in our laws or statutes that says Connecticut is a ‘sanctuary’ state. We are not. That is a meaningless term,” Tong said in a statement Friday. 
“It is the policy of the State of Connecticut to respect, honor and protect immigrants and immigrant families in compliance with the law. Trump’s own administration certified Connecticut’s compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 in 2017. Nothing has changed to alter that certification, other than Trump’s unhinged fixation on defunding and commandeering our police,” Tong said.
ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide, but often seeks state and local help in alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding that person until federal officers take custody.
One way that the administration seeks to enlist state and local support is through 287(g) agreements with local law enforcement agencies. Those agreements allow local law enforcement agencies to assume some immigration enforcement duties and greatly expand ICE’s capabilities. The number of those agreements has skyrocketed in just a matter of months under the Trump administration.
ICE has about 6,000 law enforcement officers — a number that has remained largely static for years — who are able to find, arrest and remove immigrants it is targeting. By relying on local law enforcement, it can quickly scale up the number of staff available to help carry out Trump’s mass deportations agenda.
Communities that don’t cooperate with ICE often say they do so because immigrants then feel safer coming forward if they’re a witness to or victim of a crime. And they argue that immigration enforcement is a federal task, and they need to focus their limited dollars on fighting crime.
“Sanctuary policies are legal and make us all safer,” said a coalition of local officials from across the country and a nonprofit called Public Rights Project in a statement Thursday. They said the list was a fear tactic designed to bully local governments into cooperating with ICE.
The Trump administration has already taken a number of steps targeting states and communities that don’t cooperate with ICE — and has met with pushback in the courts. One executive order issued by Trump directs the Attorney General and Homeland Security Secretary to withhold federal money from sanctuary jurisdictions. Another directs federal agencies to ensure that payments to state and local governments do not “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

Building trades push for data center tax incentives
With Democrats and Republicans at an impasse over an infrastructure spending package, building trade unions are banking on lawmakers extending tax breaks for data centers to spur investment in high-paying construction jobs.
The push comes as President Trump’s federal funding cuts and ongoing trade war, compounded by high interest rates, have soured the economic outlook for construction jobs.
“There’s not a surplus of work right now,” said Richard Kolodziejski, government affairs director for the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters.
Building one large data center can cost upwards of $1 billion, dwarfing the roughly $700 million bonding bill Minnesota lawmakers could authorize this year to pay for water treatment plants, roads and other infrastructure.
The building trades unions warn that Minnesota will lose jobs to neighboring states if it doesn’t compete on tax breaks to entice tech giants like Amazon and Meta to build data centers. The tax incentives also help justify prevailing wage requirements, which ensures much of the construction will be done by union workers.
But some progressive lawmakers chafe at the idea of giving tax breaks to some of the richest companies in the world while the state stares down a looming budget deficit. They aren’t convinced these projects wouldn’t be built anyways given the state’s cold climate and strong economy.
“I understand not wanting to give tax breaks to the wealthy, but those are the folks creating the jobs,” said Tom Dicklich, executive director of the Minnesota State Building & Construction Trades Council.
One hyperscale data center costing $750 million creates upwards of 1,800 construction jobs and 300 ongoing operational jobs, according to a 2022 report on Wisconsin by Mangum Economics, which has produced similar reports sponsored by tech and energy companies for Virginia and Illinois.
A coalition of building trades unions, energy companies and other businesses cited that report in a letter to lawmakers urging them to extend the sales tax exemption on software, servers and other equipment used to power the data centers.

The growing cost of tax breaks for data centers has vexed public sector unions, who see the lost revenue cutting into funding for the schools, nursing homes and state agencies where their members work.
The public sector unions — SEIU, Education Minnesota, AFSCME, MAPE and Inter Faculty Organization — signed onto a letter opposing an early version of the bill (HF1277) backed by the building trade unions, pointing out that the cost of the sales tax exemption has increased by more than 20-fold since 2018. That cost is expected to continue to rise, reaching $219 million in forgone sales tax revenue on servers, software and other equipment in fiscal year 2029.
It was a rare instance of discord among unions who are typically disciplined about being unified in public, despite their many differences across industries. Member unions of the Minnesota AFL-CIO had signed onto a resolution in support of sales tax exemptions for constructing data centers, but the bill that was introduced in February went further. It extended sales tax exemptions on electricity and allowed data centers to claim the sales tax exemption up front rather than through a rebate, which creates a public record of how much sales tax was lost.
“It would be one thing, if the unions were upfront, that this bill is good for their members … Unfortunately, they want the rest of the Labor Movement to support their lobbying efforts and to call tax cuts for billionaires a ‘pro-labor’ bill. This we cannot do,” SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa President Jamie Gulley wrote in a post to his members in April, explaining his opposition.
The debate was so contentious, Gulley wrote, that one unnamed trade union to threaten to leave the AFL-CIO.
The building trades counter that data centers add to state coffers through other taxes, including income taxes paid by their members.
“We don’t have line items in the state budget that goes directly to the building trades,” Dicklich said. “Where we can get work, we have to go after that.”
Amazon announced amid the ongoing negotiations at the Legislature that the company is suspending plans for a big data center in Becker, the Star Tribune reported.
Head of violence intervention non-profit charged with wage theft
Bishop Harding Smith, the head of the violence intervention nonprofit Minnesota Acts Now, was charged with felony wage theft and theft by swindle in Hennepin County on Thursday for allegedly shorting workers $150,000 from a county contract.
While wage theft is common, charges are still relatively rare even since Minnesota made it a felony in 2019. The first felony wage theft conviction was handed down just last month to a painting contractor for stealing more than $35,000 in wages from workers on an affordable housing project in Minneapolis.
“Bishop Harding Smith failed to pay his employees what he agreed to as part of the contract with Hennepin County and then lied about it when seeking payroll expense reimbursements,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement announcing the charges. “As I said when our office secured the state’s first wage theft conviction, this behavior will not be tolerated.”
According to the charging document, Harding signed a contract with Hennepin County in 2021 in which he would be an unpaid volunteer and would pay all other workers $35 an hour. The contract was later updated to increase the contract amount to more than $550,000 and provide Harding with a $35 an hour wage. Investigators found most employees were paid $20 an hour even though he billed the county as if they were paid $35 an hour.
Harding admitted to investigators that he did not pay workers what they were entitled to but denied fraudulent intent, according to the complaint.
Trump flips on Nippon deal with U.S. Steel
In a rare instance of unanimity on the campaign trail last year, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump opposed Japanese-owned Nippon’s $14.1 billion bid to purchase U.S. Steel.
The politics were simple: The United Steelworkers, representing tens of thousands of workers in purple states like Pennsylvania, fiercely opposed the deal. And in a campaign fought over blue collar workers, supporting a foreign company taking over an icon of American industry would have been unthinkable.
Now back in the Oval Office, President Trump has seemingly flipped on his opposition to the deal, writing on his social media platform last Friday that there will be a “planned partnership” between the two steel giants
Trump said U.S. Steel would remain in America with its headquarters in Pittsburgh, and the deal would create 70,000 jobs. It’s unclear how a “planned partnership” would be different than a buyout, and as The American Prospect noted, the U.S. Steel website describes the deal as a merger.
United Steelworkers President Dave McCall sent a letter to members, which include 3,500 workers in Minnesota, reiterating his concerns.
“Throughout recent months, as the public conversation has turned to Nippon ‘investing’ in U.S. Steel or ‘partnering with’ U.S. Steel, Nippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in U.S. Steel’s facilities if it owned the company outright. We’ve seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position,” he wrote.
Planned Parenthood lays off 66 across Minnesota and Iowa

Federal funding cuts are forcing Planned Parenthood North Central States to close eight clinics across Minnesota and Iowa this summer, laying off 66 workers and reassigning three dozen more.
The health system, which is the main abortion provider in Minnesota, announced the closures last week, blaming a $2.8 million freeze in Title X funding in Minnesota that supports sexual and reproductive health. The organization also cited the near total abortion ban in Iowa following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade and House Republicans’ “big beautiful bill,” which defunds Planned Parenthood and makes cuts to Medicaid, which subsidizes care for more than 30% of its patients.
More than 400 workers at the Planned Parenthood affiliate, which covers Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and the Dakotas, unionized with SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa in 2022 and ratified their first labor contract last year.
Megan Amato, a longtime licensed practical nurse in Iowa and Nebraska, said she was devastated by the news in a statement shared by the union.
“When I started 18 years ago, we had 17 clinics in Iowa. After these closures we will be down to two,” Amato said. “I am the only person who does my job in the whole state and I worry about what that means for the future of abortion care in Iowa.”
None of the clinics slated to close in Minnesota provide abortion care, but do provide birth control, education and other health care services. PPNCS said it will continue investing in telemedicine to serve patients, which includes medication abortion for patients with a Minnesota address.
Lawsuit challenging nursing home holiday pay dismissed
In a victory for Minnesota’s new Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by two industry groups challenging the board’s authority to mandate that nursing homes pay workers time-and-a-half on 11 holidays.
The lawsuit was the first legal challenge to the board since the Legislature created it in 2023 to set minimum pay and working standards for nursing home workers across the state.
Trade war shakes global jobs outlook
The International Labour Organization cut its global employment forecast by 7 million jobs as President Trump’s trade war roils the world economy. The United Nations agency previously projected the world would add 60 million jobs in 2025, revising it down to 53 million jobs this week.
According to the report, nearly 84 million jobs across 71 countries are directly or indirectly tied to consumer demand in the United States, which is being throttled by uncertainty and higher prices from Trump’s tariffs. A federal appeals court on Thursday reinstated Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs after the U.S. Court of International Trade paused them on Wednesday.
The International Labour Organization also reported that the share of the world’s gross domestic product going to workers globally ticked down over the past decade from 53% to 52.4%. In other words, less of the world’s income is going to the workers generating that income by creating goods and providing services. While the decline is slight, the International Labour Organization estimates it works out to about $290 less per worker in 2024 purchasing power.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_1065-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

But that punishment doesn’t mean those involved with Robertsville-manufacturer Delta Extraction are out of the Missouri marijuana industry. 
In fact, long after the state initially stripped Delta Extraction of its license in November 2023, regulators approved one of the company’s co-owners — AJO LLC — to take over a cultivation and manufacturing facility in Waynesville in May 2024. It’s a far bigger operation than Delta Extraction, and it also involves several dispensaries as well.
AJO LLC says it was only a passive investor in Delta Extraction, where it owns 50%. The company claims it bought 50% of the Waynesville facility in 2022 and has been running it while awaiting approval of the license transfer last year.
But now Delta’s license revocation is the center of a lawsuit playing out in St. Louis courts between a complex web of shareholders seeking to snatch back ownership of the Waynesville facility from AJO.
They argue the state shouldn’t have given its final approval for the ownership change because of AJO’s involvement in a company that had a marijuana license revoked. 
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the department that oversees the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation, said the constitution does allow regulators “to deny approval for ownership changes if approval is not ‘unreasonably withheld.’” 
However, in May 2024, Cox said Delta’s appeal of its license revocation was still pending. The final verdict didn’t come down until nine months later. 
“The totality of the circumstances at the time, including the nature of the ownership change, was not sufficient cause to deny the change,” Cox said.
Cox also said the state’s administrative rules – which the division drafts to interpret the constitution’s intent and that take months to pass – currently do not prohibit individuals who have had a license revoked from acquiring another license. 
The division, Cox said, is “reviewing its rules to add further detail to this authority.” 
 Agent ID revocations

 (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).
A scathing 137-page decision issued in February by the Administrative Hearing Commission denying Delta’s appeal of its revoked license concluded the company had a “corporate culture of lax compliance with regulatory requirements.”
Regulators are permitted to revoke agent ID cards for individuals who violate the rules. No one without an agent ID can access a marijuana facility without supervision of someone with a card, though you don’t need one to own or run facilities. 
Within weeks of the Administrative Hearing Commission’s February decision, Cox said the state “revoked several agent IDs for involvement in rule violations associated with Delta Extraction.” 
In March, cannabis regulators issued AJO principal Josh Corson a notice of pending revocation of his agent ID card, according to documents The Independent obtained through Missouri’s Sunshine Law. 
The notice stated that as an owner and manager of Delta Extraction, he was responsible for 17 cited rule violations, including “manufacturing and selling bulk distillate in a false or misleading manner due to the failure to disclose that the distillate contained large quantities of unregulated cannabis.” 
Corson surrendered his agent ID license shortly after receiving the notice, and the other two AJO owners — Ryan Rich and Josh Ferguson — have let their agent IDs expire, Cox said. 
Cannabis regulators revoked the agent ID cards of four of Delta’s contractors as well. 
AJO has been helping run the Waynesville operation since 2022 with Hi-Rise LLC, which is the other 50% owner. Hi-Rise has no ownership interest in Delta Extraction. 
Peter Barden, a spokesman for AJO and Hi-Rise, said the companies “provided complete information” about the owners to the state for the license transfer.
In response to Corson’s agent ID revocation, Barden said AJO “was not managing the Delta Extraction facility. It was a passive investor, and no action of AJO has ever been the basis of any revocation.”
Yet pages of evidence in the Delta Extraction case – including emails, depositions and testimonies from high-level employees – appear to demonstrate AJO was fully involved in Delta’s operations and even initiated the arrangement that led to their revocation.
Barden said AJO “certainly monitors its investments but has not actively managed any manufacturing or cultivation license.” 
 AJO’s lawsuit

 Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).
Charles Pullium stood before a St. Louis judge in February in an emergency hearing, anxious to share what he believed would be a smoking-gun update in his lawsuit.
It was just days after Delta Extraction had lost its appeal seeking to get its license to manufacture marijuana products reinstated. 
Pullium is an attorney representing a group hoping to wrestle the Waynesville manufacturing and cultivation license away from AJO and Hi-Rise. 
If Delta Extraction violated state law to the point where its license was revoked, Pullium argued, its leadership shouldn’t have won state approval to operate a different cannabis facility.
“It’s a huge case because it involves the revocation of a license,” Pullium told St. Louis Judge Joan Moriarty at the February hearing. “And why it’s important in this case is because when people apply for a new change of ownership… they have to answer, ‘Have any of you or your owners or anyone had a license revoked or suspended?’”
Pullium argued the Delta revocation was key to settling a three-year legal ownership battle, which ended up in St. Louis court in 2023 when AJO and Hi-Rise filed a lawsuit. 
On one side of the legal battle are AJO and Hi-Rise.
On the other side are 19 named individuals and marijuana companies connected to the deal, including St. Louis-based marijuana company Heya, former Missouri House Speaker Carl Bearden and Delphi Management LLC. They argue the 2022 sale to AJO and Hi-Rise was invalid.
Moriarty disagreed the new information was worth holding an emergency hearing for and made Pullium’s client pay $3,037.50 in attorney fees for AJO and Hi-Rise, which are represented by Dowd Bennett law firm. 
The lawsuit is ongoing.
In January, Scott Sterling, who is involved in the tangled ownership web, filed two complaints with the Division of Cannabis Regulation, alleging that AJO did not provide all the information necessary for the transfer. 
One crucial detail left out, Sterling contends, is that he never signed off on any sale as a 40% owner.
The division has opened an investigation into Sterling’s complaint, Cox said, and it is ongoing. 
Barden said the Waynesville location is legally owned by AJO and Hi-Rise and “current ownership has never had a license revoked.” 
 ‘…a made for T.V. drama’

One of Pullium’s motions in January returned the spotlight to Jason Sparks, one of Delta Extraction’s contractors.
“The facts underlying the Delta scandal read like a made for T.V. drama,” the motion states, “a prior felon… buys out-of-state products from a nameless and unknown ‘network’… which he then illegally turns into uncertified product which he then sells to a complicit Delta, who then illegally sells to unsuspecting dispensaries…”
Sparks was among the four contractors that had their agent IDs revoked in March, and he has a disqualifying felony on his record that was overlooked by the state when he obtained that ID. However, Sparks directs the blame largely at Corson in legal filings in his company SND Leasing’s lawsuit against Delta Extraction. 
In the spring of 2023, the supply for marijuana distillate was low across the state and Delta hired Sparks to make large amounts of distillate that Delta sold to about 100 other Missouri manufacturers. Those manufacturers went on to produce gummies and vapes for their brands, which is why the product recall was so widespread.
At issue was what’s in the distillate. 
Sparks extracted a small amount of THC from Missouri-grown marijuana, which the state heavily regulates. Then he added a large amount of THC oil that was extracted from hemp, a product that is completely unregulated.
Regulators pulled 60,000 products off the shelves in August 2023, arguing the use of out-of-state, unregulated THC oil violated state law and posed a public health risk. 
Corson was “the person who found the supply for the distillate,” a January motion in Sparks’ lawsuit states, and he was the one who signed the contracts. 
In his lawsuit, Sparks points to the testimony from Delta’s COO Rachel Herndon Dunn during an Administrative Hearing Commission hearing in March 2024. Dunn testified that Corson reached out to a large cannabinoid-producing facility in Florida to obtain the hemp-derived THC oil needed to make their recalled distillate.
“Corson went down to tour their labs in Ft. Lauderdale…” Dunn said during the hearing. 
Sparks claims Delta leadership reassured him that cannabis regulators signed off on the extraction process. 
“The reality is that (the state) never gave assurances of regulatory compliance,” the suit states. 
Delta argued hemp is not a federally controlled substance and the state has no authority to regulate hemp-derived THC products — an argument they lost in their appeal. Also, the products went through a final round of testing before they hit the shelves, Delta noted, so they didn’t pose a health risk.
Despite the ownership connection to Delta, state regulators told The Independent they’ve found no evidence of similar practices taking place at the Waynesville facility.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5927-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 11:09:26.607447

Lundegan, who will formally unveil the plans June 3, wants to replicate the Garden of Gethsemane near Jerusalem where the New Testament says Jesus prayed the night before his crucifixion.
Lundergan has commissioned a sculptor in Italy to create life-size bronze statues of Christ and the main characters in the 14 Stations of the Cross, representations of events in the Passion of Jesus Christ, from his condemnation to burial.
A 70-foot cross, equivalent to a seven-story building, will tower nearby. It will be positioned to reflect sun rays during the Easter season onto Station 12, depicting Jesus dying on the cross.
Excavations are underway for the spectacular religious display in front of the Saint Patrick Cemetery in Washington on U.S. 68 about five miles south of the Ohio River. It will include a visitor’s center.

Asked how much the project will cost, Lundergan said it is privately funded by the Lundergan family and receives no tax dollars. “This is a way for my family to do something to show our love for the church and community that mean so much to us.”
Lundergan said that the price of admission will be minimal if any —  in contrast to other religious attractions —  the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter — in Northern Kentucky. Visitors may leave donations, which will be used to maintain the garden and support St. Patrick Church and school in Maysville, Lundergan said.
Family venture
Lundergan grew up, was baptized and married in St. Patrick Church. He attended St. Patrick School. He will be buried someday at St. Patrick Cemetery along with his wife, Charlotte Lundergan. 
Actress and singer Rosemary Clooney, who was born on Front Street in Maysville in 1928 and died in 2002, is buried there. She was the aunt of international movie star George Clooney.

The historic cemetery includes the tombstones of early immigrants from Ireland. 
The bishop of Covington, the Rev. John Curtis Iffert, has leased land to Lundergan, who will give the entire garden to St. Patrick Church once it is completed.
Lundergan, 78, owns several companies in Lexington in the food services and  hospitality industry and emergency disaster services. 
Lundy’s Catering provided food services at the Woodstock revival, the Kentucky Derby, Indianapolis 500, Pope John Paul II’s celebration of mass with 350,000 in San Antonio in 1987, and presidential inaugurations for Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The Lundergans are close friends to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
President Joe Biden pardoned Lundergan earlier this year for his conviction on federal campaign finance charges involving unreported donations to the 2014 U.S. Senate campaign of his daughter, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Lundergan served time in prison and a halfway house.
Lundergan emphasizes that the garden project is a family venture. Charlotte and he have five daughters and 10 grandchildren.  
To launch planning for the garden project, Lundergan contacted Betty Vento of Mentor, Ohio, an expert on religious statues. She and her husband run Mosack’s, a Christian gifts and book store.
Capturing the ‘spirit of Gethsemane’
“I think this is a fabulous project, nothing like it, I believe, in the United States with bronze statues,” said Vento.  “I understand there is a Stations of the Cross garden in Puerto Rico but it is circular. This one will be on a pathway.”
She said Lundergan called her almost five years ago to pursue the project. “We have moved forward with it and are very excited about it.”

Lundergan commissioned bronze statues by sculptor Reto Demetz. His family business, the Demetz Art Studio, is one of the world’s leaders in producing ecclesiastical art. The studio is located in Ortisei, a small village in Val Gardena, nestled in the Dolomites, the famous mountain range in the heart of the Italian Alps. The studio was founded in 1872.
During the last decades, it has reached worldwide fame for its modern religious sculptures as well as its traditional artworks.
Lexington landscape architect John Carman, of the firm CARMAN, said that when Lundergan first called he was not sure he would have the time to devote to designing the garden. “But it is such a wonderful project, quite unique, I am Catholic, so I was all in,” he said. He worked a year on the design.
Carman said the garden will be a replica of Gethsemane. “The real garden is in a different part of the world, with olive trees. Olive trees do not grow well here.” But visitors “will see a beautiful garden with a lot of flowers and shrubs, some trees, that will capture the spirit of Gethsemane.”
A public groundbreaking ceremony for the project is scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday, June 3, at the site. Christian ministers in Mason County have been invited to attend.
The target date for completion of the project is Easter Sunday, April 5, 2026.
A celebration Mass will be held at the church the Thursday before Easter. A Good Friday program will be held at the stations and an Easter sunrise service will offer praise at the garden.

The special screening of the blockbuster horror film included an appearance by Director Ryan Coogler and was made possible by a community petition.
“I have family from Mississippi — my uncle, my grandfather — and I had never been until working on this script,” Coogler said, addressing the crowd. “It really changed me, just to come here.”
The movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as twins, is about two brothers coming home to Mississippi to launch a juke joint. It’s also a supernatural vampire flick that blends elements of drama, action and music.
“Sinners” composer Ludwig Göransson, actor Miles Canton and others who worked on the film also attended the screening.
“Anytime that filmmakers take the time out to pay homage to the Delta, especially, because we’re the root of music, the blues culture, that means a lot,” said Brandice Brown Williams, a theater teacher who brought two of her students to the screening.
The film is set in 1930s Clarksdale, Mississippi, but current day Clarksdale doesn’t have a movie theater, making it difficult for people to see the film about their hometown. Community organizers decided to change that, starting a petition to invite the cast and crew to Clarksdale and to collaborate on hosting a public screening.
“The love you have for Southern folk, Mississippians and Clarksdale came to life through your commitment to writing us right,” community organizer Tyler Yarbrough said. “We are ready. We are waiting. And we would be proud to welcome you back to where it all began.”
During the screening, the crowd was expressive — in response to various scenes, they gasped, laughed and cheered. Afterward, Coogler and others stayed for a Q&A.
One attendee, Cindy Hurst, praised the film, calling it a “really good visual representation of the beauty of the Black culture.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/30095441/AP25149760873214.jpg,,,2025-05-30 11:09:26.607447

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)A long time Eastern Kentucky Democrat has announced she is joining the Republican Party. 
Sen. Robin Webb, a Carter County state lawmaker who has served in the state legislature since 1999, was one of two Democrats left in the statehouse representing parts of Eastern Kentucky. The region was once a Democratic stronghold, turning to a Republican area over the last couple of decades. 
She and other Republicans said it was a sign that the Democratic Party isn’t what it once was. 
In a press release from the Republican Party of Kentucky, Webb said that she didn’t leave the Democratic Party, but “the party left me.” She added that her core values have not changed, just “the letter next to my name” and she will continue to focus on issues in rural Kentucky. 
“The Kentucky Democratic Party has increasingly alienated lifelong rural Democrats like myself by failing to support the issues that matter most to rural Kentuckians,” Webb said. “First and foremost, I’m a mother, a rancher, and a lawyer with deep personal and  professional roots in Kentucky’s coal country. As the Democratic party continues its  lurch to the left and its hyperfocus on policies that hurt workforce and economic development in my region, I no longer feel it represents my values. It has become untenable and counterproductive to the best interests of my constituents for me to remain a Democrat.”
Webb thanked Republican Senate President Robert Stivers, other colleagues in the General Assembly and RPK for “the warm welcome.” She said she looks “forward to continuing to focus on sound policy with rural Kentucky’s best interests in mind.”
Webb was elected to the state Senate in 2009 after serving in the House for a decade, making her one of the current longest serving members of the General Assembly. Her district includes the northeastern Kentucky counties of Boyd, Carter, Greenup and Lewis. 
With Webb’s switch, Democrats’ superminority in the Senate dwindles to six members. Republicans now have 32 seats in the chamber. She was often seen as the caucus’ more conservative member, sometimes voting with Republicans on culture war issues, like this year’s bill to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public Kentucky universities. 
Webb was also recently appointed by Stivers as the Senate co-chair of the Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force, which will meet during the interim session. She sponsored a resolution to establish the panel. 
Webb also often worked across the aisle to get legislation she supported past, particularly on agriculture and rural policies. Earlier this year, one of her bills gained passage in both the Republican-controlled Senate and House. Signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, the bill established new allied animal health professional licenses for equine dentistry and animal chiropractic practice.
Rep. Patrick Flannery, an Olive Hill Republican who represents Webb’s home county in the House, said in the press release that the party switch makes sense for Webb and her constituents. 
“Robin and I have always had an excellent working relationship,” Flannery said. “She has served as a mentor to me and many others. We represent the same constituency, and she’s making the same decision that many of our people have already made by changing her registration.
Other Kentucky Republican leaders praised Webb for joining the party. RPK Chairman Robert J. Benvenuti III said in a statement that he met Webb when he was a state representative. 
“I always respected that she approached issues in a very thoughtful and commonsense manner, and that she never failed to keenly focus on what was best for her constituents. It is my pleasure to welcome Sen. Robin Webb to the Republican Party,” he said. “Like countless other Kentuckians, she has recognized that the policies and objectives of today’s Democratic Party are simply not what they once were, and do not align with the vast majority of Kentuckians.” 
Kentucky’s Republican National Committeeman John McCarthy and RNC Co-chair KC Crobsie, of Kentucky, also welcome Webb to the party’s ranks. 
In the statehouse, the lone Democrat in the mountains left is Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty, of Martin.
Webb can seek election again in 2026. She had no opponents in the 2022 election.

On any given night, its rooms are filled with artists, dancers and creatives who have come to build community and hone their crafts. 
This is the home of the Briarwood Arts Center, the creation of Stephen Brown, also known as the hip-hop artist, producer and DJ 5th Child.
“During the pandemic, there was this unhoused population that had an encampment in front of the building, and the gas station next door had become a dumping site. There were huge piles of trash and tires and all sorts of stuff,” Brown said. “It was really frustrating seeing that as I pulled into my neighborhood after a long day of work.”
The building had been abandoned since he moved into the neighborhood in 2017. It was the remnants of an abortion clinic, turned daycare center, turned 3,500 square feet of deserted possibility. A property management company with property close by eventually bought and leased the building in the summer of 2022.
“When this opportunity presented itself, I knew that it had to be comprehensive,” Brown said. “It wasn’t gonna be just like one type of art. It’s not Stephen Brown Art Center or 5th Child Art Center. This is Briarwood Arts Center. It’s not about one person, but it’s about the community.”
Brown aimed to fill a void in the local arts scene. Popular hangouts like The Flamingo, a collective space and venue in Fondren, had closed, and there weren’t many places around for people who were into the alternative arts and music culture.
“I wanted to create something where we own it, within the artist community, that nobody could just take from us or remove us from or anything like that,” he said. “I didn’t know how that was going to happen, I just knew that it needed to happen even if I wasn’t the person to do it.”
He secured the keys later that fall, and soon after hosted an open-house, gathering ideas for what community members wanted to see. That culminated into stacked programming, with a calendar flush with events such as line dancing classes, Kuumba (Swahili for creativity) Youth Night, GoodEDvice ACT Prep Club and Crochet Circle. Most of the events at the Briarwood Arts Center are free.
“The work that we’re doing here, we can find other ways to make money, but I don’t wanna make money on the backs of the community members,” he said. “I don’t wanna price them out of these enriching experiences, so that’s why the stuff that we do is free.”

Each room at the center is designed with the artist in mind. There’s the Craft Kitchen, where visitors can develop their crafting skills, practice using a Cricut machine and learn how to sew their own projects. In the Ubuntu room, dancers learn movement through music, and community members can brush up on their self-defense skills. There’s also Cole’s House II, a music lab, and The Branding Lab is complete with a green screen and backdrops for photography practice.
“The space is really designed for folks who are still trying to figure it out, who have the genuine curiosity about something that they’re like, ‘What if I don’t get it right? What if it’s not perfect?’ Well, come here and screw up,” he said. “Come here and make all your mistakes so that you can fine tune it and take it to a bigger, nicer, fancier venue down the line.”
Brown hopes that his persistence and dedication to creating safe spaces inspires others in Jackson to imagine what’s possible for their neighborhoods.
“What I want is for someone in Shady Oaks to be like, ‘Oh man, we got an abandoned building right here in our neighborhood too. Let’s put our money together and start the Shady Oaks Art Center.’ Or somebody in Alta Woods or in Virden Addition to say, ‘Hey man, we got this abandoned building. How about we start the Alta Woods Art Center?’”
Briarwood Arts Center will hold events for 601 JXN Day, which is an annual weekend long celebration of the city coordinated by Visit Jackson. Residents can participate in the Briarwood Unity 2K, as well as a community clean-up. The center will also host the Siegel Select Block Party, a service program where volunteers will collect donations and supplies for residents who stay in the hotel, which is right next to the arts center’s parking lot. 
“There’s no fee to register, but this is more about a demonstration of establishing that camaraderie and dignity for the Briarwood neighborhood,” he said. “Before Fondren was Fondren, somebody had to care enough. Before Belhaven was Belhaven, somebody had to be the squeaky wheel.”
Brown sees the space he cultivated as one that reaches across generations. He said he’s seen visitors at Briarwood Arts Center from ages 6 to 94.
“It’s not just about the technical skill of sewing a stitch, but they’re talking about history. They’re talking about legacy. They’re talking about family tradition and all that stuff is being passed down through the arts,” he said. “The arts are a vehicle to bring these people together. Arts have always been, not only a time capsule, but also a means of resistance. They’ve been a blueprint for resistance.”

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

John Horhn far in the lead with nearly $200,000 in campaign expenditures since the beginning of the year.
The Democratic nominee for mayor reported raising $350,000 this year and holding less than $25,000 in cash-on-hand, according to campaign finance reports due Tuesday. 
Note: View a full list of reported contributions and expenditures from mayoral and council candidates and links to individual reports at the bottom of this story.
Second in spending in the mayor’s race was independent candidate and businessman Rodney DePriest with just over $72,000 in expenditures. He raised nearly $90,000 and had about $17,000 in cash-on-hand this week.
Horhn and DePriest face two other independents and a Republican, who combined have raised less than $5,000. Independent candidates Zach Servis and Lillie Stewart-Robinson reported spending about $1,600 and $1,300, respectively, while Republican candidate Kenny Gee did not file a report on time, but told Mississippi Today he’s spent $700 out-of-pocket.
A sixth mayoral candidate, conservative talk radio host and local businessman Kim Wade, who ran as an independent, recently announced he was dropping out of the race, though the city clerk told Mississippi Today that Wade did not file termination paperwork so his name will appear as normal on the ballot. He endorsed DePriest and did not file a campaign finance report on the deadline.
Another high-dollar race is the election for the Ward 1 council seat between incumbent Councilman Ashby Foote, who is running as an independent for the first time after being elected as a Republican, Democratic nominee Jasmine Barnes and independent candidate Grace Greene. The three have collectively spent nearly $90,000. 
Ward 7 Democratic candidate Kevin Parkinson far out-raised his independent opponent, Ron Aldridge, $45,000 compared to about $14,000, and Republican candidate Taylor Turcotte did not file a report, though the ad agency owner told Mississippi Today she has conducted her own advertising without donors and would file a report soon.
Two political action committees also filed reports outlining their participation in Jackson elections this year: MS PAC and Capitol Resources PAC, which contributed to incumbent Ward 4 Councilman Brian Grizzell ($1,000) and Horhn ($2,500), respectively. 
Both Horhn and DePriest reported that some of their largest donations, ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, came from LLCs. While Mississippi law limits donations from corporations at $1,000, LLCs that are taxed as sole proprietorships are not included in that cap. There are no limits on contributions from individuals or political committees.
Horhn’s largest donations include $12,500 from former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale and $5,000 each from a law firm located in Tippah County, Hern Law Firm PLLC, two Madison-based professionals, insurance executive Brian Johnson and physician Billy Wayne Long, and Jackson architecture firm M3A Architecture PLLC.
DePriest’s largest donation was $10,000 from Clinton-based equipment rental company HIJACK LLC. He also received $5,000 donations from Barksdale and several Jackson-based professionals including real estate agents John Dinkins and Warren Speed, lawyer Cody Bailey, surgeon Matt Jones, physician James Clay Hayes, and an executive’s spouse Mollie Van Devender. He also received $6,000 from Raymond-based property management firm MDMW Investments and $5,000 from Texas resident Matt Wiggins.
As is common in local elections, several candidates did not submit reports by the deadline, including incumbent Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes, who told Mississippi Today he would file shortly, and his opponent Marques Jackson, who said he would file Thursday after checking his bank statements to ensure accurate reporting.

(Photo by Bill Oxford/ Getty Images)The legislative committee tasked with wading through the many proposals brought forward this session to address the problems with the state’s clean energy credit program is advancing a bill that critics say doesn’t go far enough. 
On Thursday night, the Maine Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee voted along party lines with the majority in favor of an amended version of LD 1777. The bill Democrats advanced to the full Legislature asks the Governor’s Energy Office to develop a successor program for front-of-the-meter net energy billing projects sometime next year. The Public Utilities Commission would need to approve the plan, but only if the benefits to ratepayers outweighs the costs.
Net energy billing is a utility program designed to encourage customers to install or participate in small-scale renewable energy projects like solar panels by offering credits to offset their electricity bills. It was expanded in 2019 so customers can use renewable energy generators located outside of their property but within the same utility service territory, such as a community solar project. 
Front-of-the-meter projects include community solar projects and those included in the state’s current tariff rate program, which is used by nonresidential customers. If LD 1777 is enacted, front-of-the-meter projects would no longer be eligible to participate in net energy billing once the successor program is in place. 
“I hope that it will lead to the survival in a sustainable way and, perhaps, in a more economically just way for this really important set of programs and for the value that it has produced, as it certainly has,” said Rep. Sophie Warren (D-Scarborough), the bill’s sponsor. 
While the committee rejected other proposals, including those to repeal net energy billing entirely, it carried over some legislation such as LD 1936 that could serve as vehicles for further tweaks to the program in the next legislative session. 
As LD 1777 advances to the full Maine House of Representatives and Senate, proponents of solar energy fear these changes could harm the future of the industry.
Projected savings for ratepayers
During the committee discussion Thursday, Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said if passed the annual savings for ratepayers statewide over the next 16 years are estimated to be an average of $47 million from proposed changes to the tariff rate program and $20 million from changes to the kilowatt hour program. 
Currently, the kilowatt hour program is open to all customers and provides kilowatt hour credits on participating customers’ bills if they install renewable energy generators such as solar panels or join a community solar project, where customers receive a portion of a solar farm’s credits. The credits expire after 12 months. This program, in particular, has come under fire for providing generous incentives to solar farm developers that utility customers are helping pay for. 
LD 1777 creates a monthly charge for kilowatt hour projects starting January 2026 to offset the associated costs  currently passed on to ratepayers. 
There are 1,000 kilowatts in a megawatt and most community solar projects run between one and five megawatts. As of May 20, Maine has 300 community solar projects with a total capacity of just over 1,000 megawatts, according to the Governor’s Energy Office’s solar dashboard. 
The proposal outlines a charge of $4.10 per kilowatt of capacity for projects between three and five megawatts and $1.20 per kilowatt of capacity for projects between one and three megawatts. However, Warren said those may be adjusted to whatever number is necessary to achieve $20 million in ratepayer savings in the first year. 
The tariff rate program for nonresidential customers provides dollar credits for those who use their own projects or share in someone else’s. The Public Utilities Commission sets an annual rate for the credits, which also expire after 12 months, depending on the customer’s size and utility provider. 
However, Warren’s legislation establishes new, tiered tariff rates for certain projects starting January 2026. The new rates would vary depending on the project’s capacity. 
Republicans on the energy committee opposed the bill, with multiple of them saying it doesn’t go far enough to fix the problems net energy billing has created in the state. 
Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) agreed, but voted in favor because “doing nothing would be completely irresponsible,” she said. However, she said that if more needs to be done to modify net energy billing in the future to support Maine people who are struggling to keep up with electricity bills, she vowed to “be loud” about it — whether she’s still in office or not. 
Similarly, Rep. Chris Kessler (D-South Portland) said he was voting in favor “with a heavy heart.” 
Admitting it may make him a “unicorn,” committee co-chair Sen. Mark Lawrence (D-York) said he has been pleased with net energy billing.
Though she was disappointed the committee couldn’t come to a unanimous vote, Rep. Valli Geiger (D-Rockland) said her fear would be that the legislation goes too far in potentially deterring solar.  She said climate change is an existential threat and renewable energy is the only path forward.
Maine’s clean energy sector has admitted net energy billing can be improved, but has cautioned lawmakers against retroactive changes to the program that could undermine investor confidence. Many of them were disappointed in the committee’s decision to advance LD 1777, which they feel includes “drastic” concessions for the solar industry, according to a news release after the vote. 
“The Legislature today chose to both harm participants retroactively and threaten the future of the industry,” said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association. “While the program can certainly be improved, it should not occur at the expense of the people and businesses that invested in good faith for our clean energy future.”

Limited access to surgical care and rising insurance costs in Vermont led Dr. Christopher Bartels to open Green Mountain Hernia Specialists, and to offer health care in a different way.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Retired surgeon called to return to practice.","After a successful career as a clinical Professor of Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh and more recently as a general surgeon in St. Albans, Vermont, Dr. Christopher Bartels decided to retire. Dr. Christopher Bartels of Green Mountain Hernia Specialists in Colchester, VermontRetirement didn’t last long. In addition to realizing winters can feel quite long and dark, Dr. Bartels couldn’t help thinking about the long waits for health care and the rising costs of health insurance in the state, where 41% of Vermonters have insurance deductibles over $4,000 and fewer than 20% ever meet the deductible. He also knew from experience the high administrative costs to medical providers that came from managing submissions, denials and reimbursements.He was called to practice again, but he knew he wanted to do it differently.Welcome to Green Mountain Hernia Specialists and the Direct Care ModelWith a goal to make routine surgical care accessible and affordable, Dr. Bartels opened Green  Mountain Hernia Specialists in Colchester, Vermont. He offers minimally invasive hernia surgery, gallbladder removal, and hemorrhoidal banding in the office or a hemorrhoidectomy in the operating  room. He can also perform biopsies of skin lesions very quickly in the office and excise  skin lesions there too.  What is the Direct Care Model Direct Care surgical practice means that the patient pays for the surgeon’s fee, but  the facility fee and anesthesia fee can be paid out of their existing health insurance.

(Submitted) TOPEKA — The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is digging into allegations against Comanche County personnel, and leaders of this rural community are finding it difficult to answer residents’ questions about the situation.
Residents in this rural south-central county have been reaching out to their officials to ask what happened after former county clerk Casey Huck resigned in March and KBI opened an investigation.
Until that investigation concludes, it’s unclear how the county may have been affected financially by potential wrongdoing, said Joe Moore, Comanche County Commission chairman.
“It’s a small community. Everybody knows everybody,” Moore said, adding that trust in a small-town is important. “There’s going to be long-term effects.”
“We’ve got some ideas because of what we don’t have, but we don’t know the length of it,” he added, referring to financial mismanagement that may have occurred. “One individual who has resigned was elected five years ago.”
Moore said he couldn’t comment about what happened regarding the credit cards or allegations of financial mismanagement and whether those were connected to Huck. He said the county turned over all records to KBI.
Even as they await information from KBI, county commissioners discovered in May that four county credit card bills hadn’t been paid for three months when the issuing bank closed the accounts, commission minutes said.
In a special meeting May 9, county commissioners discussed the four closed credit cards and whether they could get those accounts reopened. The county owed $37,668.85 on the cards, and the commission voted to pay the total amount owed. The cards in question were used by county employees, including for county commissioners, the county clerk’s office and one in Huck’s name.
Commissioners changed some technical processes in May, such as revamping credit card use rules for county employees.
“We changed the limits on our credit cards,” Moore said. “We’re going to check the balance on every credit card every two weeks when we have our meeting.”
Moore said the county also is setting up processes that confirm charges that are made on the credit cards and that records are accurate.
“We’re not sure how deep this thing is yet, either,” he said. “Until we know what actually happened, it’s hard to set changes.”
Moore said he’s concerned about the county’s credit rating, calling potential impacts to it “tough to fix.”
Organizations like Fitch and S&P Global issue credit ratings for government entities. A  lower credit rating can increase interest rates on borrowed money and affect bonds that are issued.
KBI spokesman Dustin Wallace confirmed the investigation is ongoing. Huck did not respond to a request for a comment. In a previous story, she told the Reflector that she “made a mistake.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Comanche-County-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 10:01:57.321841

It didn’t involve picket signs, marches or sweeping legislative change. It was a picnic. In a park. With a rainbow flag fluttering from a folding table, a handful of brave souls gathered near the Snake River to celebrate who they were — out loud — for the first time in their rural town.
That picnic was the beginning of East Central Minnesota Pride. And, unbeknownst to many at the time, it was the first rural LGBTQ Pride event in the United States.
This June, Pine City — population 4,200 and growing — will celebrate the 20th anniversary of that event. In doing so, we celebrate more than a milestone. We honor the legacy of a place that chose community over conformity, compassion over silence, and inclusion over fear.
The story of rural Pride didn’t begin in a metro center with corporate floats or glitter bombs. It started in a town known more for fishing derbies and Friday fish fries than for progressive firsts. 
Back in 2005, when rural queerness was still mostly whispered or erased, a small group of LGBTQ locals and allies chose to be visible. Their gathering was met with curiosity, quiet resistance, and eventually, something even more powerful: acceptance.
In fact, the event drew enough attention that by 2007, the Star Tribune ran a headline that captured both the controversy and the charm of it all: “Hot-button issues with potato salad.” The picnic may have seemed simple on the surface, but it challenged deeply held assumptions about who belongs in rural spaces — and how loudly they’re allowed to exist.
Over time, East Central Minnesota Pride became an anchor — both for LGBTQ residents, and for the whole region. Today, the event features live music, drag performances, speakers and families pushing strollers past booths staffed by churches, businesses and nonprofits. The small town where it began now hosts crowd sizes that crack the thousand mark each year, including people from towns that still don’t have a Pride of their own.
What Pine City proved is that Pride doesn’t require a skyline. It requires courage. And community. And a willingness to believe that small towns can be big-hearted.
Don Quaintance, one of the event’s founding members, put it best: “Small-town Pride events are the ones that create the change. It’s easy to blend in with 500,000 of your friends at the Twin Cities Pride festival — and another to be one of 500 in Pine City. That takes a good deal of courage.”
In many ways, Pine City’s embrace of Pride helped shape its evolution. Last year, the town elected Minnesota’s only openly gay mayor, Kent Bombard — a lifelong resident who volunteered for the other big event in town, the Pine County Fair — long before running for office. The city continues to grow, becoming more diverse, inclusive and welcoming with each passing year.
Of course, it hasn’t always been easy. There have been critics, letters to the editor, even threats. But each year the rainbow returns to the town square at Robinson Park, each year families attend together, and each year more younger people see a future for themselves here — without needing to leave home to live authentically.
That matters. Because for every rural LGBTQ person who finds support in their hometown, we chip away at the idea that queerness belongs only in cities. We push back against the false choice between authenticity and belonging. And we remind the world that rural America is not a monolith.
As someone who grew up in Pine City and has watched this transformation firsthand, I can tell you that the real success of rural Pride isn’t measured in crowd size or media mentions. It’s measured in conversations between neighbors. In rainbow stickers on truck bumpers. In the kid who doesn’t flinch before saying “my boyfriend” at Walmart. That’s where the revolution lives.
There are now more than 20 rural and small-town Pride celebrations across Minnesota, and dozens more nationally. Some have grown big and bold; others remain intimate. All of them owe a quiet debt to Pine City.
As we gather again on June 7 to celebrate 20 years of rural Pride, we do so with gratitude — for the founders who risked being seen, for the allies who showed up, and for the small-town queers who keep choosing visibility.
Because visibility in rural America is powerful. It’s political. And it’s deeply personal.
Pride in Pine City may have started as a picnic, but it became a proclamation: We are here. We’ve been your neighbors. And we’re not going anywhere.

Vaccination rates for Alaska children have declined in recent years, the state reports. (Maryland Executive Office of the Governor photo)Alaska’s rates for childhood vaccinations are well below the national average, and the percentage of kindergarteners who had received all recommended vaccines was the lowest last year since at least 2017, according to a new report from the state Department of Health.
Only 54% of kindergarteners in the state had received all of their recommended vaccinations in 2024, according to a bulletin issued by the department’s epidemiology section. That compares to a national rate of about 93%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
There are six recommended vaccines for severe illnesses for kindergarten-age children, and Alaska rates fall below the national average for all six, including polio and chickenpox. For the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, commonly called MMR, only 76% of Alaska kindergarteners in 2024 had completed the recommended two-dose series, the bulletin said. That compares to a 93% national rate for the MMR vaccine, said the bulletin, which documented a downward drift in vaccination rates over recent years.
Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus, causing fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes, and can cause serious illness and death. Symptoms usually appear 7 to 14 days after infection. 
The bulletin has a warning: “Declining measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination rates in Alaska could jeopardize the health of Alaskans.”
Information about Alaska’s lagging childhood vaccination rates comes at a critical time.
Anchorage health officials on May 22 reported the city’s first case of measles in several years. The patient was an unvaccinated child, municipal officials said. 
The Anchorage case follows two reported earlier in the year on the Kenai Peninsula, one an adult who had traveled internationally and one a minor, according to the Department of Health.
Unlike the adult Kenai Peninsula case, the sickened Anchorage child had not traveled, said Dr. George Conway, the municipality’s chief medical officer. The child had not had contact with anyone who showed signs of having measles, such as skin rashes, so the source of exposure remains unclear, he said.
But the infected child did spend time at numerous public spaces in Anchorage before being diagnosed on May 21, including a trampoline park and the local YMCA, officials said.
No related measles infections have been reported in Anchorage as of Thursday since this month’s single diagnosis was revealed.

The graph from is from the May 23, 2025, Alaska Department of Health epidemiology bulletin titled: “Kindergarten-Aged Vaccination Coverage — Alaska, 2017–2024.” (Graph provided by Alaska Department of Health, Division of Public Health epidemiology section)
 

	Though measles was declared to have been eliminated in the United States in 2000, thanks to the vaccine, the proclamation may have been premature.
Currently, there are large outbreaks elsewhere in the nation, particularly in Texas and neighboring states. There were 1,046 cases and three measles deaths reported nationally as of May 22, according to the CDC. Almost all the cases have been among unvaccinated people, the CDC said.
Conway said the national situation makes the Anchorage case unsurprising. Reduced rates of vaccination around the nation and in Alaska have set up conditions for outbreaks, he said.
“We have a vulnerability and that’s manifesting itself in our susceptibility to cases,” he said. “Alaska is certainly no shining star as far as vaccination rates, but we’re not the worst off, either.”
There are a few states, such as Idaho, that have vaccination rates for kindergarteners that are below Alaska’s rates, according to the CDC. But most states have higher rates for all childhood vaccines.
Conway, who has four decades of experience working in public health, used two words to describe the downward trend in childhood vaccinations: “discouraging” and “disappointing.”
Much of that is the result of misinformation and confusion spread on the internet, including a debunked theory that vaccines cause autism among children, he said. That intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.
“It’s a much harder environment in which to give advice,” he said.
When it comes to measles, many in the public may underestimate the danger, he added..
“The thing about measles that a lot of people may not understand is it is one of possibly the most readily transmissible respiratory viruses, and it can cause serious illness and deaths,” he said.
The state Department of Health has a similar warning message on its website. “Measles isn’t just a little rash. It’s a highly contagious viral respiratory illness that can be dangerous, especially for babies and young children. Each year around the world, an estimated 10 million people get measles, and about 110,000 of them die from it,” the department warns.

	Use of the measles vaccine began in the 1960s. Conway said it is credited with saving 93 million lives worldwide since then.
Health officials hope the news about the Anchorage child who contracted measles – now recovering well – will motivate residents to ensure that they and their children are vaccinated against that and other diseases, Conway said.
However, Anchorage health officials have not noticed any rush toward vaccination yet, he said.
Sarah Aho, the Department of Health’s immunization program manager, said Alaska’s low rate of childhood vaccination is “a multi-faceted situation” that needs a broad-based response.
Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were among them, she said by email.
“We saw fewer children vaccinated early in the COVID-pandemic, initially due to fewer kids attending their well-child visits for routine vaccinations in 2020. Many of those kids are now in kindergarten and may have not gotten up-to-date on their routine immunizations,” she said.
A previous report, issued in 2023, also suggested that COVID-related disruptions have resulted in lower vaccination coverage, though for younger children.
Aho, like Conway, also cited bad information leading to mistrust of health science as a factor in reduced vaccination rates. The “increasing prevalence of misinformation might impact vaccine confidence,” she said by email.
Additionally, there are logistical complications in some areas of Alaska, Aho said. “Access to vaccines is a challenge in some communities, further exacerbating barriers of time and potential vaccine availability,” she said.
To address those issues, health officials are developing an Alaska Immunization Coalition and increasing educational efforts, including focused use of postcard reminders, she said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/stkw5017-1-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

Mike Kehoe expanding extracurricular opportunities for homeschool students.
The legislation, which has been filed every year in Missouri since 2014, will require public schools to allow homeschooled students in the area to try out for sports teams and other activities beginning in August.
Throughout much of the bill’s history, it couldn’t even get a committee hearing. By 2023, the proposal managed to barely pass a Senate committee in a 5-4 vote, with three Democrats and one Republican opposed.
Things changed in February, when it cleared the Senate unanimously — a rarity for the chamber. But then the House made changes to the bill, like prohibiting background checks of homeschooling families that receive money through a private school tax credit program. 
That change drew the ire of some senators and put the bill’s chances in jeopardy. But ultimately, the two chambers worked out a compromise and only three senators ended up voting no.

The legislation has had 10 sponsors over the years. Each points to different reasons the bill finally made it to the governor’s desk this legislative session, such as unrelenting dedication from homeschooling families and the fervor of this year’s sponsor, state Sen. Ben Brown.
Brown, a Republican from Washington, told The Independent that “the stars were aligned” for the bill to pass this year.
“It took a tremendous amount of work, both in the legislature with support from leadership and from the grassroots support,” he said. “Those were all key factors that just culminated and finally, after more than a decade, ensured that these kids get these opportunities.”
State Rep. Josh Hurlbert, a Smithville Republican who sponsored the legislation from 2021 to 2024, gave kudos to homeschooling families that came to Jefferson City to support the legislation.
“Legislators come and go,” he said. “But it is the families that have been the constant and saw it through.”
Hurlbert was a homeschooled student who played soccer in a league of students like him. He sponsored the bill thinking of students in rural areas who don’t have access to homeschool leagues, and his young, home-educated children who play in recreational teams with kids educated both in and outside the public school system.
His bill passed committee in 2021 and 2022 after families with home-educated children came to testify in favor of the legislation. Some families who submitted testimony in 2021 returned to push for the bill this year.
“We have had so many homeschool families and kids come over through the years to testify and tell their side of the story,” Hurlbert said. “They really made an impact.”
The bill’s journey in Missouri began in 2014, when it was first introduced by then-state Rep. Eiljah Haahr.
Haahr, a Springfield Republican and homeschool student who went on to become speaker of the Missouri House, participated in a homeschool sports league as a student.
“When I got in the legislature, I was like, ‘I don’t want kids to be the same way as me, where they want to participate in sports and they don’t have an opportunity to do so,’” he told The Independent.
The greatest opposition in 2014 came from the Missouri State High School Activities Association, or MSHSAA, which regulates extracurricular activities and sports in public schools.
Former state Rep. Kirk Mathews, a Republican from Pacific, picked up the bill after Haahr in 2016. It was not heard in committee that year, and Mathews told The Independent that MSHSAA was a big reason.
“(MSHSAA) had enough influence with leadership to have a bill not get advanced through the process,” he said.
The legislation continued to languish in 2017, sponsored by former state Rep. Don Rone, a Portageville Republican. He told The Independent that leadership continued to overlook the bill.
“We had some problems back then,” he said, “and (the bill) just didn’t get put on the front burners.”
New leadership in both chambers this year showed support for the bill that Brown “had never seen before.”
Senate President Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, sponsored the bill in 2022. And current leaders in the House told Brown they liked the legislation, a departure from the resistance he said he faced from the House’s former speaker, Dean Plocher.
Prior to Plocher’s term as speaker, the bill largely moved only in the House. But the Senate version has seen the most activity in the past two years.
“The narrative had kind of flipped over the years,” Hurlbert said. “The past couple of years, the hardest part was the House.”
Other things have changed as well. State lawmakers have been increasingly interested in alternatives to public education, passing and expanding a tax-credit scholarship system benefiting private schools.
“The entire climate towards public education has changed in Missouri over the last couple of years,” Mathews said. “With school choice being looked upon more favorably.”
MSHSAA has been largely quiet about the legislation, saying it would cause “substantial changes” in a press release but omitting details.
The legislation awaits Kehoe’s decision on whether to sign it or veto it. If he doesn’t take action by July 15, the bill is automatically approved.
“We had days where 50 people showed up from different homeschool families around the state of Missouri,” Brown said. “To be able to get this done for them, it was probably the most rewarding moment that I’ve had in my time (in the Senate).”

Last week the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives advanced a budget package gutting Medicaid spending by $700 billion in order to help offset the cost of extending President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy.
In addition to California potentially losing as much as $20 billion a year and 217,000 jobs because of this, millions of low-income Californians on Medi-Cal — the state’s version of Medicaid — could lose coverage due to the bill’s proposed proof-of-work-hours requirement.
As CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra explains, about 15 million Californians are on Medi-Cal, and roughly 29% of Medi-Cal recipients can’t work because of caregiving responsibilities, school, a disability or other exemption. The bill would require certain adults to report work hours, which could lead to, by some estimates, between 1.2 million and 3.5 million Californians losing coverage.
In an interview with ABC’s Bakersfield affiliate, GOP Rep. David Valadao, who represents parts of San Joaquin Valley, said the average person “who is working really hard” thinks the work requirements are “the right thing to do.”

Valadao: “For those who are able-bodied with no dependents and you choose not to try to make that effort to go get a job … yeah you’re probably going to be affected by this.”

But health policy researchers and advocates point to New Hampshire and Arkansas — two states that once imposed work requirements. Instead of increasing employment, the mandates left thousands of eligible people without health insurance within months. Both states have since eliminated the policies. 

Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy officer at Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a nonprofit health advocacy organization: “The program saves money through mistakes. And that’s not a good way to run social insurance or to run policy.”

All 43 California Democrats opposed the bill, while all nine GOP members — who represent a total of 2.5 million Medi-Cal enrollees — voted for it. The bill is now before the Senate and as currently drafted, work requirements would begin Dec. 31, 2026.

Status update on Trump’s tariffs: It’s complicated


Yusen Terminals at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro on Feb. 11, 2025. Photo by Joel Angel Juarez for CalMatters




From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
A federal trade court ruled the sweeping tariffs unlawful Wednesday, but that ruling was paused Thursday pending the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s consideration of the Trump administration’s appeal. A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., also issued a similar ruling Thursday in a lawsuit brought by two small businesses.

Kush Desai, White House spokesperson, in an email: “It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency.” 

The administration has said trade deficits constitute an emergency and invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify its tariffs.
The tariffs have had a big effect on California port activity, and remain in effect until the appeals court makes a decision on the lawsuit. Twelve states led by Oregon and five businesses brought on the lawsuit, which is similar to a separate lawsuit filed by California. It’s unclear how quickly the appeals court will act. 

Brian Peck, international business law expert at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law: “I would hope (the appeals court is) not deaf, blind and dumb to what’s going on with businesses.”

Peck also suspects the case will end up at the U.S. Supreme Court.
For businesses, the legal wrangling means continued unpredictability, said Darlene Chiu-Bryant, executive director of GlobalSF, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps facilitate trade, especially with Asia.



Trump continues assault on DEI, education

On Tuesday Trump posted on social media that he would withhold “large scale” federal funding from California for allowing high school transgender athletes to participate in women’s sports. But that’s not the only federal action Trump is threatening against California LGBTQ+ students, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
To reduce federal spending, the president has proposed cutting more than $10 billion from the U.S. Department of Education, and threatened to pull funding from any school across the U.S. that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. 
Under this directive, Trump only called out one program by name: San Diego Community College District’s LGBTQ+ pride centers. In 2023 the district’s four community colleges received over $225,000 in federal grants to support spaces and programs for LGBTQ+ students. But the money supports “initiatives unrelated to students or institutional reforms,” according to Trump’s budget proposal.
To avoid possible clawbacks, the district’s chancellor said the centers are planning to spend down the federal money “as quickly as we can.” Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs, who represents parts of San Diego and requested the grants, said Trump is “attacking the ideals that higher education is founded on, like free speech.”

Jacobs: “LGBTQ+ kids and especially trans kids are Republicans’ favorite scapegoat.”

A new district attorney is withdrawing from that effort.,"In summary
Evidence of racial bias in jury selection led Alameda County to review dozens of death penalty cases. A new district attorney is withdrawing from that effort.


Alameda County’s new district attorney is rejecting her predecessor’s recommendations to resentence people on death row — recommendations triggered by a historic review of systemic prosecutorial misconduct.
Records obtained by CalMatters show at least four cases in which District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson has moved to withdraw resentencing motions filed under Pamela Price, who was recalled from office in November. 
Price launched the review roughly one year ago, after U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria mandated that her office investigate 35 death penalty cases for prosecutorial misconduct dating back to the 1980s. 
His order cited “strong evidence that, in prior decades, prosecutors from the office were engaged in a pattern of serious misconduct, automatically excluding Jewish and African American jurors in death penalty cases.”
Price ultimately recommended resentencing 30 people, the majority people of color, after finding that their constitutional rights had been violated. Of those, 20 people have had their day in court and were resentenced to terms less than death under Alameda County Superior Court Judge Thomas Stevens. 
But that effort came to a halt when Price was ousted. Her resentencing team was disbanded, according to court records and interviews with former staffers. And the 10 resentencing recommendations awaiting a ruling were reassigned to Alameda County Superior Court Judge Armando Pastran, a former prosecutor.
The Alameda County Board of Supervisors appointed Jones Dickson, a former judge, to her post in February. Her office began filing motions to withdraw recommendations less than two months later, contending that Price and her team made flawed legal arguments and failed to sufficiently contact victims and their family members. 
The “motion is based on a substantive reevaluation of the facts of the case, legal analysis…consideration of petitioner’s prior crimes, and new information about the victims’ wishes,” wrote deputy district attorney Emily Tienken in one of the filings. 
The decision to reverse course signals one of the first major policy changes the office has adopted since Price’s departure. 
“It’s absolutely disgraceful,” said Michael Collins, senior director at Color of Change, a racial justice organization that called on the Attorney General’s Office to support Price’s review and launch its own investigation. “It’s scandalous that this has happened and now they’re trying to bury the cases. The people whose lives were destroyed — the people who were given unconstitutional trials are not getting any indemnification.”
In an interview with CalMatters, Price said her office was looking to achieve justice and it was not driven by politics.
“It was very disturbing,” said Price. “If this is the practice and you’re doing it in these types of cases, what’s to say you’re not doing it in other types of cases as well? So our concern was that we had a huge task ahead of us.”

The Alameda County District Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for an interview for  this story. At a press conference marking her first 100 days in office, Jones Dickson on Thursday did not directly answer a question about her stance on the death penalty cases.
“I don’t have a plan to specifically review any death penalty cases that are pending,” she said. “We are already in the midst of doing that. It looks like the prior administration started that process and so there are cases that are still pending that we’re reviewing and evaluating and filing motions on and doing the things that lawyers do. But I don’t have a policy at this point regarding choosing cases to pull for resentencing.” 
Jonathan Raven, an executive at the California District Attorneys Association, said not every district attorney is going to agree on a specific case.
“Any district attorney is always going to review policies and practices, and review the decisions of the prior district attorney, which I think is what the voters would want – or certainly, the board of supervisors,” he said.
Disparities in death penalty sentences
Decades of research has documented racial bias in the application of the death penalty. In a brief submitted to the California Supreme Court challenging the administration of the state’s death penalty scheme, legal advocacy organizations wrote that Black and Latino defendants are roughly six to nine times more likely to be sentenced to death than all other defendants. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom cited that legacy when he suspended the death penalty in California six years ago. But voters have consistently upheld the death penalty as a policy, and almost 600 people incarcerated in state prisons have been sentenced to death.
Allegations of racially discriminatory jury selection practices in Alameda County were first raised in 2005 by a former prosecutor in a sworn declaration. Roughly 20 years later, Price announced that her office had uncovered evidence of those violations. 
Jury selection notes disclosed by Price’s office revealed that past Alameda County prosecutors had been illegally tracking and striking potential jurors on the basis of race and religion for decades. 
In one instance, prosecutors described a prospective Black female juror as a “Short, Fat, Troll.” Prosecutors wrote of another prospective juror, “I liked him better than any other Jew but no way.”
Those findings served as the basis for Judge Chhabria’s order and quickly became priority for Price’s team, which had already been resentencing many other types of cases. According to Price and former staffers, the office assembled a team of victim witness advocates who contacted all of the survivors they were able to identify. 
Appeal reached California Supreme Court
The team spent months reviewing cases, including the conviction of Grayland Winbush. Winbush, a Black man, was sentenced to death in 2003 following the murder of Erika Beeson during a robbery. He was 19 at the time of the crime. In court filings, attorneys for Winbush argued that his constitutional rights were violated when prosecutors removed all Black prospective jurors and relied on racial stereotypes to characterize him as a superpredator. 
In January, Price’s office recommended that he be resentenced to 30 years to life, acknowledging that his case had “become a reference point in discussions of jury selection misconduct.” In return, Winbush agreed that he would no longer continue appealing his sentence. But roughly three months later, Jones Dickson withdrew the original recommendation “based on carefully considered victim impact and up-to-date legal analysis.” 
Attorneys for Winbush held that the office has no factual or legal ground to revoke its recommendation, maintaining that “withdrawing a recommendation on a whim or based on ‘a change in the political winds’” is not valid.
The motion “perpetuates, rather than confronts and remedies, the widespread race-based misconduct that led a federal judge to direct the office to review its death penalty cases,” wrote appellate defense attorney Rebecca Jones. “The original resentencing petition filed by the (Alameda County District Attorney’s Office) is a piece of its attempt to redress systemic bias reflected by the jury selection in Mr. Winbush’s case.”
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Pastran will decide whether to grant Jones Dickson’s revocation of Winbush’s resentencing recommendation in the months ahead. 
In another case, Jones Dickson is pulling the resentencing recommendation for Giles Albert Nadey, who was convicted and sentenced to death in 2000 for murdering a young woman. 
The case came up for argument in the California Supreme Court last year, around the same time that Price’s office had surfaced evidence of prosecutorial misconduct, but did not consider that evidence and ultimately upheld the death sentence.
In a divided opinion, the court looked at a prosecutor’s decision to dismiss five of six Black women from Nadey’s jury pool and determined the deputy district attorney had valid reasons to strike them, such as his perceptions of their political leanings. 
“We conclude in each instance the prosecutor’s reasons were inherently plausible and
supported,” the court ruled in a 5-2 decision, citing evidence from jury questionnaires and the prosecutor’s questioning of the stricken jurors.
In a dissent, Justice Goodwin Liu referred to the federal court ruling that directed Price to review death penalty cases. The “decision is particularly jarring given what has come to light in federal court regarding capital jury selection in Alameda County around the time that Nadey was tried,” Liu wrote.

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/05/medicaid-work-requirement-california-congress/,A proposal in Congress would require some adults to document 80 hours a month of work or school.

A proposal in Congress would require some adults to document 80 hours a month of work or school. Experts say the red tape and paperwork is so cumbersome that even people who work will lose their health insurance.



If Congress moves forward with a controversial proposal to require people to report work hours to keep Medicaid, more than a million of California’s poorest residents could lose their health insurance.
The budget bill that the U.S. House advanced last week includes a requirement that certain adults — largely those under 65 without children or a disability — meet work reporting rules. In California, about a third of them could lose their health coverage, according to an analysis by the research group Urban Institute. Based on 2026 enrollment projections, that’s between 1.2 and 1.4 million Californians.
As Congress looks at Medicaid for ways to help offset the cost of extending President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, imposing work requirements has increasingly been deemed as one of the most feasible and significant cost-savings actions. House Speaker Mike Johnson told CBS that work requirements have a “moral component” and that people who don’t work are “defrauding the system.”
But health policy researchers and advocates point to New Hampshire and Arkansas, where state-imposed work requirements failed in recent years. Their policies didn’t actually boost employment; they did, however, leave thousands of eligible people without health insurance within a matter of months. Both states have since canceled their work policies. Georgia is the only state that currently has work requirements. 
Nationwide and in California, about two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, according to the health research firm KFF. Another 29% care for children, attend school or have a disability that would exempt them. But health advocates say the additional red tape to prove employment could be so cumbersome that many eligible people would fall out of the health insurance program.


“You might say you’re combating waste, fraud and abuse,” said Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a nonprofit health advocacy organization that funds policy research.  But “the way you’re going to save money is by people inadvertently or accidentally losing their coverage. The program saves money through mistakes. And that’s not a good way to run social insurance or to run policy.”
Medi-Cal — the California version of Medicaid — provides health insurance to almost 15 million people.
Diana Alfaro, associate executive director of Central City Neighborhood Partners, a nonprofit that helps people enroll in public benefits and services, says some of her low-income clients in Los Angeles who rely on Medi-Cal are employed — but not always in “typical” paying jobs. They are housekeepers, gardeners, construction workers and others who don’t have a regular paycheck or a single employer.

So far, it’s unclear exactly what documentation enrollees would need to show if a work requirement is enacted. But Alfaro is concerned that it could be especially challenging for people whose schedules fluctuate or who are paid in cash and don’t receive a pay stub that shows their hours worked. Some enrollees use a copy of their taxes, a letter from their employer or in some cases self-attestation to verify income eligibility when first applying for Medi-Cal. 
“Some of them are doing those jobs of gardening or being a nanny or a housekeeper, and so they’re already going to have a hard time getting a letter that certifies the amount of hours that they’re doing if this were to pass,” Alfaro said.
House proposal requires 80 hours a month of work or school
The work requirement proposal is part of President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” which the U.S. House passed last week and is now in the hands of the Senate. All nine of California’s House Republicans voted in favor of the bill, while all Democrats voted against it. 
The current version requires certain adults to log at least 80 hours a month of “community engagement,” which could be employment, school or volunteer work.  As proposed, the rule would pertain specifically to adults ages 19 to 64 who qualify for Medicaid as part of an expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Pregnant women, parents and caregivers of young children, and people with mental and physical disabilities would be exempt. 
Rep. David Valadao, a California Republican who represents portions of the San Joaquin Valley that have some of the highest Medicaid enrollment, told ABC’s Bakersfield affiliate that work requirements are a fair ask. 
“For those who are able-bodied with no dependents and you choose not to try to make that effort to go get a job, go to school or volunteer, do something in your community, yeah you’re probably going to be affected by this, but the average person who is working really hard to provide for their family thinks that’s the right thing to do,” Valadao said.
But Rep. Laura Friedman, a California Democrat representing Los Angeles, said it is the responsibility of the government to help people stay safe and healthy, but work requirements would do the opposite. 
“They want to make it so hard for you and your family to access care with these onerous work requirements that you say ‘I’m not even going to bother, I’ll just try not to get sick,’” Friedman said during a press conference this week. 
Friedman said the proposed cuts and requirements in the House bill would lead to more uncompensated care costs for clinics and hospitals, which ultimately could lead to reduced services for entire communities.

As currently drafted in the House bill, work requirements would kick in on Dec. 31, 2026. States would have the option to start earlier.
In addition to the work rules, the House budget bill proposes several other changes, including requiring these enrollees to verify their income every six months, rather than once a year. A separate measure seeks to financially penalize states that offer non-emergency Medicaid coverage to undocumented people, even if it’s with state-only funds, as California does. And less federal funding may force states to reduce benefits or enrollment.
The federal proposals are on top of changes that Gov. Gavin Newsom is already eyeing that could also force people to lose their health insurance. In his most recent budget proposal, Newsom proposed benefit reductions, a premium charge and enrollment freezes for undocumented residents as the state deals with a projected $12 billion shortfall.
All of the proposals at the federal and state level are bound to result in confusion and disruption for patients, Alfaro said. 
“Last year we were doing a bunch of promotion around how easier it is to get health insurance,” she said. “And it seems like now we’re going a step backwards.”
The Arkansas and New Hampshire experience
Currently about 5 million Californians with Medi-Cal are eligible because of the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. The 2010 health law allowed states  to add adults without children or a disability to their rolls. It’s this group of enrollees that would be subject to the work requirements. 
The Urban Institute’s estimate of more than a million of them losing coverage in 2026 is based on multiple factors, including trends and experiences observed in Arkansas and New Hampshire.
In 2018, Arkansas became the first state to implement work rules as a condition for Medicaid coverage. The rule applied to adults ages 30 to 49 who had to show 80 hours of work a month. Within six months, 18,000 adults had lost their coverage. In 2019, a federal judge struck down the state’s work requirement.
State lawmakers in New Hampshire said they’d do a better job than Arkansas in rolling out their own 2019 work requirement, but they faced similar challenges. The state had a difficult time reaching enrollees and notifying them about the changes, news reports at the time show. On track to lose thousands of people more than anticipated, the state suspended its rule.
“Based on the experience of other states, even if you spend a ton of energy on outreach, a lot of people just don’t realize what they have to do,” said Nari Rhee, director of the Retirement Security Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center. “People have a bunch of questions: ‘Am I exempt? What do I have to do?’
“Even in New Hampshire, where they thought they were being gentle about the rollout, people had a hard time getting through (phone lines) to ask questions,” Rhee said. “So you can expect a pretty large percentage of people who could meet the requirements just fine, basically falling through the cracks and losing coverage because they just didn’t know or couldn’t get the information they needed.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052825_WorkRequirements_JC_CM_23.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 09:05:38.557257

San Diego’s community college district finds itself directly in Trump’s crosshairs: Its “pride centers” were the only items called out by name in the administration’s plan to slash more than $10 billion of federal spending on education.


Over 2,500 miles from Washington D.C., in a windowless meeting room at a San Diego community college, President Donald Trump’s fight with higher education is playing out. 
“This presidential thing, we will not let that happen here at Mesa College,” said Lucio Lira, the coordinator at the college’s “pride center,” as an audience of over 50 students, faculty and staff applauded loudly. 
That “thing” is a budget cut. President Trump is proposing to cut more than $10 billion from the US Department of Education for the 2026 fiscal year. For each national program he wants to cut, the justification is usually general, pointing to the need to shrink the role of the federal government or to undermine “DEI” (diversity, equity and inclusion efforts) and “woke ideology.” He singles out just one program by name: San Diego Community College District’s LGBTQ+ pride centers.
In California, more than half of all undergraduates attend community colleges, but unlike Ivy League institutions and major research universities, such as UCLA, community colleges have largely avoided Trump’s spending cuts and ire — so far. But they’re bracing for changes to come. 
In 2023, each of San Diego’s four community colleges received over $225,000 through a federal grant to support spaces and programs for their LGBTQ+ students. That money is supporting “initiatives unrelated to students or institutional reforms,” Trump’s budget proposal says. 
Those federal dollars helped Lira transform Mesa College’s meeting room into a banquet hall with tables, decorations and catering for a  “Lavender Celebration.” At this event, the college honored its LGBTQ+ graduates by offering each a pride-themed stole — or, as Lira says, a “sash” — to wear at commencement. Technically, any student can participate in the Lavender Celebration  and receive a stole because California’s Proposition 209, in effect since voters approved it nearly three decades ago, bans giving “preferential treatment” to students based on race or sex. 
After Lira’s speech, the college president, the district’s chancellor and one of the district’s board members spoke to the graduates, criticizing the Trump administration for singling out these San Diego pride centers, and for its February letter to colleges, which threatened to pull federal funding from any school that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion. Colleges across the country have cancelled or rebranded graduation events for LGBTQ+ students out of concern that these events could also violate the administration’s order.
San Diego Community College District Chancellor Gregory Smith said the pride centers are planning to spend down the federal money “as quickly as we can so it isn’t pulled back.” Meanwhile, Trump’s budget proposal requires Congressional approval, which can take months.
‘Republicans’ favorite scapegoat.’
Lira and his staff set up the meeting room for the celebration, draping each table in a lavender cloth and hanging streamers from the ceiling. Together with the balloons and the catering, including pan dulce with lavender-colored crusts, the event cost about $3,000, he said, all of it supported by federal funds.

The grants to San Diego’s pride centers were an earmark, requested by local Democratic US Rep. Sara Jacobs. A co-chair of the “Transgender Equality Task Force” in the House, Jacobs said Trump’s proposed cuts to San Diego’s pride centers have little to do with this particular grant. 
“He wants to be able to control what (colleges) teach, who they admit and hire, what areas of study they can follow. He wants us to be talking about LGBTQ+ kids instead of how he’s attacking the ideals that higher education is founded on, like free speech,” she said. “LGBTQ+ kids and especially trans kids are Republicans’ favorite scapegoat.”
San Diego’s LGBTQ+ center isn’t the only cited reason for cutting the roughly $200 million federal program where the earmark came from, the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education. Trump’s budget offers another, broader justification too, saying colleges and states, not the federal government, “should be responsible for funding institutional reforms and innovative programs.  These additional resources have allowed colleges and universities to fund ideologies instead of students, while still raising tuition costs.” 
Trump targets one other community college grant in California as justification for cutting another, roughly $100 million federal program, although without naming the college. “It is not the responsibility of Federal taxpayers to support a new ‘Guided Pathways Village, expanding the current Learning Communities and creating a new Ethnic and Pride Inclusion Center for historically underserved students, including LGBTQ+ students,’” the budget proposal says. The language about the “Guided Pathways Village” directly matches a 2021 press release about a $2.25 million federal grant to De Anza College in Cupertino. 
Already, his administration has slashed research funding to professors who study LGBTQ issues and prevented federally funded programs from recognizing non-binary or gender nonconforming students.  
On Tuesday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, threatening to withhold “large scale Federal Funding” from California because of one transgender athlete. 
Snacks and support at the LGBTQ+ center
When the pride center isn’t hosting events, it’s a hang-out space, where students stop by to grab a snack, study, and talk with Lira, who is a counselor. Outside the center is a rack of free clothes for students who are transitioning their gender. 
“Like everyone else I come here most days for the food,” said student Daniella Abbott with a laugh. “I honestly met most of my friends here.” She said she has seen the pride center grow in popularity since it first opened in February 2023. Now Lira said over 30 students come to the center each day. 
Christopher Delgado is also a regular. “When I first came here, I was about to be homeless,” he said. Lira recommended he enroll in a counseling course that’s specifically targeted to LGBTQ+ students, which changed his life, he said. “I was able to lift myself out of a bad place.” He is set to graduate next year but came to the Lavender Celebration to cheer on his friends. 
Delgado identifies as gay while others around him say they’re trans, queer, pansexual or bisexual. Some aren’t out to their families or say their parents aren’t supportive.
After all the speeches, Lira returned to the podium, where he announced graduates’ names and placed stoles around their necks. The students transferring to four-year universities announced their plans, and each posed for a photo with the college president and district chancellor.
Abbott was the first name called. Standing at the podium next to Lira, she announced that she’s headed to UCLA in the fall, though it isn’t technically true – at least not yet. “I got waitlisted,” she told CalMatters with a laugh. “It’s happening. They just don’t know it yet.”
Her back-up, UC San Diego, already admitted her and she said it offered a generous financial aid package — a requirement for her.

As part of the federal earmark, Mesa College gave out $500 scholarships to low-income LGBTQ+ students involved in the pride center, and Abbott was one of the many recipients. 
“When I found out I got the scholarship, I was like ‘Oh great, I can finally get lunch,” she said. It was a joke, she later clarified, but there’s a kernel of truth: Although she lives at home with her parents, Abbott is responsible for most of her living costs, such as gas and food. She received around $8,400 in federal financial aid in the past academic year, as well as $4,000 in state aid.
Many of California’s roughly 2 million community college students are low-income — some are even homeless — and like Abbott, they rely on federal aid  to cover daily expenses. In his budget, Trump proposes ending long-standing programs that offer academic counseling and cash to low-income students who are the first generation in their families to attend college. The Education Department has already moved to exclude students without legal status from accessing that program. 
Earlier this year, the advocacy association for California’s community college presidents and trustees asked the state to help offset the impact of federal budget cuts, but the state has a projected budget deficit, and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s budget proposals don’t mention the association’s request. 
Funded or not, federal programs at risk
The federal budget is even more complicated. With Trump’s proposal in mind, the Republican-controlled Congress drafts its own spending bill, which the president must ultimately sign. The House of Representatives put forward its spending proposal in April, but unlike Trump’s budget, the House version doesn’t mention the 2023 earmark to the San Diego pride centers or the US Education Department’s Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education.
That’s probably because the House is  focused on high-dollar programs, said Iris Palmer, the director of community college policy at the think tank New America. She said the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, about $200 million a year, is “not even a drop in the bucket.”
Even if Congress funds higher education programs that Trump wants to cut, Palmer said the administration could try to avoid implementing them. “They’ve fired everyone,” she said, “It makes it very hard to run grant programs.”
Regardless, the San Diego pride centers are planning to exhaust their federal funds no later than next summer, and earmarks are, by design, a one-time grant. All told, about half of the Mesa Pride Center’s budget comes from the federal earmark, said Lira. The rest is from the state, and the state Legislature has signaled that money will continue, at least into next year.  
Smith, the San Diego colleges’ district chancellor, didn’t specify how, exactly, the pride center will handle the cuts, though he said that some resources will “definitely go away.” 
Once the Lavender Celebration is over, a few students and volunteers remain to clean up, including Valerie Seng, a professor of medical assisting at Mesa College, and Sage Shevkolenko, a student and project assistant at the pride center. In a community where some students don’t feel comfortable going home or coming out, they’re a bright spot: Seng is Shevkolenko’s mom. 
“It means a lot,” said Shevkolenko, referring to her mom’s presence at the event, as they both helped take down the streamers and began dismantling the branded backdrop where students took photos in their stoles. “I know that a lot of families don’t have that privilege.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052025_Lavender-Graduation_ZM_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 09:05:38.557257

Re: “Trump administration restores dementia research it gutted as part of its DEI purge“
As a clinician scientist dedicated to understanding the roots of dementia, I’ve long believed that science, integrity and compassion must guide our work. Recently, these values were put to the test.
After years of progress under a federal grant researching vascular contributions to cognitive decline, our work was disrupted and nearly completely derailed. What followed was a difficult, monthslong appeals process that required legal and financial collaboration to address misrepresentations of our research, many rooted in misapplied diversity, equity and inclusion language. 
It was a painful reminder of how easily vital work can be threatened by bureaucracy.
Further setbacks, including the heartbreaking loss of 50 study participants in a single month, deepened the toll on our team. But we persisted, not just for ourselves, but for the millions of families impacted by dementia.
The community I work with and the participants who continue to believe in our mission have my gratitude. With recruitment reopened through September, our commitment to transparency and progress remains steadfast.
This experience has only reinforced my belief that research must be protected — because behind every data point is a human story, and behind every story is hope.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/030725-Science-Protest-Sacramento-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 09:05:38.557257

As teens across the country gear up for summer break, new data from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety is raising alarms about a deadly seasonal trend on the roads.
From 2019 to 2023, more than 13,000 people were killed in crashes involving teen drivers nationwide — and over 30% of those fatalities happened during the summer months between Memorial Day and Labor Day.
Dubbed the “100 Deadliest Days,” this period consistently sees a spike in teen-related traffic deaths, with an average of eight people killed daily in such crashes during summer, compared to seven on an average day during the rest of the year.
“Summer months are particularly dangerous as more young drivers hit the road during school breaks with many logging more unsupervised driving time than usual,” said Jana Tidwell, spokesperson for AAA Mid-Atlantic.

In 2023 alone, crashes involving teen drivers claimed 2,897 lives nationwide — with 860 of those deaths occurring during the 100 Deadliest Days.
Delaware not immune to rising death toll
Delaware has seen its share of tragedy.
According to crash data analyzed by AAA, 63 people died in the state in crashes involving teen drivers from 2019 to 2023.
One-third of those deaths — 21 in total — occurred during the summer months.

Risky behaviors behind the wheel
Teen drivers are engaging in a range of high-risk behaviors, according to AAA’s 2023 Traffic Safety Culture Index. Among teen drivers aged 16 to 18:

46% admitted to reading a text or email while driving.
42% talked on a handheld phone.
49% exceeded speed limits on residential streets.
30% ran red lights.
17% drove without wearing a seatbelt.
10% admitted to driving after using marijuana.

Worryingly, many teens believe that a serious crash “won’t happen to them,” but AAA stresses that even responsible teens can make bad decisions behind the wheel.
“We encourage families to take advantage of AAA resources like our driver education classes and parent-teen safe driving agreements to help set clear expectations for driving privileges,” Tidwell said.
Parents can make a difference
Experts say parents play a key role in promoting safe driving habits.
Modeling good behavior, setting clear rules, and staying involved in their teen’s driving are proven ways to reduce risk.

The Assembly’s top Democrat, who opposed that ballot measure, said he suspects changes to Nevada’s closed primary system are coming whether the political establishment wants it or not: “The dam is going to break one way or another. The question is: Are we going to be part of the process?”
To that end, Yeager is proposing Assembly Bill 597, which would allow nonpartisan voters to participate in either the Republican or Democratic primary. He introduced the bill as an emergency measure on Monday, a week before the end of the session, and presented it to the Senate and Assembly committees on legislative operations and elections during a joint meeting Thursday.
Yeager described his bill as a “pushing back” to Question 3, the election reform proposal approved by voters in 2022 but rejected by voters in 2024. That ballot measure, which needed to pass twice because it proposed amending the state constitution, was heavily funded by out-of-state election reform groups.
Those groups viewed Nevada as “a playground in which they can experiment,” Yeager said. “We know they will continue to attempt to exploit this issue” of closed primaries “to fool around with our elections.”
AB 597 is “much simpler” than Question 3. There would still be Republican and Democratic primaries. The only change would be that a registered nonpartisan voter could cast a ballot in one of them. (Question 3 proposed putting all candidates on the primary ballot regardless of political party, with the top five finishers appearing on the general election for voters to rank in order of preference.)
Yeager described AB 597 as a common sense solution that addresses the growing number of nonpartisan voters in the state. 
As of April 2025, 34.9% of registered voters in Nevada are nonpartisan, 29% are Republican and 29% are Democrats, according to the Secretary of State’s Office. The remaining 7% of registered voters are members of minor parties like the Independent American or Libertarian parties.
That means nonpartisan and third-party voters are the biggest voting bloc in the state. Yet they are unable to participate in the primary elections their tax dollars pay for unless they agree to temporarily affiliate with a major political party.
The Nevada State Democratic Party, which opposed Question 3, has not expressed support or opposition for AB 597. But Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat and the state’s top election official, spoke in support of the bill.
The Nevada State Republican Party is strongly opposed to AB 597, as they were to Question 3. Representatives from the state party and affiliated local party groups argued that allowing nonpartisans to participate in party primaries would dilute party values and invite interference from outsiders.
Opponents also argued the bill is unnecessary because nonpartisan voters can already participate in a primary by temporarily registering to a political party. Nevada offers same-day voter registration, which means nonpartisan voters have that option all the way through election day.
“I think that practically that just doesn’t happen,” Yeager countered. “People are not going to change party registration and then change back. They’re not partisan for a reason or not affiliated for a reason.”
Some election advocates worry nonpartisan voters may similarly be turned off by the process laid out in AB 597. Yeager plans to introduce an amendment to require nonpartisan voters request a political party primary ballot by “the 7th Monday before the election day.” (In real terms: That would have been April 23 for last year’s June 11 primary.)
Nonpartisans after that date would have to vote in person.
Yeager’s proposed amendment would also keep the state-run presidential preference primary closed.
Doug Goodman, the founder of Nevadans for Election Reform, has pushed for fully open primaries for more than a decade. He took a neutral position on AB 597, saying the bill is “far from ideal” and only “a small start.”
The bill doesn’t address disenfranchisement of voters registered to minor parties, who still would be unable to participate in a major political party primary without leaving their preferred party. It also doesn’t address the issue of voters not being able to cast ballots in the significant number of races decided in competitive primaries where the winner goes on to run unopposed in a general election. That is a particularly common occurrence in districts that lean heavily toward one party.
Sondra Cosgrove, another outspoken advocate for election reform in Nevada, took a similar position as Goodman, though she described herself as “reluctantly in support” of AB 597.
“In America elections belong to the people, not the political parties,” she said in a statement to the Current. “So, I plan to run a ballot question in 2026 to adopt a fully open primary so that the people of Nevada can discuss how we would like our primary election to be managed.
Many political commentators believe major election reform will only come to Nevada through a ballot measure backed by outsiders because the existing political establishment benefits from the current system.
The Legislature must adjourn Monday, leaving lawmakers only a few days to pass Yeager’s bill. If they do, it could still be vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has already vetoed one election bill this session.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/steve-yeager-2-1024x751.jpg,,,2025-05-30 09:05:38.557257

Dysfunction in the Missouri General Assembly might also mean the Show Me State has nothing to offer. A last-minute plan by Gov. Mike Kehoe to help finance stadium projects for the Royals and Chiefs derailed in the state Senate.
Missouri lawmakers return Monday for a special session to, among other things, pass a stadium proposal. But as it stands now, Kansas is in the driver’s seat to get, in theory, both the Royals and Chiefs. Notably, an affiliate of the Royals recently purchased a mortgage in Overland Park secured by the Aspiria campus, which is at 119th Street and Nall Avenue.
But economists say Kansas can’t afford both teams.
“You are not going to generate enough net revenue to cover one of the facilities, let alone two,” said Geoffrey Propheter, an associate professor of public finance at the University of Colorado Denver.
Propheter did say there’s a way Kansas could afford both stadiums, but that requires “cannibalizing activity from other businesses.”
A majority of Kansas lawmakers disagree, and say getting the Chiefs or Royals is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But whether STAR bonds can support one or two teams depends on who you ask.
 The Kansas STAR bonds proposal

STAR bonds, or sales and tax revenue bonds, are bonds that are paid by taxes generated in a bond district — hence the name. In a stadium proposal, taxes collected from bars, restaurants or any other businesses in the bond district would pay back the debt. Typically, STAR bonds are paid off in 20 years.
“(Kansans are) not going to pay a dime unless they visit the district,” Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Stilwell Republican, said last year.
That’s the logic behind the state’s proposal. Lawmakers last year approved a plan that would authorize Kansas to finance up to 70% of stadium costs with the bonds.
Supporters say the Chiefs and Royals would spark an economic boom that will bring new dollars into Kansas. All that economic activity would literally and figuratively pay off in the long run.
Almost 80% of STAR bonds projects are on track to be paid off early, the Kansas Department of Commerce said in 2024. STAR bonds have been used to finance other sports stadiums like the Kansas Speedway and Sporting Kansas City’s Children’s Mercy Park.
But STAR bonds have never been used for projects of this magnitude. A Chiefs or Royals stadium would be by far the largest project in the program’s history. And previous STAR bonds have only funded at most 50% of construction costs, not 70%.
The Kansas Speedway’s original bond was $24.3 million for a stadium that opened in 2001. That’s equivalent to about a $47 million bond when adjusted for inflation. Children’s Mercy Park received a $150 million bond before its 2011 opening.
Those figures would only cover a small fraction of the construction for a new Chiefs or Royals stadium. New stadiums for the Texas Rangers, Las Vegas Raiders and the Los Angeles Rams and Chargers opened in 2020. They had $1.2 billion, $1.9 billion and $5.5 billion price tags, respectively.
A 2021 audit from the Kansas Legislative Division of Post Audit found questionable returns from some STAR bonds. Notably, the Prairiefire project in Overland Park defaulted on its STAR bonds last year. Topeka Heartland Park and the Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City, Kansas, also failed to pay back their bonds. And Strataca, the Hutchinson salt museum, is only projected to break even in 43 to 118 years.
 Economists concerns

Propheter, the University of Colorado Denver associate professor, knows a lot about stadium funding plans. He said they don’t always work as advertised.
He said risk is unavoidable with these types of projects and they never start off profitably. It takes years to build the stadium and the surrounding district. That’s years of debt not being paid back.
Propheter said most of the money generated from the stadiums won’t be new to the metropolitan area. The Royals aren’t going to bring in tens of thousands of out-of-town fans for a Tuesday night game. But they will bring out tens of thousands of people who would already be spending money locally. These fans are spending money at the stadium instead of at a movie theater, bowling alley, restaurant or other local business.
Kansas wants projects financed by STAR bonds to attract 30% of their visitors from 100 miles away and 20% from outside Kansas. The 2021 audit of STAR bonds found that only three of 16 projects — the Hutchinson salt museum, Topeka Heartland Park and Kansas Speedway — met both goals.

A Chiefs or Royals stadium would likely draw a fair share of out-of-state visitors because the teams have been based in Missouri for so long. But Propheter isn’t convinced the economic activity will be worth it.
“A lot more people would travel to Kansas,” he said. “Would it be enough to generate the money needed to pay the debt? No.”
Nathaniel Birkhead, associate professor of political science at Kansas State University, also is wary of sales and other tax dollars being used to pay off bonds.
He said STAR bonds have struggled to pay off up to 50% of project costs before. Now, these bonds could pay up to 70% of one or more billion-dollar projects. That’s concerning to Birkhead.
“There’s some logic behind the STAR bonds,” he said. “However, I still fundamentally think it’s dishonest to say that something will pay for itself.”
Birkhead said the Chiefs, for example, are guaranteed no more than nine regular season games. The teams also could host concerts or other events to keep their stadiums busy, but there is no guarantee that happens.
He wonders how busy the STAR bond district will look when a game is not being played that day.
Then there’s uncertain economic projections. Ongoing concern about inflation and uncertainty around federal tariffs could make construction more expensive. A possible recession also would prevent people from spending money on sports events.
 Building a stadium district

Brian Mayes, a lead political strategist who also worked on the Vote Yes! Keep the Rangers campaign in Texas, said there was a point in his life where he might have agreed that stadium debt is hard to pay off. But Mayes, who has worked on the Dallas Cowboys and Texas Rangers stadium funding, said new stadium development is just different. There’s just so much economic development around these stadiums, he said.
Mayes said Rangers and Cowboys games always keep the businesses around the stadiums busy. But so too do the concerts, conventions and other stadium offerings. The Cowboys offer tours of the locker rooms, and people show up.
That’s not to mention mega events like hosting a Super Bowl.
Mayes remembers when the Cowboys left Irving, Texas, for the new stadium in Arlington. The old site of the Cowboys stadium still sits undeveloped. Meanwhile, Arlington now has a booming tourism district that is helping pay off other government projects.
“(We said) put the Cowboys to work for Arlington,” he said. “It was the economic generator, and the additional tax revenue that was made by the Cowboys helped the city pay for roads and parks and police.”
Scott Sayers is a senior technical architect with Gensler Kansas City. Gensler has worked on dozens of sports projects, including the Rams Village in Los Angeles, Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., and M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.
Sayers said more people want to spend time before or after the game hanging around. Maybe they are talking about what they just saw or wanting to enhance the pregame experience.
Sayers doesn’t have specific opinions on STAR bonds and whether Kansas can afford one or two teams. But he does know that the Chiefs or Royals can create a prosperous stadium district if they work toward it — whether that would be in downtown Kansas City or suburban Kansas.
The state already did that when it created The Legends next to the Kansas Speedway and Children’s Mercy Park. Sayers said that area used to be an empty field before becoming a bustling, dense shopping and entertainment district.
The teams can build thriving entertainment districts when they treat the stadium and its surrounding areas as one cohesive community, he said.
“People have expectations,” Sayers said. “No longer are the days where 7:05, the event starts. I get dropped off at 6:40 … I want to start those experiences at 5 o’clock, at 4:30.”

Diane Lewis, who has chaired the party’s Utah chapter for the last four years, didn’t throw her hat in the ring for another term in her role. But, with four other candidates eager to pick up where she left off, she’s hopeful for the future of organized Democrats in deep red Utah.
“I have never seen as much excitement and turnout at our conventions. I would say that our turnouts probably have doubled (in different Democratic events across the state),” Lewis said on Thursday. “New people, young people, people wanting to get involved, run for office.”

There are two major candidates for chair this year — former Rep. Brian King, a widely-known face in state politics for about 16 years who left his spot at the Utah House to compete in last year’s gubernatorial elections with no success, and newcomer Ben Peck, who has been behind campaigns that have flipped some red offices to blue. 
Jonathan Lopez, an IT technician who has been behind other Democratic campaigns and is also running for chair, didn’t answer an interview request, and the fourth candidate, Archie A Williams III, didn’t list his information on the party’s website prior to the convention.
Committing to such a role didn’t come easy for King, he said on Thursday. But, after seeing President Donald Trump’s election and bracing to witness another legislative session with a Republican supermajority, this time from the sidelines, he couldn’t stand the idea of sitting on his hands.
He sees that ubiquitous red presence in Utah politics as a monopoly that needs to be of lower intensity with more competition.
Strategizing before election, Utah Democrats plead ‘come back home’

“People may not realize how damaging it is to have a monopoly of political power, like we do in Utah,” King said. “The Republicans have a supermajority in the legislature. They control the executive branch with the governor. They control the great majority of counties here in the state, and it’s not good for Utahns to not have more healthy competition.”
Most Democratic elected officers represent areas along the Wasatch Front. However, King believes that Utahns in rural counties are ready for a change of policies to tackle issues they deal with daily.
“When you’re in the supermajority for long enough, like the Republicans are, you get complacent. You think that you don’t have to address people’s problems, you don’t have to work hard,” he said.
During his campaign, he has also seen more engagement from affiliates who, since Trump took office, have felt the need to step up, he said, “and push back against government overreach at the state level and the federal level.” 
While King has been around for longer and has an extensive list of flashy endorsements, including Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County mayors, among other prominent Utah Democrats, Peck said he’s “cautiously optimistic” about his chances on Saturday.



Let us know what you think...


 


“My message seems to really be resonating with people,” Peck said. “I know it’s going to be an uphill battle. Brian has a long history here in the state and in the party, but I think that people are ready for a change, ready to try something new.”
He knows what it takes to win in Utah, he said, highlighting the successful campaigns he ran that elected Natalie Pinkney in a tight race for a Salt Lake County Council seat, and Sheila Srivastava, the first woman elected to serve as Salt Lake County treasurer.
At 25 years old, he also believes the party needs representation from younger people, as support appears to be slipping in that group and the state Legislature keeps its Republican supermajority. 
“It’s hard for people who have been involved in politics for decades to credibly tell people ‘I’m going to fix it. Things are going to change now,’ because people rightly come back with, ‘well, why haven’t you done it yet?’” Peck said.
The day will start and end early at Ogden High School, with delegates convening in smaller caucuses to discuss issues like approaches to health care, education and labor, among others, and to elect new leadership, including the party’s vice chair, secretary and treasurer.   
Delegates will also vote on a party platform highlighting Utah Democrats’ belief in economic security, equality of opportunity and investing in the common good for all. Additionally, they’ll make their choice on two resolutions, one relating to veterans, and the other to take an official stand against presidents running for three terms. 
While Lewis is looking forward to her retirement, she is also excited about seeing where the party goes now.
“We have amazing leaders in each county party, and they’re willing to work. I hope that the new leadership of the state party sees that whole thing, and that they continue to build from where we are now,” Lewis said. “Because the only place we can go is up.”

Photographer: Andi Rice for Alabama ReflectorDespite spending a great deal of time on the issue in the 2025 session, the Alabama Legislature only passed two bills targeting those without appropriate authorization to reside in the country.
SB 63, sponsored by Sen. Lance Bell, R-Pell City, requires law enforcement in Alabama to take fingerprints and DNA samples of people without the documentation to live in the U.S. and submit them to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and the Alabama Department of Forensic Science.
SB 53, sponsored by Wes Kitchens, R-Arab, made it a crime, a Class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine, for people to knowingly transport a person without the appropriate documentation to reside in the country into the state.
The bill also required county or municipal jail administrators to investigate those placed into custody to determine a person’s immigration status and check with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security if the individual was issued an immigration detainer or warrant.
“Many of these bills were created to address problems that don’t exist in Alabama,” said Allison Hamilton, executive director of the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice. “The majority of these bills were copycat bills that were developed at national thinktanks and distributed out to different legislators around the country to implement in their states.”
But several other immigration bills stalled before getting a final vote.
HB 7, sponsored by Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, would have allowed state and local law enforcement to enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce the country’s immigration laws, an authority that currently belongs only to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office.
The House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee approved the legislation in February, soon after the 2025 session began, but the full chamber did not vote on the measure until April. The legislation did not come to a vote in the full Senate.
HB 3, sponsored by Rep. Chip Brown, R-Hollingers Island, would have enhanced penalties for people convicted of felonies if they cannot prove they have legal authorization to be in the U.S. A Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison to a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
Those convicted of a Class C felony would have their punishment upgraded to a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $30,000 fine. People who commit a Class B felony would have their convictions upgraded to a Class A felony, punishable by up to 99 years in prison and a $60,000 fine.
Individuals found guilty of a Class A felony, the most serious offense, would have had to serve at least 15 years in prison.
Other legislation would have made labor brokers register with the Alabama Department of Workforce and must then report the foreign nationals they place with companies through contract work.
Another bill, HB 297, sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Fidler, R-Silverhill, would have originally imposed a fee on international wire transfers, often used by immigrants to support families overseas. But the legislation was heavily amended to require reports on certain overseas cash transactions.
All the bills eventually stalled in the Senate.
One bill attempted to restrict those without proper authorization by limiting their ability to drive in the state. SB 55, sponsored by Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Josephine, would have prohibited people who have a driver’s license from another state from driving in Alabama if the state that authorized it did not review a person’s legal status. The legislation stalled in the House chamber after it passed the Senate.
Legislators from a slate of other states introduced nearly identical legislation, so Hamilton said the bills are not tailored to the problems that residents face in Alabama.
“If they were really trying to address it, there were other bills that other representatives introduced that would have been more effective, but this bill was really about continuing to oppress immigrant communities and make life difficult,” she said.”
But those who favor more restrictions said actions are necessary to disincentivize people without appropriate authorization to live in the country.
“The objective here is to present people here with rational choices, and if they believe they are not going to succeed in what they are doing, then they either will not come to the United States at all, or if individual states within the country adopt policies that make it clear they are going to be partners in enforcement, those people will settle elsewhere in the county,” said Ira Mehlman, media director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates for immigration legislation like those introduced.
Debu Ghandi, senior director for immigration at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, cited a  2020 report from the organization that found undocumented immigrants contribute almost $80 million in federal taxes and $41 billion in state and local taxes each year. They also pay another $315 billion annually nationally through spending.
“Many industries often rely on their hard, and often dangerous, work,” he said. “Undocumented immigrants, in fact, cannot receive social and Medicare benefits, but they have to pay into these programs through the payroll taxes that they are required to pay even though they are not eligible for the benefits that these programs fund.”
Hamilton said there are potential negative consequences of these bills for the state.
“What Alabama would like in that case is a lot fewer workers and a lot fewer people, fewer restaurants, and just a sadder place,” she said.

Joe Lombardo’s wide-ranging crime bill was heavily criticized at its first hearing this week for not only seeking to undermine previous reforms passed in 2019, but for being crafted without any consultation with organizations involved in criminal justice reforms.
“With four days left in session, I don’t view this as being a sound approach to policy making,” said Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada to the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday.  “It’s just, I think we’re out of time.”
Lombardo was absent from Wednesday’s hearing of Senate Bill 457, which he has deemed the “Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act.”  
The legislation was presented by the Washoe County District Attorneys office and George Togliatti, the director of the Nevada Department of Safety.
The bill reduces the felony threshold for theft from $1,200 to $750, and proposes harsher punishment for a variety of crimes, including for people charged with repeated felony DUI offenses and those in possession of child pornography.  
The legislation would provide stricter punishment for youth who commit repeated crimes against teachers or social service workers, while also limiting eligibility for diversion programs for those convicted of felony abuse, neglect or exploitation of children or the elderly.
The Nevada Crime Statistics shows property crimes, violent crimes and domestic violence have all decreased from 2023 to 2024. 
In a presentation to state lawmakers in February, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department noted that property crimes had decreased nearly 13% since 2023. 
“When I look at some of these increases to the threshold for theft, I just think that we are putting more people into a situation which is going to really lead to higher recidivism rates,” said Democratic state Sen. Rochelle Nguyen.
In addition to not deterring crime, the legislation’s opponents said that move, along with other aspects of the bill, could drastically increase the prison population at a time the Nevada Department of Corrections is experiencing a budget shortfall. 
There is a $42 million fiscal note attached to the bill.
“We heard already at a (legislative) committee meeting of almost $60 million in overtime being paid out,” Haseebullah said, on top of lacking money to make needed repairs including to air conditioning systems. 
SB 457 was introduced April 7, roughly halfway through the session. 
Lawmakers questioned how a bill calling for substantial changes to the legal process has had so little input from anyone outside of the governor’s team, law enforcement and district attorneys. 
“It’s a lot to ask any organization to anticipate that the governor’s office is going to bring a bill of this magnitude,” Nguyen said. “I can’t believe that this wasn’t worked on during the last 18 months, since the last legislative session, since some of the provisions look very similar to what was presented in the last governor’s public safety bill.”
Tim Robb, the Homeland Security Adviser for the governor’s office, told lawmakers that “we worked with anybody that reached out to us” and said they made “every effort to work with as many” people who were available. 
That apparently didn’t include public defenders from Clark or Washoe County, the ACLU of Nevada, or any other groups involved in criminal legal reforms.
“We weren’t involved in this at all,” Angela Knott with the Washoe County Public Defenders Office. “We never received any other communication until yesterday, when we got the apology for not being included in this process. There has never been any genuine effort by the DA’s office or the governor’s office to hear from the people who are most directly affected by this bill.”
Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen, who said he supports several of the bill’s provisions, agreed that “people that sponsored the bill may have dropped the ball” and the discussion around the bill “should have been going on prior to the hearing in front of us with four or five days left.” The Legislature is scheduled to adjourn Monday.
Still fighting those 2019 reforms
On the campaign trail in 2022, Lombardo vowed to undo legislation passed in 2019 that brought modest reforms to the criminal legal process. 
“A lot of our laws in Nevada were changed” by that, Washoe County District Attorney Chris Hicks told lawmakers Wednesday. “I think there’s a lot of arguments in support and a lot of arguments that can be made negatively about that bill.”
He added the governor’s bill this session, “seeks to strike the balance.”
Clark and Washoe County public defenders, the ACLU of Nevada and the Nevada Fines and Fees Justice Center prepared a counter presentation not only to raise concerns about various aspects of the legislation but to remind lawmakers why they passed reforms in the first place. 
The 2019 legislation came together after years of data collection that began under Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval in 2018, said John Piro with the Clark County Public Defenders Office.
“It wasn’t just public defenders coming up with ideas,” Piro said. “The Department of Justice came here to Nevada to study ways to reduce crime, reduce recidivism, and improve outcomes while saving money.”
At the time legislation was being drafted in early 2019, “we were 15th highest in incarceration,” Piro said, adding that data showed “66% of first-time non-violent offenders entering into the prison system had no prior felonies.” 
The state’s legal process not only threatened to explode the prison population and significantly increase costs — a data analysis projected the current trajectory would increase the prison system’s budget by an additional 9 percent by 2028, costing an estimated $770 million – it also didn’t address root causes of why people enter prison or focus efforts on reducing recidivism. 
The legislation lawmakers ultimately passed in 2019, which lowered penalties for non-violent theft and drug crimes while increasing access to diversion programs and specialty court programs, had several iterations as it incorporated concessions based on input from district attorneys and police. 
Similar input from public defenders, the ACLU and other groups weren’t considered in the legislation Lombardo is proposing now, Piro said Wednesday. 
There are some provisions in Lombardo’s bill, such as those addressing DUI offenses, that those against the bill could support, he added. 
“These are things that we could have told them had they come and talked to us before,” Piro said. “We’ve been here the whole time.”

Vivian Malone became the first Black graduate of the University of Alabama in its 134 years of existence. 
Gov. George Wallace had blocked her entry two years earlier. The night after her 1963 admission, she awoke to learn Mississippi NAACP leader Medgar Evers had been assassinated. 
“I decided not to show any fear and went to classes that day,” she recalled, even as white students refused to return her smile or make eye contact with her. 
One night at midnight, someone knocked on her dormitory door and told her there was a bomb threat. No bomb was found, but bombs went off later that year, not far from her dormitory. Despite that, “I was never afraid,” she said. 
She graduated with a degree in business management and joined the civil rights division of the U.S. Department of Justice. She served as director of civil rights and urban affairs and later as director of environmental justice for the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2000, her alma mater gave her an honorary doctorate, and she told students, “You must always be ready to seize the moment.”
In 2018, her hometown of Mobile dedicated a downtown street for her. She died in 2005 in Atlanta, Georgia.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05150718/May30-Vivian_Malone_registering.jpg,,,2025-05-30 09:05:38.557257

A new report from the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama says that the Rocket City remains Alabama's largest city. (Jeremy Edwards/Getty Images)A new report from the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama (PARCA) found that several cities across Alabama have stalled in population growth.
According to PARCA, in 2024, Birmingham, which used to be the state’s largest city, dropped to third place. Huntsville and Mobile have seen population increases.
The report says Mobile’s recent population growth came from annexations of neighborhoods within the county in 2023, which pushed the city’s numbers from less than 190,000 in 2020 to nearly 210,000 residents. However, PARCA reported even with the annexation, Mobile managed to lose 500 residents over the last year.

“The latest population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau reflects a trend we anticipated: continued population decline in some of the city’s older neighborhoods, despite the gains made through our successful annexation in 2023,” Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson wrote in an e-mail.
Stimpson said Mobile’s population decline can likely be attributed to the age of the housing stock and lack of large areas for new development and urban blight.
“We are continuing to make historic investments in affordable housing and blight remediation, but we know these issues don’t turn around overnight and require sustained focus and investment from the public and private sectors,” he said in the statement.
PARCA found that Birmingham’s population fell by over 29,000 residents from 2023 to 2024, while Montgomery’s dropped by only 289 residents in the same time frame. Steven L. Reed, mayor of Montgomery, said in a statement that PARCA’s data doesn’t reflect the reality of the city.
“While the report notes a population decline, we’re not fully confident in the accuracy of those numbers and are actively exploring the possibility of a mid-decade census count to get a clearer picture of Montgomery’s population,” the mayor said.
Reed said Montgomery has announced business expansions and new developments which have brought jobs and investment to the city. He added that Montgomery has also approved thousands of housing units and new houses in the city showcases the “growing demand and confidence in our community’s future.”
“We remain focused on building a Montgomery that attracts new residents and retains existing ones. From public safety and education to infrastructure and innovation, we are laying the foundation for sustained growth and opportunity. We’re confident in the progress we’re making today,” Reed said.
Other areas saw growth. According to PARCA, Brookside, a town in Jefferson County, grew by 13% from 2023 to 2024, the largest of any city or town in the state. This comes as a new neighborhood is being built in the town. 
Huntsville, Foley, Madison and Athens all saw population increases in 2024 making them the top four cities in Alabama to bring in the most new residents by numbers.
Huntsville added 4,100 new residents last year and the neighboring city of Madison and Foley in Baldwin County added just over 3,000 residents to their population. Athens, which borders Huntsville, added just over 1,600 residents to their city.

(Photo: Lynne Terry/Oregon Capital Chronicle)The Nevada legislative session will end in just a few days — and time is running out to pass legislation that’d save Nevadans millions of dollars on their pharmacy bills.
Senate Bill 316 would curb the power of pharmacy benefit managers, the secretive middlemen hired by insurers to negotiate prices with drugmakers and process prescription claims. Because PBMs dictate which drugs an insurer covers — and, thus, which medications patients can access — they wield immense power over our health care. And they use that power to line their own pockets at the expense of Nevada patients and small businesses.
Here’s how it works. Drugmakers offer insurers and their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) discounts and rebates on medications — in exchange for agreeing to cover a medicine and steer patients toward it. PBMs profit by keeping a share of those discounts and rebates, and also by charging administrative fees based on a percentage of the drug’s nominal “list” price.
Since expensive drugs lead to larger discounts, fees, and profits, PBMs have a perverse incentive to steer patients toward higher-priced drugs. The result? PBMs secretly extract billions of dollars from drugmakers annually, while patients pay higher out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications and are denied coverage for cheaper alternatives.
This dynamic is devastating for Nevadans, over 80% of whom report worrying about affording future healthcare costs. PBMs’ manipulation of drug coverage often strips doctors and patients of the ability to decide which medication is best for an individual’s healthcare needs.
And PBMs harm patients in other ways as well — most notably by putting trusted, local community pharmacies out of business and forcing Nevadans to travel much further to pick up prescriptions.
PBMs often reimburse these independent pharmacies much less than their affiliated pharmacies. A Federal Trade Commission report examined reimbursement for two drugs and found that PBMs paid their affiliated pharmacies 20 to 40 times more than the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost. In some cases, independent pharmacies actually lose money every time a patient fills a prescription due to PBM clawbacks and fees.
This has put immense financial strain on our state’s independent pharmacies, which filled 5 million prescriptions in 2023. Indeed, over the last decade, about one in ten rural independent pharmacies across the nation have closed. That limits patient choice and makes it harder for Nevadans to fill urgently needed prescriptions.
PBMs’ exploitative practices also hurt small businesses in Nevada, which are already operating on thin margins. As the costs of prescriptions and employee health plans rise, small companies are forced to cut back on expansion plans, hiring, and employee benefits.
SB 316 would put an end to this abuse and enact reforms that Nevadans overwhelmingly support. For starters, the bill would tie a PBM’s compensation to the value of the service it provides, instead of the list price of medications. That would eliminate PBMs’ incentive to favor more expensive drugs over lower-cost ones. In a recent poll, 85% of state residents supported such a policy.
The legislation would also create more transparency and accountability over PBM practices. Today, the middlemen often operate in a black box, with patients and other health plans unaware of the consolidation and conflicts of interest that dictate PBM practices. SB 316 would establish a duty of care, requiring PBMs to put patients’ interests ahead of their own. Roughly nine in ten Nevadans are in favor of such a provision, according to the new poll.
The bill would further prohibit PBMs from reimbursing any pharmacy less than it reimburses an affiliated pharmacy. That would stop us from losing yet more independent pharmacies that provide critical services to patients across the state.
SB 316 would ensure much-needed oversight of PBMs and restore fairness to the marketplace in the state. More than 80% of Nevadans are very or extremely concerned that no such oversight currently exists.
Legislators must not let the session expire without easing those concerns — or preventing PBMs from exploiting Nevada businesses and patients for their own financial gain.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CVS-pharmacy-front-Lynne-Terry-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 11:09:26.607447

The movement toward greater consolidation is movement away from local input, community engagement and informed democracy.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David F. Kelley: On education reform, trust Vermont values.","This commentary is by David F. Kelley of Greensboro. He is an attorney and the former chair of the Hazen Union School Board. He was part of the legal team that represented more than two dozen rural elementary school districts that appealed forced mergers under Act 46.The road to education reform in Vermont has been long and winding, and we are at another crossroads. Driven by increasingly unaffordable property tax bills, House bill H.454 attempts to use district consolidation as a cost-saving measure along with a funding formula change meant to contain spending.With no proof that this tactic will actually save money (and plenty that suggests it will not), this legislation heads us dangerously in the wrong direction. We need to look both ways before we go any further down this road.H.454 proposes a massive transfer of power. If it is enacted, taxpayers will no longer get to vote on their school budgets. Rather than the checks and balances between local and state power, school spending will be determined by the governor and the Agency of Education.Additionally, this legislation will not only take away voters’ power to control local spending, but also the power over whether their school remains open. It severs ties between voters, communities, spending and governance decisions.READ MORE
It’s understandable that many superintendents want greater consolidation: bigger districts, fewer school boards, fewer meetings and more control will make their jobs easier. But advantages for central office come with costs.Those school boards and meetings instill leaders with an understanding of the communities they serve. The movement toward greater consolidation is movement away from local input, community engagement and informed democracy. The Legislature and administration spent the winter largely stymied on education reform, attempting to choose from among vastly unwieldy, universally unpopular proposals that do not address the real issues. Policymakers have become obsessed with creating a system with a larger scale.But Vermonters understand that size and scale have little effect on either fiscal responsibility or academic quality. Quality and cost should be the indicators receiving the most scrutiny. High-quality, cost-effective schools and districts come in all shapes and sizes.As we have already seen in Roxbury and Westford, the gravitational pull of the big towns on consolidated boards causes the closure of rural schools. Quite frankly there is no data to suggest that dynamic solves either our fiscal or academic problems. In fact, it may exacerbate them.But answers have emerged from a source that should not surprise us: our communities. Common-sense, bottom-up solutions are being offered by the 97 towns that make up the Rural School Community Alliance. RSCA has offered testimony that is well-documented, fact-based and articulately presented. The Alliance reminds us that elementary-aged children should be educated close to home, and that elementary schools are fundamental to a thriving community. They warn that closing rural schools will not fix Vermont’s problems and could create damaging new ones. They stress the need for an education funding system that provides immediate tax relief to low- and middle-income Vermonters and distributes education funds equitably, while strengthening high-quality education.Before we pass a bill, we need to:1) Carefully consider Vermont data. We need fiscal analysis of each district to know what produces good outcomes at sustainable costs and what doesn’t.2) Implement a public school approval and certification process using professional panels made up of Vermont experts who visit schools to make recommendations about budgets as well as programs.3) Model the real financial impacts of any changes including accounting for transition costs. Guessing about future tax impacts is not good enough. It’s dangerous to assume scale will deliver on cost effectiveness and quality.Local school boards have long delivered and managed the tough decisions Gov. Phil Scott has called for; unfortunately, the real cost drivers are out of school boards’ control. Clearly, there is real work to be done at the state level.Legislators should focus on getting health care costs under control and tackling the education fund by moving non-education needs into the general fund where they belong. They can address immediate tax relief for moderate income households by updating the outdated income sensitivity thresholds (so-called “tax cliffs”) without waiting to rewrite the entire funding formula. Vermont values grew out of a rural economy and a deep, abiding commitment to community. Community is the singular, non-monetizable asset that has long helped Vermont’s policies work at a human scale. Vermont’s schools reflect this history.Our system has evolved over generations springing from community, history and geography, and we need to respect the organic connections between people and place. Rather than attempting to control these from the top down, we need to listen to their messages and utilize their strengths.Above all, if we want to build a healthier education system, then we need to help Vermont get back to her most fundamental values. We need to reinvest in grassroots democracy with a renewed vitality in local decision-making.Read the story on VTDigger here:  David F.

A fairer tax system, based largely on ability to pay, would help us weather challenges while we restructure our education delivery in a more thoughtful way.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Zuckerman: Governor 1, Legislature 0.","This commentary is by David Zuckerman of Hinesburg, former Vermont lieutenant governor.The recently signed property tax bill, H.491, kicks the can down the road and sets up the governor to easily blame the Legislature for an even bigger increase in 2026. The Vermont Legislature has failed to stand up for Vermont’s education system, failed working-class taxpayers and failed to support our rural schools.The governor has effectively used property taxes as a weapon to propose deep cuts to the education system rather than addressing the underlying issues in his own budget and our soaring healthcare costs. Additionally, Gov. Scott has shifted rising human services costs onto the education fund for years and then successfully blamed the Legislature for tax increases.School taxes are too high for working and middle class Vermonters. Instead of focusing on fixing this problem, the governor has used this moment to propose an education overhaul that will lead to more pain for Vermont taxpayers and will result in the closure of many community schools.The bill that was just passed and signed by the governor uses over $100 million in one-time funds to reduce property taxes this year. This means in 2026, Vermont will have a huge increase like last year. While the governor and Legislature have delayed the pain, the bill they just passed does nothing to solve the problem. Instead, they could have rebalanced the burden more fairly by expanding income sensitivity to adjust for inflation. This has not been done for decades. Implementing this single change would have saved working Vermonters money this year and into the future. Additionally, they could have increased taxes on year-round second homes. There are about 51,000 “seasonal, occasional use, or vacation homes” in Vermont. Adding an average of $1,000 in additional property tax for those that are habitable year-round would have provided significant annual tax relief for working class Vermonters while funding the needs of our most vulnerable children.Instead, with this year’s yield bill, and policy moves towards a foundation formula, the Legislature has caved in a direction that will result in the forced closing of many small rural schools, reduced funding capacity for property-poor towns and will harm Vermont’s education quality. Given the federal funding disaster caused by President Trump, next year there will be no “surplus funds” to artificially lower taxes. The governor will use the tax pressure to continue to push his radical consolidation plan (with its fake savings that will not materialize,) and the political pressure will force the Democrats to cave. Meanwhile, taxes will still go up dramatically, and Democrats in Vermont will again underperform at the polls. I served in the Vermont Legislature for 18 years. Unfortunately, we could never get the majority to seriously consider many proposals to reform the tax system that would reduce the burden on working and middle-class taxpayers. Under the current foundation formula idea these same Vermonters will continue to pay an even larger share of their income than their higher-income neighbors.As costs such as health care, school building maintenance and repairs, computers, etc. inevitably rise, we will continue to struggle with these issues. A fairer tax system, based largely on ability to pay, would help us weather these challenges while we restructure our education delivery in a more thoughtful way.Of course, the biggest solution to Vermont’s fiscal challenges is for more young people to move here. Destroying our public school system is not the way to do that. Using the one-time and other more long-term resources to truly invest in affordable housing we would provide our employers with the workers they need, populate the schools with more children and share the tax burden.Over the next four years, as more people across the country seek places to live where the politics are less toxic, the climate is more moderate and the sense of community is thriving, many of them will choose Vermont if, and only if, we maintain and improve our high quality local schools rather than destroy them.Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Zuckerman: Governor 1, Legislature 0.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-30 08:00:02.136625

We are updating our approach to prescribing controlled substances at the People’s Health & Wellness Clinic.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Barlow and Allan Ramsay: A safer path forward for patients and our community.","This commentary is by Daniel Barlow — executive director of the People’s Health & Wellness Clinic in Barre and board chair of Vermont’s Free and Referral Clinic association — and Dr. Allan Ramsay, medical director at the People’s Health & Wellness Clinic.At the People’s Health & Wellness Clinic, we’ve always been guided by a simple mission: to care for our neighbors with compassion and dignity, regardless of their ability to pay. For over 30 years, we’ve offered free medical, dental and wellness services to thousands of central Vermonters who might otherwise go without. Our work is built on trust — between patients and providers, between the clinic and the community. As the world around us has changed, so too have the needs of the people we serve. Today, many of our patients face far more complex challenges than we saw a decade ago. Homelessness, addiction, trauma, food insecurity, untreated chronic illness — these aren’t just background issues; they shape our patients’ lives and health in profound ways. We are proud to stand beside them through it all.It’s with this understanding — and a deep commitment to safety — that we are updating our approach to prescribing controlled substances at PHWC. This new policy has been approved by our board of directors and will take effect on July 1.Let us be clear: this is not about denying care. It’s about providing care responsibly in a way that protects everyone — patients, volunteers and the community.For many years, PHWC has not prescribed opioids. That long standing policy remains in place and reflects our commitment to safe, appropriate care in a volunteer-based setting. This new policy builds on that foundation and strengthens our guidelines around other controlled substances, such as benzodiazepines and stimulants. Vermont has not been immune to the devastating effects of the opioid epidemic. We’ve lost too many lives to addiction and overdose — including in small towns like ours, where everyone feels the ripple effects. What began with prescription opioids has evolved into more dangerous and deadly substances like fentanyl. But the problem doesn’t end there.Medications like benzodiazepines (often prescribed for anxiety) and stimulants (used for ADHD) also carry high risks of misuse, dependency and diversion, especially when not closely monitored. When combined with opioids or used improperly, these medications can become lethal.In a free clinic setting like ours, where patients may lack consistent housing, stable support networks or regular access to primary care, those risks increase. That’s why our updated policy limits the use of controlled substances to short-term situations, under clear guidelines.Patients must complete a full evaluation, sign a medication agreement and commit to regular follow-ups. We will check the Vermont Prescription Monitoring System before each prescription or renewal and may require drug screenings. All prescriptions must come from, and be monitored by, the same provider. We know medications can be helpful — even essential — but they must be used carefully. That’s why we’re emphasizing safer options first: non-controlled medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen and non-drug approaches such as physical therapy, counseling and mindfulness. These approaches often offer real, long-term relief with far less risk.This policy is not only about medication — it’s about our clinic’s identity. PHWC is a place where people come for thoughtful, compassionate care. Our staff and volunteers give their time because they believe in community health. It’s our responsibility to make sure that the care we provide keeps everyone — patients, volunteers and staff — safe.We also understand that many in our community live with addiction or are in recovery. There is no judgment here — only support. Patients in need of treatment for substance use disorder will be referred to providers who specialize in that care. We’re also working to strengthen partnerships with mental health, housing and recovery programs to better serve our patients’ full range of needs.In developing this new policy, we’ve drawn on best practices from across Vermont and beyond. We’ve consulted with pharmacists, primary care providers and mental health professionals.Most importantly, we’ve listened — to our team, our board and our patients.Change can be challenging, but we believe this change is necessary. It reflects who we are and the kind of care our patients deserve — thoughtful, careful and centered on long-term well-being.If you’re a patient at PHWC and have questions, please talk to your provider. We’re here to listen. We’re here to help. As always, we remain committed to serving central Vermont with dignity, respect and heart.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Barlow and Allan Ramsay: A safer path forward for patients and our community.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-30 08:00:02.136625

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)ABERDEEN — For the past few weeks, Kendrick Rochelle has been going to Washington’s overcrowded youth prison in Chehalis to build relationships with the young men held there.
Rochelle is trying to recruit them to join a leadership program at a new juvenile detention center called Harbor Heights on the grounds of an adult prison near Aberdeen, where he’ll serve as superintendent. Harbor Heights is set to open June 9.
He eats lunch with the young men incarcerated at Green Hill School, and just tries to be consistently present. At first, some were skeptical. But Rochelle says he’s been getting two or three applications per day from the men trying to get out of the poor conditions at Green Hill and better themselves.
Rochelle, who grew up without a father, started his career as a correctional officer before moving into criminal justice leadership roles in Ohio, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas.
The goal of his visits is to “show them a man with the same background as them that made it,” he said.
State officials showed off Harbor Heights on Thursday. The facility will start with eight men transferring from Green Hill, growing to a maximum capacity of 46 by the end of the fall, state Department of Children, Youth and Families Secretary Tana Senn said.
Harbor Heights will be open to those between the ages of 18 and 25 who are considered medium security. 
While on the Stafford Creek Corrections Center campus, Senn’s agency will run the facility. Department of Corrections Secretary Tim Lang likened his agency to a landlord. 
Harbor Heights will be a six-month rotation with perks for those chosen to move there. Each man will get his own room, with a small TV. 
Each room has a window, one of the biggest renovations made to the former adult prison isolation unit. The windows were previously opaque frosted glass. 
The facility has drawn criticism from some who say retrofitting the long-unused Department of Corrections unit is like “putting lipstick on a pig.” The unit toured Thursday features painted aquamarine accents, rooms filled with board games and books, photographs of beach scenes and motivational quotes throughout. 
“Welcome to the Harbor; where your future will take you to new Heights,” reads one. 
While at Harbor Heights, the young men will be able to develop leadership skills, receive therapy and learn to be a mentor before either returning to Green Hill or being released from custody. They’ll also have expanded opportunities for visitors and access to a three-quarter-acre yard.
Senn sees potential for “a hopeful place that provides a vision for what community can be” after release.
The facility provides small relief for the overcrowding that has enveloped Washington’s juvenile detention system. At Green Hill, one of the state’s two prisons for juvenile offenders, the population has fluctuated between 220 and 240, despite a safe operational capacity of 180, for many months.
For the young people held there, who are 17 and older, this has meant unsafe conditions wrought with fights and drugs, as well as more time isolated in their rooms without enough staff to supervise the programs that tend to make juvenile facilities more appealing than prisons. 
The crowding has come amid ballooning juvenile crime, with state law also changing in recent years to send young adults convicted of crimes committed under age 18 to youth detention, instead of adult prison, until they turn 25. 
Senn, a former state representative, calls the Harbor Heights opening an “important start.”
“This is not going to solve the overcrowding issue at Green Hill,” she acknowledged, noting her old colleagues in the Legislature need to provide money for additional capacity.
The two-year budget Gov. Bob Ferguson signed last week included $25 million to run Harbor Heights, but lawmakers failed to deliver a policy solution to address the broader crowding crisis, despite bipartisan interest.
Lawmakers set aside another $3 million to scout new medium-security juvenile detention facilities. One top prospect has been a minimum-security women’s prison in Mason County, which is slated for closure.
But any new facility would be at least four years out, Senn has said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3386-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 08:00:02.136625

Colton George felt sick. The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletter Inside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown (D-Ohio). “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
The high cost of foodborne illnesses
Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas. “This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak involving peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
‘Life or death for our son’ 
E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”
Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

(Getty Images)Most people are talking about work requirements for federal assistance like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). But it’s another provision that could have a much bigger impact.
More than 600,000 Hoosiers received $1.44 billion in financial assistance to buy food in fiscal year 2024, mostly families with children who can’t make ends meet. That cost-sharing language for the federal program threatens to break Indiana’s budget or take out the program altogether.
A key provision in the federal reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House and now is being vetted in the Senate would require states to have skin in the game for SNAP. Right now, the benefits are 100% covered by the federal government with the state picking up half of the administrative costs.
But the proposal would require some states to cover as much as 25% of the benefits cost starting in 2028, depending on each state’s error rate. States with the highest error rates would pay more as a “state quality control incentive” to crack down on fraud and abuse.

The seven states with error rates below 6% would only need to cover 5% of the tab under the current version of the bill. But Indiana’s 10.5% error rate puts it into the highest tier for a match rate — even though it falls below the national average rate of 11.68%.
That means Indiana could be on the hook for as much as $360 million a year.
Coming off a budget session where state lawmakers had to cut higher education funding, child care aid and economic development programs, any new fiscal obligation will be a burden. But $360 million would be near impossible.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost-sharing component will save the federal government a little under $100 billion.
“CBO expects that some states would maintain current benefits and eligibility and others would modify benefits or eligibility or possibly leave the program altogether because of the increased costs,” the analysis found.
Gov. Mike Braun’s administration didn’t provide a comment on the possible ramifications.
It’s important to remember the hungry Hoosiers at the heart of this debate. Despite the error rate — which includes underpayments as well as overpayments — most are desperate families in need of additional assistance to put food on the table.
USDA research from fiscal year 2023 showed Indiana is among the lowest states in the percent of population receiving SNAP – between 8 and 10%. In comparison, six states and Washington D.C. were above 16% and all of Indiana’s neighbors rank higher.
To be eligible, you must have a monthly net income of less than $1,255 for a family of one; $1,704 for a couple and $2,600 for a family of four. That means if you live alone and make over $300 a week you are ineligible for SNAP.
The amount you receive depends on your income but the average monthly payment per participant in April 2025 was $196. That is down slightly from April 2024.
Indiana’s enrollment went up during the pandemic when additional emergency aid was available. But generally, it has been stable and ranks about mid-pack nationally. For instance, in April 2025 281,112 households or 588,184 individuals. Those numbers are a few percentage points lower than April 2024 and slightly down from Fiscal Year 2023.
Other changes being considered nationally include imposing work requirements on those receiving benefits. And some states, like Indiana, will ban using the benefits on candy and pop. I generally don’t have a problem with those proposals.
But the cost-sharing provision will undoubtedly take food from hungry adults and children, and I hope the U.S. Senate re-evaluates the pain it could cause.

Joshua Syberg/Indiana National GuardFederal officials could be eying Indiana’s Camp Atterbury as a temporary holding site for immigrant detainees as nationwide deportation efforts continue — and detention demands grow.
While no official decision has been announced, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed to the Indiana Capital Chronicle on Thursday that the agency is actively “exploring all options” to meet current and future detention needs. 
The statement comes amid a push by President Donald Trump’s administration to stage the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people.
“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s enhanced enforcement operations and routine daily operations have resulted in a significant number of arrests of criminal aliens that require greater detention capacity in Indiana,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement. “While we cannot confirm individual pre-decisional conversations, we can confirm that ICE is exploring all options to meet its current and future detention requirements.”
So far, however, the Indiana National Guard “has no tasking or request” from federal authorities, a spokesperson told the Capital Chronicle.
The federally owned facility is licensed to and operated by the Indiana National Guard. It offers a variety of training ranges, live-fire venues, managed airspace with air-to-ground firing capabilities and an LVC simulation and exercise center.
Details still limited
For now, DHS officials have declined to provide a timeline or identify specific sites under consideration.
Camp Atterbury, located about 30 miles south of Indianapolis, has previously been used for large-scale federal operations. 
Most recently, in 2021, the facility temporarily housed thousands of Afghan refugees evacuated during the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan.

During Operation Allies Welcome, the base accommodated over 7,000 Afghan evacuees in 82 lodging buildings across six neighborhoods, complete with dining facilities and medical centers. The infrastructure includes dorm-style housing for families and open bay barracks for individuals, all equipped with heating, air conditioning and plumbing.
Camp Atterbury wouldn’t be the first military or state-owned site proposed to be repurposed by federal officials for immigration-related operations.
Most recently, Fort Bliss in Texas was identified as a potential deportation hub, with plans to hold thousands of detainees in massive tents on the Army base. The site could serve as the model for a dozen other holding facilities on military bases nationwide.
A lack of detention space could be a reason for ICE to tap Camp Atterbury and other locations.
The newest data released last week by DHS showed a drop in the number of immigrants in detention across the country for the first time since January — from 49,184 on May 4 to 48,870 on May 18 — but the shift could be due to existing detention facilities reaching capacity.
Congress allocated funds for 41,500 detention beds this year, almost 20% fewer than the current number of detainees.
Indiana ramps up enforcement
It’s unclear exactly how many people are currently being held in Indiana. Numbers can fluctuate daily as detainees are released or moved, so specific data is difficult to track.
Recent reporting by Mirror Indy revealed at least 400 ICE detainees being held at the Marion County Jail in Indianapolis. And the federal government is paying Marion County $75 per day for each person held.
As of March 17, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University reflected an average daily population of eight detainees at the Marion County Jail; and an average of 238 detainees at the Clay County Jail in Brazil, which is operated by the Clay County Sheriff’s Department and began housing ICE detainees in 2013 under contract with the federal government.

Using Camp Atterbury instead of local jails could save the federal government money.
There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank. A separate report released Thursday by the Center for Migration Studies found the nationwide population of people without permanent legal status to be closer to 12.2 million.
Indiana’s unauthorized immigrant population was estimated to be around 102,000 as of 2019.
During the 2025 legislative session, state lawmakers passed multiple measures to boost immigration enforcement and ensure local compliance with federal directives.
That included House Enrolled Act 1393, which requires local law enforcement to notify federal immigration authorities about undocumented immigrants in custody.
After sharp debate, a separate and stricter immigration proposal failed to pass, though. House Bill 1531 would have required local law enforcement officers to comply with federal detainer requests for undocumented immigrants. The bill would have also banned employers from hiring unauthorized residents. Though the bill passed out of the House on a 64-26 vote, it never got a hearing in the Senate.

The 2.75 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a small change in a state where temperatures can vary from below zero to around 100 degrees, but it is a very significant rise over the time period given historical temperature trends, said Jen Brady, a meteorologist at Climate Central. 
The post Average summer temps in Massachusetts have risen by 2.75 degrees Fa[...]","MASSACHUSETTS HAS SEEN a striking rise in summer temperatures over the past half-century, with statewide averages climbing by approximately 2.75 degrees Fahrenheit since 1970 and leading to more frequent and intense heat waves, heightened public health risks, and dangerous conditions for essential workers. The state has experienced a rise in temperatures that is comparable to the national average temperature rise of 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit, according to researchers at Climate Matters, a nonprofit group of climate scientists and communications experts.Suffolk County, which contains Boston, has experienced the steepest increase — warming by 3.3 degrees, outpacing the rest of the state and highlighting the amplifying effects of urban heat islands. Four other counties –Norfolk, Middlesex, Plymouth, and Worcester – had temperature rises above 3 degrees Fahrenheit. Climate Central’s analysis used monthly temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – the federal agency tasked with predicting and monitoring weather and climate – to find the average temperature change in March to May from 1970 to 2024.“Without human-caused climate change, the temperature would not have risen as much as it did,” said Jen Brady, a senior data analyst at Climate Central who leads investigations into climate trends and impacts. “[Global] temperatures will keep increasing, and already we’re locked into a certain amount of the increase because greenhouse gases – once they’re released into the atmosphere – don’t dissipate immediately.”The 2.75 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a small change in a state where temperatures can vary from below zero to around 100 degrees, but it is a very significant rise over the time period given historical temperature trends, said Brady.Warmer summers can lead to emergency room visits for heat-related illnesses increase during unprecedented heat waves. Children, adults with underlying health conditions, pregnant women, and outdoor workers are particularly impacted.Ian Sue Wing, an economist at Boston University who researches the health impacts of heat exposure, noted that Massachusetts has an aging population with almost a quarter of all residents who are 60 or older. “[Older] folks are extremely sensitive to heat because it turns out that, as you age, you are less able to effectively thermo-regulate,” said Wing.Cities are particularly likely to get hotter than the surrounding areas because there are fewer trees and green spaces that can bring the temperature down. They also have densely developed buildings, roads, concrete, and other heat sinks that absorb and release heat on hot days. That is one of the reasons why Suffolk County – which includes Boston, Chelsea, and Revere – might have warmed more than other parts of Massachusetts.“The entire city of Boston is a heat island,” said Zoe Davis, a climate resilience project manager for Boston. “But not everyone experiences a hot day in Boston in the same way. Some areas of Boston are hotter than the rest of the city, entering high-heat conditions sooner, reaching higher air temperatures, and remaining in heat wave conditions longer.”Ben Cares, Chelsea’s director of Housing and Community Development, said that residents of Chelsea – a city with a high proportion of immigrant and low-income residents – can be particularly vulnerable to extreme heat because many face language barriers which keep them from important information on how to protect themselves. Many are essential workers who can’t afford to not go to work even on dangerous heat days, and the city’s high levels of air pollution can make it harder to breathe with the heat. “As extreme heat increases, it’s not just that it’s uncomfortable; it’s becoming dangerous for our residents,” Cares said. “For low-income families, seniors, and communities of color, it isn’t just a weather issue. It’s an environmental justice crisis.”Essential workers who have to commute into work on hot days and those who work outdoors in jobs like construction or indoors in commercial kitchens or warehouses are also vulnerable. Workers can become dehydrated and overheated without proper hydration and well-timed breaks. There aren’t safety protocols around extreme heat in many workplaces across the state, according to Tatiana Begault, the head of the Massachusetts Coalition for Safety and Health, a group that focuses on protecting workers. Undocumented workers are the most vulnerable because they are unable to advocate for breaks or changes in work conditions without fear of retaliation, she said. Begault hopes that as temperatures warm, local and state governments will do more to protect essential workers from extreme heat. “Heat impairs concentration, memory, and decision making, which raises a lot of risk of workplace accidents, especially for those operating heavy machinery in construction areas,” said Begault. “[Essential workers] are part of a community and a population that is severely under monitored, under served, and under prepared.”The post Average summer temps in Massachusetts have risen by 2.75 degrees Fahrenheit in past 55 years, according to new data appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Emergency-room-CC.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 08:00:02.136625

How honest should elected officials be with the public?
It’s not a rhetorical question. In Kansas City, recent decisions by the mayor suggest a level of opacity that warrants closer scrutiny — not outrage, necessarily, but concern.
Mayor Quinton Lucas has sidestepped ethics rules, not by breaking them outright, but by rerouting gifts through a nonprofit shielded from disclosure. His lavish trips, funded by interests with business before the city, now appear routine.
The problem isn’t where he travels. It’s who pays, and what they stand to gain.
A series of reports by The Missouri Independent outlined a troubling pattern in the mayor’s conduct — one centered on secrecy, donor influence and potential retaliation against a whistleblower.
At issue: his ties to politically-connected contractors, campaign finance maneuvering and the use of a nonprofit to obscure gift-giving — all while pushing a publicly subsidized downtown stadium.
Kansas City mayor accused of skirting city gift ban by using nonprofit to pay for travel

At the center is the Mayors Corps of Progress for a Greater Kansas City Inc., a 501(c)(4) nonprofit with a vague mission. During Lucas’s first term, the organization covered more than $35,000 in travel, lodging, meals and tickets — including a $23,518 trip to the 2023 Super Bowl for Lucas, his then–chief of staff, and two police officers.
The day after the game, the Heavy Constructors Association (commonly called the Heavies), a major construction lobbying group, wired $24,000 to the nonprofit.
City ethics rules prohibit gifts over $1,000 to elected officials. Lucas claims these were work-related trips, yet he sought no city reimbursement and offered no public accounting. Instead, his team accepted dark-money donations from entities with business before the city, then kept the details quiet.
We only know of them because a whistleblower came forward. The pattern repeated in 2024 and 2025, when Lucas again hit the Super Bowl circuit — without a whistleblower to reveal who paid the bill.
In the following months, an anonymous investigation request was made to the Kansas City Municipal Ethics Commission, which just recently refused to engage, finding “no justification” warranting it.
Lucas, just back from a junket to Qatar, spoke about the issue with Kansas City radio host Pete Mundo.
“Big business exists around sports,” he told Mundo, “it is the reason that so many of us are spinning our wheels to see where the teams play.”
Lucas went on to say: “I will be in any room where I can share what is happening with Kansas City… with a bunch of rich people who have money to invest in Kansas City.”
The problem is not what room, or rather owner’s box, the mayor is in. Nor is the problem his rubbing elbows with wealthy people.
The problem isn’t money from afar; it’s money in the mayor’s back yard.
Lucas isn’t accepting gifts from people who want to invest in Kansas City; he (or rather his nonprofit, but that’s a distinction without much ethical difference here) is taking checks from businesses that want Kansas City to invest in them.
Specifically, the Royals, which donated $15,000 to the Mayors Corps in 2022, and the Heavies, with its $24,000 donation around the Super Bowl, benefit mightily from any taxpayer funding.
Lucas has presented himself as the man to make it happen — while refusing to disclose the terms of any deal.
It’s a huge potential conflict of interest that could be addressed with a little disclosure. Despite that, the mayor has doubled down on concealment, not transparency.
A cynic would say none of this is surprising, probably least of all to Lucas himself, who said: “I think the ethics commission got it right, I always knew they would.”
Kansas City mayor accused of retaliating against whistleblower who revealed nonprofit spending

The commission currently has five members, all appointed by Lucas.
To its credit, the commission recommended changes to the city’s code of ethics to clear up reporting requirements. But disregarding the complaint demonstrates the problem with dark money contributions. Because the Mayors Corps does not have any business before the city, the commission reasoned, there is no reporting requirement.
But the Mayors Corp got the money from people with business before the city. That starts to look like the nonprofit functions as a vehicle to launder donations — something that, again, could be addressed with a little disclosure and that, you’d think, the group would be eager to clear up.
Mark Funkhouser, Kansas City’s mayor from 2007 through 2011, said when he entered office that the Mayors Corp, “was explained to me as a slush fund that mayors had been using for many years to do just this sort of thing. Needless to say, I didn’t have any fat cats willing to set up and contribute to such a fund for me.”
Lucas does.
In the radio interview, Lucas argued that by getting donations to pay for his trips, he was being a good steward of the city’s finances. He called the idea that the city should cover his expenses, “preposterous.”
Taxpayers take note: If you’re not paying for what your elected officials are up to, then there’s a pretty good chance you’re the product, not the customer.
Advocating for taxpayer-funded development is one thing. Accepting undisclosed corporate gifts while doing so is another. It’s not just a bad look; it undermines the city’s ethics framework and public trust. The public deserves transparency, not evasive answers and twisted reasoning.
And they deserve a mayor who respects rules, and the spirit of them.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/426121962_707597881550725_3470030060976740617_n-1024x634.jpg,,,2025-05-30 06:59:02.474545

With a grocery store’s return to the former Sterling Market location looking increasingly doubtful, longtime resident Mike Mignone and his wife Haley Newman stepped in to fill the gap.

Photo by Gordon Miller/News & CitizenThis story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on May 29. For nearly two years, there was no way to consistently purchase fresh produce in Johnson. The newly opened Johnson General Store changed that.Since the Sterling Market closed following the flood of July 2023 and the grocer that operated it decided not to reopen the location, which had been repeatedly inundated over the years at its vulnerable position at the confluence of the Lamoille and Gihon rivers, the town had been without a grocery store.The restaurants, gas stations, the dollar store and the Foote Brook farm stand in the summer months have helped fill the void, but fresh vegetables could only be acquired during the long winter months by taking a trip to Morrisville, which is seven miles away if you live in the village and even farther if you live outside of it, and only an option for those who have a car to drive.With a grocery store’s return to the former Sterling Market location looking increasingly doubtful, longtime resident Mike Mignone and his wife Haley Newman stepped in to fill the gap by opening the Johnson General Store on Lower Main Street.During the noon hour last Friday, a steady flow of customers signaled that the store, which opened May 9, is already settling in as part of the community. From behind the register, Newman said monitoring what sells fast and soliciting feedback from customers is helping the store owners learn what works and what doesn’t.“We keep selling out of things that we didn’t necessarily expect would go so quickly,” Newman said. “There are certain things, like fresh produce, that we don’t want to order in large quantities and have them go bad, but then we’re selling them immediately and running out of different things.”Mignone, who previously ran Hangry Mike’s food truck and has a background in the restaurant industry, had planned to open something similar, but after participating in the Reimagine Johnson initiative organized by Vermont Council for Community Development, where increasing food access had emerged as a vital goal for the community in the wake of the 2023 flood, he and Newman decided to prioritize a general store instead.Supported by community members and the emerging food access task force, Mignone and Newman have put their own capital and equity on the line to open the store in the building they’re leasing from the former operators of the Get Yours head shop.They’ve taken out loans from both the town and the village revolving loan funds — which are meant to encourage just such a community-oriented operation — filling the gap with their own savings and ensuring all the requirements for the licenses they needed were met, all while managing a family that includes two elementary school-age kids and a fifteen-month-old.Mike Mignone, who opened the new Johnson General Store in May with his wife Haley Newman, has already been busy making prepared food options. Photo by Gordon Miller/News & CitizenIn February, a few months after Mignone announced his intent to open the general store, the Sterling Market property owners announced they would pursue a property buyout, ending speculation that a grocer might return to that location and making the need for the general store ever more urgent. Associated Grocers of New England, the former operator of the Sterling Market, is now the general store’s supplier.The response Newman and Mignone have gotten from the community so far has primarily been gratitude.“So much gratitude, so many smiles, so much excitement,” Newman said. “It’s really made all of the headaches and stresses of the past six months trying to get open worth it.”A variety of fruit, vegetables, pantry staples and dry goods line evenly spaced shelves in the closely kept but clean, well-lit space. There are plenty of locally and regionally produced goods, and Newman said there’s more on the way. Occasional empty space on the shelves marks where customers have been particularly enthusiastic, and Mignone has already rolled out some ready-made options in a warming case at the back of the store.At the community forums held as part of the Reimagine Johnson process, many remarked that it wasn’t the food they missed most about the Sterling Market, but its role as a place where shoppers ran into their neighbors.The Johnson General Store is cozier than the old grocery store, and options more limited, but neighbors are already showing up. It’s the first general store in Johnson since Facey’s General Store, which last advertised in the News & Citizen in 1976, though DJ’s Corner Store and Deli had served a similar role in the same location well into the 2000s before its deli case was swapped out for glass pipes.Johnson newcomer Joy Novakowski, who stopped by on Friday for a cup of coffee and a muffin to go, said food access had been important to her and her partner, and they had joined the food access task force when they came to town.As with the recent monumental move of the Johnson Public Library from its longtime, flood-prone home on Railroad Street to higher ground at Legion Field, Novakowski sees the general store as part of Johnson’s changing narrative.“It’s not only an essential hub, but socially, this is where we meet our neighbors,” she said. “With a community that’s trying to rebuild itself in so many ways and has the capacity to retain and grow, what does that story look like for Johnson when we’re actually nourishing the residents and people who are coming through to visit, too?”The Johnson General Store’s story is just beginning, but just getting its doors open has felt like a monumental accomplishment to Mignone.“We’ve got a long road ahead of us, but it’s been nice to be actually running the store,” he said.“We’re just relieved that we made it,” Newman said. “There were so many moments of like, ‘Are we ever going to open the doors?’ Because it was just roadblock after roadblock after roadblock, and then waiting on different permits and licenses, and then that final week, everything came together.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Johnson General Store gets warm welcome.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/johnson-general-store-1-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-05-30 06:59:02.474545

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)Republicans hoping to reclaim New Jersey’s governorship are largely united on how to make New Jersey more affordable.
They want to cut taxes.
Though virtually all five of the GOP candidates to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy support some form of tax cut — whether through rate changes or awards to offset locally set property taxes — they differ some on the details. The primary is June 10.
 Bramnick

State Sen. Jon Bramnick lauded a longstanding Republican proposal to adjust New Jersey’s income tax brackets for inflation to combat a phenomenon called bracket creep.
GOP legislators have argued that because the state’s income tax brackets are not indexed for inflation, residents’ tax rates increase over time with their incomes, cutting into any gains in purchasing power.
Bramnick also suggested simplifying New Jersey’s tax brackets, though he did not detail those proposed changes. He said the combined changes would produce $1,600 in annual savings for joint filers, or $1,000 for single filers.
He also proposed requiring school districts to return excess state aid to their property taxpayers, saying it would lower average residents’ property tax bills by $800. State school aid, pegged for just over $12 billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1, is funded with income tax revenue.
 Ciattarelli

Former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli likewise said he would condense New Jersey’s income tax brackets, adding he would “reduce income taxes for all taxpayers” and introduce exemptions and deductions for home improvements and student loan interest. His platform provides no specifics about either plan.
Ciattarelli, who sought the governor’s seat unsuccessfully in 2017 and 2021, pledged to reduce New Jersey’s corporate business tax rates by five points over as many years. Currently, New Jersey taxes its businesses on non-marginal rates ranging between 6.5% and 9%, depending on net income.
Businesses with more than $10 million in income face an additional 2.5% non-marginal surcharge for what’s called the corporate transit fee (which is intended to fund NJ Transit). Counting the surcharge, New Jersey has the highest state business tax rates in the nation. Without it, the Garden State’s rates are the nation’s fourth highest.
Ciattarelli said he would cap property tax rates to a percentage of a home’s valuation. Statewide, locally set property tax rates in 2024 averaged just over 2.6%, according to Department of Community Affairs data.
Ciattarelli also seeks to reduce state spending by 30%, though it’s not clear what programs he would slash to produce more than $17.4 billion in savings. Gov. Phil Murphy’s budget plan for the next fiscal year calls for about $58.4 billion in spending.
 Spadea

Longtime radio talk show host Bill Spadea’s affordability plan offers few details.
It proposes unspecified cuts to individual and business taxes and cites the large growth in spending under Murphy. Gov. Chris Christie’s final budget called for $35.5 billion in spending for the 2018 fiscal year, 40% smaller than the final budget proposal of Murphy’s second term.
Much of those increases can be attributed to full funding of pension payments and school aid, which together rose by $7.6 billion between Christie’s and Murphy’s final budget proposals.
The roughly 31% in inflation between the two budgets accounts for much of the remainder, though some budget items are not directly tied to rising prices.
 Kranjac

Former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac’s tax plan focuses mainly on property taxes. He said he would seek to cut property taxes, which are locally set, by 2% in each year of his term. The average property New Jersey tax bill was $10,095 in 2024, according to Department of Community Affairs data.
He also said he would seek to cut regulations and business taxes to encourage small business growth but did not provide specifics about either proposal.
 Barbera

Burlington County contractor Justin Barbera has said he would seek to lower taxes for New Jerseyans without children and lower or remove them for seniors, veterans, and those with disabilities.
The details of those proposals are unclear.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)New Jersey lawmakers are considering changes to the state’s special election rules after two sitting members of New Jersey’s House delegation died in office last year, deaths that led each of those seats to remain vacant for five months.
The legislation, which would shorten timelines for special elections to fill House vacancies, comes as another New Jersey member of Congress could step down by next January. Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill are among six Democrats competing in June 10’s gubernatorial primary, and if either is victorious in the primary and then in November, they would have to vacate their House seat.
Bill sponsor Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex) said the state’s current rules on filling House vacancies need to be changed.
“I thought it was pretty important that we get rid of this so that the people of New Jersey have representation, and if they don’t have it, make sure that gets filled as quickly as possible,” he told the New Jersey Monitor.
He added: “We’ve got two members of Congress … running for governor, so there’s a reasonable likelihood there will be another vacancy starting in January, whenever the transition occurs.”
Sherrill’s and Gottheimer’s Democratic rivals have criticized both of them for putting their seats in jeopardy of being vacant if they win the primary. Republicans have just a two-seat majority in the House.
The Senate’s state government committee on Thursday briefly discussed the New Jersey bill, but it did not vote on it.
Though New Jersey law and the U.S. Constitution allow New Jersey governors to make interim appointments to fill empty Senate seats — as when Gov. Phil Murphy appointed his former chief of staff George Helmy to fill a Senate vacancy after Bob Menendez resigned — the Constitution requires House vacancies to be filled by elections, if they are filled at all.
Presently, New Jersey has three separate structures for filling House vacancies, and timing determines which is used.
If a seat becomes empty at least 70 days before a June primary for any office, the governor is required to order them filled at the next general election, with nominees decided during that primary.
If the seat becomes vacant within the 70 days preceding a primary but more than 70 days from the general election in an odd-numbered year, the governor may — but is not required to — call for the seat to be filled at the state’s next general election. In such cases, a district’s county committee members choose their party’s nominee.
State law also allows the governor to call for special elections — with both primaries and generals — to fill House vacancies. Gov. Phil Murphy called for a special election last year after Rep. Donald Payne Jr.’s April death. Then-Newark City Council President LaMonica McIver won the special primary in July to be the Democratic Party’s nominee and won the special election in September to serve the remainder of Payne’s term (she won election to a full term in November).
Murphy did not call for an election in August when Rep. Bill Pascrell died. Democratic officials picked then-state Sen. Nellie Pou (D-Passaic) to replace him on the November ballot, and she was elected to a full term.
Under current law, when the governor is required to call for a special election, there is no required timeline for them to do so.
“They can keep that seat vacant until the next general election, and they frankly might do that for politics if there’s a razor-thin margin and it’s a Democratic seat, or vice-versa,” bill sponsor state Sen. John McKeon (D-Essex) said Thursday.
The bill would require the governor to call for a special election within 10 days of a seat becoming vacant unless there are fewer than 100 days remaining in the unexpired term.
First introduced following Payne’s death, the bill would require special elections — including primaries — to be held between 74 and 80 days after a seat becomes vacant when there are more than 180 days left before the end of the current Congress.
Vacancies incurred with between 100 and 180 days left in the term would be filled by special elections held between 80 and 86 days after the seat becomes vacant. In that case, there would be no special primary, and district county committee members would select parties’ nominees.
If a House seat becomes vacant within 100 days of the end of the congressional term, it would be filled at the next regular election. County committees would select replacements for candidates who die after they’ve been placed on the ballot, as they do under current law.
That timeline especially is condensed by the bill. Under current law, House vacancy races with special primaries can sit empty for more than five months.
“This is now practical as opposed to theoretical. We went through it with the death of Congressman Payne and then the death of Congressman Pascrell,” McKeon said. “We figured out what a nuisance it is, quite frankly, and a nightmare to fill those congressional seats.”
Zwicker said he hoped to have the bill passed before the end of Murphy’s term in early January.
Fears about another vacancy redoubled after Rep. Donald Norcross (D-01) was hospitalized for an infection that turned septic in early April. Norcross was discharged from the hospital after roughly a month following the life-threatening episode.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Following the release of a video showing a North Carolina state trooper and his supervisor agreeing to lie about the police chase that led to the death of Tyrone Mason, attorneys for the family demanded they be fired for their actions.
Renowned civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Bakari Sellers also condemned Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman Thursday after a report from her office indicated she would not seek criminal charges against the troopers despite footage showing State Trooper Garrett Macario denying that he pursued Mason — a false account that was relayed to Mason’s mother.
Crump and Sellers had been pushing for the release of the footage surrounding Mason’s fatal crash in the early morning hours of Oct. 7, 2024 for months. A Wake County Superior Court judge ordered it to be made public on May 16 following a lawsuit that included several newsrooms seeking the videos.
“Now you got the video evidence in your hand, and you refuse to file charges against the killer cops,” Crump told members of the media outside the Wake County Courthouse. “She’s slapping us in our face because she says, ‘I don’t care what evidence you have, it doesn’t matter, I’m still going to take the cop’s word over whatever evidence you have.’”
In an interview Thursday afternoon, Freeman pushed back on these assertions and said Mason’s family and their attorneys are welcome to review the full investigative findings. Though her office declined to prosecute, her office dropped more than 180 cases that would have relied on testimony from the state troopers.
“One of the reasons I opened up this investigation to begin with is that I believe that Mrs. Mason, who had been given the runaround for months, deserved to have the answers of what happened to her son that night,” Freeman said.
A piece of common ground between the Mason family attorneys and Freeman: a belief that the highway patrolmen involved should lose their jobs for misconduct. “I do not believe that these officers should be in law enforcement,” she said.
Henrietta Mason, the mother of Tyrone Mason, brought a civil rights lawsuit against Macario on May 21, citing the false claims about the crash and a failure to render timely aid, which attorneys for the family believe could have saved his life.
“Miss Freeman, you told me to my face you was on my side. You told me you was on my side. But no, you’re on the side of the state troopers, the men that lied,” she said at the press conference. “If they did this to my baby, how many other babies have they did this to?”
‘A bad chase’
In footage released by the State Highway Patrol and Raleigh Police Department, Macario and his supervisor, Sgt. Matthew Morrison, can be heard creating the false account of events, which Macario then relays to Raleigh police.
The footage, which includes both dash camera video from the trooper’s cruiser and body camera video after arriving on the scene, shows Macario pursuing Mason until he crashes into a concrete barrier, around which point Macario appears to turn off his emergency lights and return to the scene from the other direction. Macario said on the call that he “did not feel it was a safe chase.”
“I wouldn’t mention anything to them about you trying to stop him,” Morrison can be heard saying on the call with Macario. “Just say, ‘Hey, man, I drove up on this,’ and leave it at that.”
Five minutes after the call with his supervisor, Macario can be seen on the RPD footage relaying that version of the narrative to officers who subsequently arrived on the scene.

“Were you like pulling him over or something?” Raleigh police officer R. Urena asks in the footage.
“No, this is a little area I work,” Macario answers. “I came up on him and I saw the smoke and heard all the cars hitting the debris.”
That account was then given by Raleigh Police to Henrietta Mason when they informed her of her son’s death — a lie that only unraveled when a witness came forward to tell her he heard the police pursuit, including the deactivation of the trooper’s siren at roughly the same time as the crash.
“You got a video of the officer lying through his teeth,” Crump said. “Not only is he lying, but he’s conspiring — they are conspiring to cover up the crime. They conspire and say, you know, ‘I was chasing him,’ his supervisor says, ‘Well, you don’t want to admit that.’”
Sellers, the lead attorney for the family, said he was also disturbed by Macario’s failure to attempt to render aid to Tyrone Mason. Though Macario witnesses the crash and calls his supervisor immediately afterward, no one checks on Mason’s status until six minutes after it occurs, when Urena and another officer knock on the window and open the driver’s side door.
“We’re not just talking about the lie. We’re not just talking about the obstruction,” Sellers said. “We’re talking about a bad chase and bad policies and bad procedures. We’re talking about a refusal to render aid. We’re talking about the fact that this county lied to this woman month after month after month after month.”
‘The evidence would not support a successful prosecution’
In her report declining to prosecute the troopers, however, district attorney Freeman — who announced earlier this month that she would not seek reelection in 2026 — wrote that while “inexcusable,” Macario and Morrison’s actions do not rise to the level of criminal conduct.
“While their dishonesty violates the standards to which law enforcement officers must adhere, the District Attorney is not pursuing criminal charges as the evidence would not support a successful prosecution,” she wrote. “The District Attorney has shared her concerns about their conduct with the North Carolina State Highway Patrol who has the authority to decide whether they will remain employed.”

According to Freeman’s report, released May 21, Macario subsequently gave a truthful account of the chase to two other members of the Raleigh Police, who confirmed he did so when interviewed. Though there is video footage of Macario speaking with one of the officers who said he told the truth, no audio of that conversation exists. But this account never made it to Henrietta Mason, as the investigator in the case only received the earlier statement.
“[Macario’s] subsequent truthful statements within the relevant time frame prevent the State from being able to move forward with a successful prosecution,” Freeman wrote. “Moreover, evidence would tend to suggest that Sergeant Morrison’s and Trooper Macario’s intent in initially not disclosing the effort to stop Mr. Mason was to keep them from having to manage the crash scene and do the crash reconstruction investigation.”
That conclusion, she said, is evidenced by Morrison’s remark on the video that “it sounds like Raleigh’s problem.”
Henrietta Mason and her attorneys were not satisfied with this outcome, and supporters of the family made Freeman one of the primary targets of their ire at the press conference Thursday. “Lorrin Freeman, Tyrone’s blood is on your hands too!” one demonstrator’s sign read.
“Let me get this straight: You’re going to take the word of a liar, the person you knew just lied, you don’t got no evidence of what he’s saying now, but you’re going to take his word?” Crump asked. “I don’t ever profess to be the smartest guy in the room, but that logic just ain’t logical.”
Freeman said in an interview that while initially, “we were skeptical ourselves” when members of the Raleigh Police came forward to attest that Macario gave them an accurate version of events, there was sufficient evidence to support it, including notes from the night of the crash by a Wake County forensic investigator. In those notes, the investigator records the officer who came forward informing her that a trooper attempted to stop Tyrone Mason prior to the crash.
“We went to great lengths — and that was part of what took so much time in this investigation — to try to nail that down,” Freeman said. “Part of that was finding through the course of that information that shows that Trooper Macario basically tells different stories to different people on the scene.”
‘Justice for Tyrone Mason’
Despite the lack of a criminal prosecution, Sellers and Crump vowed to continue pursuing justice for Tyrone Mason and his family through the courts, primarily through the ongoing lawsuit against Macario.
Sellers said the revelation of “how grossly negligent the Raleigh Police Department has been” means that they may pursue legal action against them as well. He told members of the media Thursday that they will be filing a notice of claim against RPD, which is a prerequisite for seeking damages.
The Raleigh Police Department did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Sellers said Raleigh Police Chief Rico Boyce offered to meet with Henrietta Mason, but she and her attorneys declined in light of the meeting with the district attorney.
In her report, Freeman wrote that she relayed concerns over handling of the incident to both the State Highway Patrol and the Raleigh Police Department, and is also providing the findings to the North Carolina Criminal Justice Training and Standards Division, the body that certifies members of law enforcement.
The State Highway Patrol is also still pursuing an internal review of the crash and aftermath, and Macario and Morrison remain on administrative leave, according to Department of Public Safety spokesperson Christopher Knox, who called Mason’s death a “heartbreaking occurrence.”
“We do recognize and take ownership that words spoken and captured by video in the moments after the collision’s occurrence do not reflect the high standards we place upon our members nor the lifesaving work that we see them carry out daily,” Knox wrote. “We do believe, however, that this collision was a result of Mr. Mason’s actions alone and that is reflected in the unbiased collision report completed by the Raleigh Police Department.”

Rev. Gregory Drumwright, an activist with Justice 4 the Next Generation who prayed over the press conference, said in his view, this case has “redefined what the purpose of police wearing body-worn cameras is.”
“Somebody tell me, if we are not going to use as evidence the truth, transparency, and undisputable facts that audio and video presents, then what is the purpose of body-worn cameras in the first place?” Drumwright asked. “Why did they have the cameras on if they can lie thinking the cameras is off and still get away with their lies?”
Also speaking in support of the family’s efforts was state Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham), who said she plans to use her position to push for greater oversight and probe more deeply into the circumstances of the case.
“We have a right to make a justice system that was not built for us to see us, hear us, and hold it accountable,” Murdock said. “We will continue to ensure that Tyrone Mason gets the justice that he deserves. His life mattered and had value, and we will continue to lift up his name.”
In addition to law enforcement, Sellers expressed disappointment in top elected officials for not putting their weight behind the case. Calling Governor Josh Stein and Attorney General Jeff Jackson “two very good friends” of his, he lamented that neither had spoken out about Tyrone Mason’s death. “Their silence is not just deafening, but their silence is acquiescence,” he said.
Spokespeople for Jackson and Stein did not respond to requests for comment.
Crump said all Henrietta Mason is seeking is “simple justice,” something that should not require such extreme lengths to receive.
“We always believed that if we had it on video where they could see it and hear it, that Black people would have a chance at equal justice,” Crump said. “Don’t say no more, look at the video — and that’s our case.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5291996-scaled-e1748565446154-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 06:59:02.474545

LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) argues Thursday in the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee for including the full budget request from the state Department of Safety and Professional Services in the 2025-27 Wisconsin state budget. (Screenshot/WisEye)Republicans on the Legislature’s budget committee rejected a proposal Thursday to add permanent staff to the state agency responsible for ensuring that a range of professionals have licenses they need to do their jobs.
Instead, the Joint Finance Committee voted along party lines to extend five contract positions for three more years as well as add a handful of other positions.
The 2025-27 state budget marks the fourth one in which Gov. Tony Evers has been rebuffed after urging lawmakers to increase staffing at the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) to speed up the agency’s license and permit administration.
There was no debate during the 45-minute meeting Thursday.
All four Democrats on the committee spoke up, either to advocate for their proposal for the agency or to criticize the GOP proposal as inadequate. None of the Republicans, however, made arguments for their plan for DSPS or against the Democrats’ alternative.
In addition to issuing professional licenses in health care, personal services, professions such as accounting or architecture and for skilled tradespeople such as plumbers and electricians, DSPS also oversees a variety of building and other public safety licenses and permits.
Starting more than three years ago, Republican lawmakers raised criticism of the agency amid heavy backlogs in the licensing process for a wide range of professionals.  
Democratic lawmakers — as well as some outside groups representing licensed professionals — have charged the backlog was a result of the Legislature’s failure to authorize more positions at the department.
The department is almost entirely self-funded through the fees it collects from license applications, but the size of its staff requires the approval of the Legislature.  
In the 2023-25 draft state budget, Evers requested 74 new positions at DSPS, but the final spending plan drafted largely by the Republican majority on the finance committee added 17.75 positions.
Evers redirected pandemic relief funds to DSPS to hire more contract workers to help manage the licensing process. In the last couple of years, the backlog has been reduced so that on average a license is issued in two weeks, according to state Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay), a finance committee member.
In his 2025-27 budget draft, Evers requested 30 new positions at the agency. On Thursday, Democrats on the finance committee proposed adding 31 positions, including 14 to staff the department’s call center serving license applicants and nine additional employees to process license applications.
Authorizing fewer people than DSPS has requested “has a tremendous risk of causing significant delays or or even just making it a little bit harder for people to be able to get their license,” said Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha). “We want people to be able to get the licenses that they need so they can go to work. We want people to get the renewals that they need so they can continue working.”
State law requires about 10% of the fee revenue from professional licenses in health and business professions to be transferred to the state budget’s general fund.
“We have been pulling funds out of an agency that’s almost basically self-sufficient and dumping the money into the general fund, all while the demand for licenses is exploding,” said Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee).
Johnson warned the committee that if the licensing process gets bogged down again, shortages in fields such as health care in particular are likely to worsen.
Falling short of funding the department’s full request “impacts every single person in the state, whether you’re a licensee or not,” said Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison). “What we are doing is starving that system and making it harder for every single one of us to access needed professional services.”
The Democratic proposal failed on a 4-12 vote, with all the Republicans on the 16-member committee voting against it. 
The Republican measure passed 12-4, with only Republicans’ support.
It extends five contract call center positions that expire Sept. 30 for another three years.
The GOP motion omits three lawyers and three paralegals the department had requested for professional regulation compliance and for the state’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.
The motion also transfers $5 million from DSPS revenues to the state budget’s general fund, in addition to the annual 10% from license fees. 
The Republican measure authorizes a consultant for pharmacy inspections that was part of the original budget draft. It also includes funding to continue a youth firefighter training grant that was in the original request and the Democratic proposal.
The committee’s co-chairs, Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam), released a joint statement later Thursday declaring that “Joint Finance Republicans voted to invest in important government services while holding the line on spending.”
The statement cited funding for DSPS call center staff “to help credential holders and the public navigate licensure platforms” and said the funding “ensures the department can operate effectively and provide these critical services to professionals.”
Immediately after the final vote, however, Andraca told her colleagues that the outcome was a missed opportunity.
“We could be sitting here claiming a bipartisan success story, because today the median time to get a license is only 15 days,” Andraca said. “We should be continuing the success story and taking a victory lap, and instead we’re chipping away the progress that we’ve made — and that’s very disappointing.”

Brad Little’s office and the Idaho State Tax Commission have not accepted the league’s invitation to work together on a public awareness campaign highlighting a new state education tax credit Little signed into law this year.

Co-President Jean Henscheid said members of the league tried working for weeks with the Idaho State Tax Commission and Little’s office to create a public awareness campaign around the new Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit.

The law has been effective for nearly six months. Henscheid said members of the league felt it was important to try to facilitate a discussion or public forum on how families can participate in the tax credit and how accountability will work.
“Over the course of the 80 years we have been active in Idaho we have provided dozens, if not hundreds, of opportunities for public education events including candidate forums, roundtable discussions, community events asking people what they think of particular polices and providing them with the kind of information they need to be informed voters,” Henscheid said.
“Even in its embryonic state, there is enough interest in this $50 million initiative that we felt it would be a service to the public to offer and to facilitate it, which is what the league has done for 80 years,” Henscheid said.

  State still working out details on tax credit program that would allow public dollars for private schooling 

Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the Idaho State Tax Commission said the state does not yet have answers to many of the questions the League of Women Voters of Idaho gathered for a public awareness campaign. 
“We’re still working out the details of the Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit program,” Idaho State Tax Commission public information officer Renee Eymann said Wednesday. “This is a complex piece of legislation, and we want to have the correct information available.”
The law creating the tax credit has already taken effect. House Bill 93 was written so that it took effect retroactively on Jan. 1, 2025. 
The new credit in House Bill 93 provides up to a $5,000 refundable tax credit for qualifying education expenses, including tuition at a private, religious school. Under the law, parents, guardians or foster parents can receive the credit for qualified expenses such as private school tuition and fees.
Eymann said officials with the Idaho State Tax Commission are still:

Reviewing the definitions as they relate to taxes
Looking at the reporting requirements so the commission can roll them into the application process
Determining the commission’s administrative duties and how they’ll align with the law’s requirements

Henscheid said the league was open to all sorts of ideas for a public forum or public awareness campaign – including a town hall event, a webinar, a literature campaign or a Q&A of some format.
“If they thought meeting on aisle 12 at Walmart and talking to people about it would help, we would have done it, Henscheid said. 
 Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed new tax credit into law 

During his Jan. 6 State of the State address Little said: “I recognize the growing desire to expand school choice, especially for students with unique physical or developmental conditions.”
Little then recommended spending $50 million “to further expand education options for Idaho families,” and he signed House Bill 93 into law on Feb. 27.

For this article, Little’s office referred questions about the Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit and the League of Women Voters of Idaho’s outreach efforts to the Idaho State Tax Commission.
Parents will be able to apply for the new Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit on Jan. 15, 2026, Eymann said. 
Once the Idaho State Tax Commission has the details and requirements of the new law sorted out, officials will seek to share those details with the public, the commission said.
“As we finalize more information, we’ll be sharing it with all groups that are willing to help us spread the word,” Eymann said. “This will include issuing news releases, compiling frequently asked questions, providing steps on how to fill out the application for the credit, and explaining what 300% below poverty level means.”

 



 A list of some of the questions the League of Women Voters of Idaho gathered from the public this spring 

Financial Information

How do tax credits work in general? Are there examples similar to the Parental Choice Tax Credit Program?
Will the same system used for determining qualified expenses through the Empowering Parents grants be used for the Parental Choice Tax Credit Program? Who will be responsible for determining the eligibility of individual family expenses (e.g. qualified instructional materials or travel)? Will the Empowering Parents grants program process be combined with this process? Will levels of compliance and noncompliance be reported publicly (see also accountability Question #23 below)
Can families who do not file taxes apply?
Could you clarify the following: Parents seeking an advanced payment may also receive a tax credit in the same year. Is that correct? Does that mean one student could receive as much as $10,000 or $15,000 during the first year of eligibility?
Is there a limit to the number of children per household who may be eligible for the tax credit?
Will a student who registers for an enrichment program, after school activity, or music lesson through a public school, public charter school, public virtual charter school, public magnet school, or part-time public kindergarten while they are using the tax credit forfeit the entire credit for that term? How will this impact future applications? Who will be tasked with tracking ineligible enrollment and recovering the tax credit?
Will a nonpublic school that disenrolls a student during an academic term in which a tax credit is being used retain the tax credit funds? If not, will the remaining funds be returned to the state or to parents? Who will be tasked with tracking this?
Will a closing nonpublic school receiving tax credit funds retain those funds or return the remainder to the parents? Do closing nonpublic schools have any obligations to enrolled students using the tax credit funds?

Application Process

What information will be required on the application form?
How was the 60-day application window determined? Is this like other programs?
Will parents whose modified adjusted gross income does not exceed 300% of the federal poverty level have an early window during the 60 days to apply? If not, how will the preference process work?
The law says parents who are reapplying will be given preference over parents who qualify under the federal poverty level criteria. This seems to shift the program’s priorities from the first year. Is this correct?
Will parents have someone to help them through the application process?

Student Learning

The law states that tax credits may be used to cover academic instruction in English language arts, mathematics, science, and social science. Who will be tasked with verifying (and reverifying) that these subjects are taught? Will it be a self-report by the school?
Who will be tasked with defining a portfolio of evidence or learning record that indicates the student’s growth? Will this be up to each school? Will portfolios and learning records be housed at the Tax Commission? If so, will they be secured? Does the student retain ownership of the intellectual property in these documents? Who will conduct the audit of these records to establish that the instruction meets the requirements listed in Question 14 above? What does “sufficient” evidence for an audit mean?

Accountability

Could you tell us more about what is meant by an “accredited” school?
How will parents reapplying for the program certify that they have completed the mandatory satisfaction and engagement survey? What evidence will be required?
Will someone be tasked with ensuring that students with disabilities are receiving services under 20 U.S.C. 1412 of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act?
Will parents of students with disabilities have an advocate who will help students get the help they need?
What remedy will be applied if the Tax Commission determines that services mandated by federal law are not provided by the nonpublic school to students with disabilities?
The law states that its provisions shall not be construed to permit any government agency to exercise control or supervision over any nonpublic school student and nonpublic schools shall not be required to alter their creeds, practices, admissions policies, or curriculum in order to accept students using parental choice tax credits. Are remedies through the state available to parents if schools fail to comply with the disabilities education act or are identified through the satisfaction and engagement survey as failing in their duty to students?
Do the Legislature, Governor’s Office, or Tax Commission constitute government entities not permitted to control or supervise nonpublic school students or impact creeds, practices, admissions policies, or curriculum of nonpublic schools? If not, why is this the case?
Which state employee or employees will be responsible for developing the mandatory satisfaction and engagement survey? Will results be available to participating parents, nonpublic schools, or other stakeholder groups outside the Tax Commission, the governor, and relevant legislative leadership and committees? Will results be made available to the public as state-generated documents? Will results be analyzed? If yes, by whom and for what purpose? Will results be used to improve the program, the nonpublic schools, or student learning? Will results of the annual program report to the governor and relevant legislative leadership and committees be made public and/or used to inform program improvement?

Another agency, which previously occupied the now-vacant work areas within view of the door, relocated years ago. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Tippecanoe County resident Pamela Frazee just wants to know if her messages went through.
Phone calls to Indiana’s Office of the Public Access Counselor (PAC) route directly to a voicemail box and aren’t returned. Emails — including allegations of public access law violations that the office weighs in on — go unacknowledged. No opinions from this year are online.
Frustrated Hoosiers report the office has gone mum after a leadership shake-up.
“It’s not been a good transition at all if you don’t even have people who can answer the phones,” said Frazee, who sought confirmation that her time-sensitive complaints were received.
Former PAC Luke Britt, who ran the office for about 12 years under previous Govs. Mike Pence and Eric Holcomb, announced plans to resign mid-February, WFYI reported. In late March, new Gov. Mike Braun named Indianapolis attorney Jennifer Ruby as the successor. The office has one other employee, Kyra Helming, listed in the state’s transparency portal.
Britt, the state’s longest-serving PAC, pointed to an “overwhelming” workload in a niche area of law.

“I don’t envy what she’s having to deal with right now at all,” he said. “It’s not my place to give her the benefit of the doubt. But I certainly do.”
Braun’s administration, meanwhile, pinned blame on him.
“When Gov. Braun’s public access counselor appointment began in March, she inherited dozens of cases from 2024 that were not finalized,” Governor’s Office spokesman Griffin Reid said. “With that backlog successfully addressed, she is focusing her efforts on the 2025 cases and the statutory responsibilities of the office. Gov. Braun is fully committed to transparency at all levels.”
The Capital Chronicle requested comment from Ruby’s office May 9 and in the past week, but didn’t receive a response from her. No one answered the door when reporters showed up.
The PAC provides guidance on state public records and open meeting laws. The officeholder responds to informal inquiries on the laws, issues non-binding advisory opinions and educates officials and Hoosiers on their rights and responsibilities, according to the website.
The Indiana General Assembly created the office in 1999.
Keeping up
For Frazee, who filed two formal complaints mid-May and hasn’t heard back, the “PAC clock is ticking.”
Formal complaints must be filed with the office within 30 days of either an agency’s denial of records access or notice of an improperly held meeting. A complaint is considered filed on the date it is received, according to the office’s public access law handbook. Once a complaint is accepted, the PAC notifies the alleged offending agency and gives it 20 business days to respond.
“Do I need to resend it? Did you assign it? Did you toss it?” Frazee worried.
She said a confirmation that a filing has been received — “always” sent during Britt’s tenure — would provide reassurance “that I have submitted the PAC complaint in a timely fashion, where I don’t have to worry about it being tossed.”
Keeping up with demand proved a challenge, per Britt.
The workload grew annually, “sometimes by an exponential amount.” And “volume-wise, it was even overwhelming for me at times, just trying to keep it all straight, be responsive,” he recalled.
He said “constituent relations” — responding to Hoosier queries — was his top priority and became his workday.
An influx of 50-100 calls and emails were coming in daily by the time he left, Britt estimated. He described a “benchmark” for getting messages answered within 24 business hours.
Hoosier lawmakers decline to remove public records chief restrictions

“If I had time, or I would take work home in the evenings, to actually write opinions,” he continued. Legislation that went into effect last July “de-emphasized opinions even more, so I would try to resolve those conflicts informally as much as I could.”
House Enrolled Act 1338 limited the PAC to using only the law’s “plain text” — despite statutory ambiguities — and official court orders in writing opinions. Also, the governor can now remove a PAC at any time, instead of “for cause.”
He still wrote opinions, though — and imposed a benchmark for them, too.
The goal was to have all of of the the previous year’s opinions done before the first quarter of the next year ended. By the time he left, Britt said, he’d distributed the 2024 opinions but hadn’t uploaded them online; he hadn’t started on the 2025 complaints.
His longtime deputy or an administrative assistant would usually handle tasks like uploading opinions. (Only about half those written are uploaded, according to a formal complaint guide.) But both staffers left partway through 2024, as the term-limited Holcomb administration neared its end. Britt said that’s when the office fell behind on uploads.
He ran the agency solo for nearly a year. Then he resigned.
“I was worried when I left that there would be a lot of loose ends,” Britt said. “There was a lot of work in progress. There always was. No matter when I left, I knew … I couldn’t even begin to wrap everything up with a bow. I did what I could and tried to leave behind as many breadcrumbs as I could, but there was just too much.”
He estimated leaving behind 11 pending complaints and recalled Ruby mentioning the backlog had grown to about 40.

(Photo by Trawick Images/Getty Images)The oil and gas industry is a major economic engine in Oklahoma, contributing significantly to jobs and tax revenue. But, we are paying for this lucrative driver of our economy with environmental degradation and harm to community health.
And unfortunately our state and federal leaders have continued to have little interest in passing regulations governing the industry that would protect public health despite first being alerted to risks over four decades ago.
Leaders first became aware of the threat to public health in 1982 when the American Petroleum Institute’s Committee for Environmental Biology and Community Health issued a report  that highlighted the fact that materials of interest to the oil and gas industry “contain measurable quantities of radionuclides” in equipment, product streams or waste.
Every stage of production can produce what is known as “technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material,” or TENORM.
During oil and gas drilling, radioactive elements are carried to the surface. And radioactive elements are often present in the massive volumes of wastewater produced by a working oil or gas well.
Currently, there are no dedicated federal regulations to ensure comprehensive and safe management of radioactive oil and gas materials. The industry was granted a federal exemption in 1980 that legally defined its waste as nonhazardous, despite containing toxic chemicals, carcinogens, heavy metals, and radioactivity.
This leaves Oklahomans reliant on state regulations and oversight, which unfortunately, are spotty at best.
Oklahoma has no general radiation provisions and therefore does not regulate TENORM waste. This lack of regulation means there are no specific rules in place to control the disposal or handling of this waste, potentially leading to exposure risks for workers and residents.
If this TENORM is not adequately managed and disposed of, it poses significant health threats to oil and gas workers, their families and nearby residents. That health risk includes the increased risk of cancer. Through mismanagement, waste can leak out of storage pits, tanks, and landfills or spill during transportation. It is sometimes purposely spread over land and mixed with the soil in an industrial waste management practice known as “land farming.” Wastewater may be used for dust suppression or deicing roads.
A 2021 paper published in the journal “Energy Economics” examined two decades of data from 76 Oklahoma counties.
The authors found that an increase in the number of fracked wells led to a statistically significant reduction in life expectancy. They also noted increases in those county’s mortality and rates of cancer, cardiac diseases, and respiratory diseases.
The industry is trying to pivot now toward the treatment of oilfield waste, but the problem is that if you remove the radioactive heavy metals that are already at elevated levels, you just concentrate them.
There are also very limited ways to dispose of the wastewater, and the chief method is injection wells, which account for 96% of disposal.
Oklahoma has over 10,600 such wells. Unfortunately, injection wells pose their own set of problems. The U.S. Geological Survey has linked them to earthquakes. In Oklahoma, earthquakes have increased 900-fold since 2008, when fracking became more prevalent.
Some of these wells are also now leaking their waste back to the surface across America. If deep formations fail to contain the toxic waste injected into them, that waste can migrate and end up in shallow freshwater aquifers.
Despite the potential environmental and health threats few municipalities have strong ordinances to protect residents from these sites and an injection site may be permitted with little to no community knowledge or involvement.
Is it any wonder that Oklahoma has such poor health outcomes, including the fourth highest cancer death rate in the country?
If lawmakers really want to improve Oklahoma’s lagging health outcomes, perhaps new laws governing the oil and gas industry’s disposal processes would be a place to start.

Job Corps, Head Start and Trio among programs targeted for cuts that would have major implications for reservation communities, tribal representatives and others told lawmakers. “It’s very scary,” a superintendent said.
The post Threatened federal funding for education, workforce programs spark concern among Wyoming tribes appeared first on WyoFile .","A national narrative that Job Corps isn’t working couldn’t be further from the truth in central Wyoming, according to Jared Baldes, a field director and former carpentry instructor at Wind River Job Corps in Riverton. 
In a region of the state where high school dropout rates are high and traditional college paths aren’t the norm, Baldes said, Wind River Job Corps creates a viable pipeline for students to enter the workforce and earn high wages and good benefits. It helps keep youths out of the juvenile justice system, and is an important avenue for Wind River Indian Reservation youth.  
“Just in my trade alone, I’ve placed 15 students this year into jobs, six of them Native American,” Baldes told members of the Legislature’s Select Committee on Tribal Affairs last week. “So the national narrative that Job Corps isn’t working is very wrong. Job Corps is working, and it’s very effective, and it’s changing lives.”
Now, however, the free career training program for low-income young adults is in danger. The Trump administration proposed a significant cut to the Job Corps program following an initial call to eliminate funding entirely. The U.S. Department of Labor announced Thursday it will pause operations at contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide.
“It would be very unfortunate not to be able to continue that pipeline to small businesses and businesses around the state for these young men and women being trained by very good instructors,” Baldes said. 
Job Corps’ demise was among a chorus of warning bells rung during the meeting last week in Fort Washakie. Though the topic was not on the agenda, tribal representatives repeatedly raised worries that federal funding could end or decline for programs vital to Native communities.

The tenor underscored deep trepidation about impacts that could ripple from federal efforts to cut spending.  
Wind River Job Corps has clearly been a positive force in the state, committee member Rep. Ivan Posey, D-Fort Washakie, said. He remembered cedaring the dorms with his brother when the facility opened.
“I hope that [Wyoming’s congressional] delegation realizes that it’s been a boon to our economy here, and that it’s been a good thing for us,” he said. “It changes people’s lives.”
Education 
School leaders are keeping close watch on potential cuts that could impact tribal education, they told the committee. 
Though the Trump administration has apparently backed away from a proposal to eliminate Head Start funding, the threat remains, Eastern Shoshone Business Council Wayland Large said. 
“On this reservation, each district has a Head Start  — one in Fort Washakie, Ethete and Arapahoe,” Large said. The program, which is under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, provides early childhood education, health, nutrition and parent services to low-income families with children from birth to age 5.
Fremont County School District 38 Superintendent Curt Mayer, meanwhile, said his district is concerned about Impact Aid funding. That federal program provides financial assistance to local school districts with concentrations of children living on tribal lands as well as military bases and other federal property. 
District 38 officials travel to Washington, D.C. twice a year to secure the funding, Mayer said, which is used to fund counselors, nurses, school resource officers and cultural staff in the Arapahoe schools.

Deb Smith, superintendent of the Fort Washakie Schools in Fremont County School District 21, echoed that concern. 
“Impact Aid is huge for us,” Smith said. “So we’ve all been very worried about the funding, if it’s going to be there in the future.”
Committee chairman Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, asked about other implications. 
“It seems that the situation is evolving with respect to our federal partners in education,” Case said, “and I’m wondering what kind of implications are there, for example, with the elimination of the Department of Education?”
If the DOE goes away, Smith said, the hope is that Impact Aid can survive in a different federal department. Other areas of concern include federal funding for free and reduced lunch programs, Title I funds that help schools with high percentages of low-income students and similar programs.  
“We can’t provide some of the programming and resources without that funding,” she said. “And it’s scary. It’s very scary.”
Lawmakers listened sympathetically to Smith and others’ concerns but remained relatively mum. 
Higher ed
Central Wyoming College in Riverton has the state’s largest Trio Program, CWC President Dr. Brad Tyndall told the committee. The federal program offers outreach and services designed to provide pre-college services for people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
There are roughly 650 eligible students in the CWC service area, Tyndall said, and the college works with them by going through the high schools to identify and help students.  
“The recommendation from the White House budget is to cut all of that, and that would be devastating to our community, and especially our Native Americans, but it would be everybody,” he said. “The economic impact to the state is huge, and begs the question: ‘What do we do if that money goes away as a state?’”
College officials are also concerned about Native American-Serving Nontribal Institutions Program, or NASNTI, grants, Tyndall said, which are on hold. 
“But NASNTI is kind of dwarfed by Trio,” he said.

The college is also concerned about some changes to the Pell Grant availability in the federal budget bill, CWC Vice President of Student Affairs Coralina Daly said. 
The changes would require students to take 15 credits per semester. 
With many at-risk students, she said, taking 12 credits “is a significant load already. To ask them to take another class is really impeding their ability to be successful.”
There also is a proposal to cut Pell for part-time students, she added, “so all of these students that we know who are working and have these other obligations are going to have less access to aid.” 
Federal work study is also slated to be canceled in the budget bill, she said. “So that is another opportunity that would go away.” 
Of the funding coming to CWC’s self-identified tribal students, Daly said, “71% of those funds are coming from federal sources. That is disproportionately larger than our overall population.
“I think it’s important to note those federal funds are incredibly important for our tribal students,” she said. 
The federal budget bill, officially called the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, passed the U.S. House last week. It must still clear the Senate.
Uncertainty
Other areas of concern included Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which are both targeted for cuts. 
Conversations during the committee meeting also highlighted a high level of confusion related to when or how federal money will come through, the fact that some funds that were frozen have been released and if and how court intervention will impact programs.

For example, staff in the federal department that oversees the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIEAP, were eliminated this spring, spurring worries that the program would end. 
“It does help our elders and the community with the gas and the lights,” Eastern Shoshone Business Council member Latonna Snyder said. “So that’s a big issue.”
However, LIEAP in Wyoming has been funded through September, the Wyoming Department of Family Services announced this spring, adding that for the time being, no changes were anticipated.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)MACKINAC ISLAND – Republican leaders in the Michigan Legislature say they plan to support an initiative to hold a constitutional convention to rewrite the document.
The proposal automatically appears on the ballot every 16 years. The November 2026 general election will be the fourth time since the state’s current governing document, which went into effect in 1963, that voters decide whether to go back to the drawing board.
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said he does think we need a “Con-Con.”
“They stuff so many things in this Constitution, all kinds of things, every time,” Hall said, pointing to ballot proposals legalizing marijuana and creating an independent redistricting commission that were approved by voters as examples.
“Some of those proposals sounded good, but then had intentions that the public is frustrated about,” Hall said.
While Hall was focused on taking things out of the state’s constitution, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) sees it as an opportunity to make updates that he said Lansing leaders haven’t had the “political courage … to actually get done.”
Those include making the state superintendent an appointment of the governor rather than of the state Board of Education, as well as changes to how university boards are selected.
“I think there’s a lot of things that should be discussed,” Nesbitt, who is running for governor, said. “And the constitution could be a lot simpler than what it is right now.”
That simplification could touch all aspects of the state’s guiding document.
Eric Lupher,  president of the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan, previously told the Michigan Advance that if a constitutional convention were to be approved, “everything is fair game, from Article One through Article 12, so it’s not a piecemeal approach. It is an open document that will be examined from A-to-Z.”
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) said she hasn’t given it much thought but is open to hearing pros and cons.
House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) said he wasn’t familiar with specifics of the proposal but that it didn’t sound like something he would support.
If voters did call a constitutional convention, a special primary and general election for delegates would be held, with one delegate elected in each of the state’s 110 state House and 38 state Senate districts.
The convention would convene in October 2027 with no limit on how long it would last before proposing a new constitution, which voters would either approve or reject.
The legislative leaders were speaking during a Detroit Regional Chamber PAC reception during the final night of the Mackinac Policy Conference.
The unusually tense reception marked the first meeting of the four so-called “quadrant” leaders, representing the four key positions in the Michigan House and Senate, with no quadrant meetings having been held since last year.

Brinks said the Democratic majority in the Senate is willing to work with the Republican majority in the House on priorities like transparency reform and long-term road funding.
She said that starts by having more regular conversations.
“It’s important for us to sit down and negotiate the differences,” Brinks said. “That’s how the Legislature works, and it’s particularly important when we have a Republican-led House and Democratic-led Senate to sit down and just hash out those differences.”
Puri said it should be easy to set up plans for another meeting, pulling out his phone and saying he has time next Tuesday at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
But Hall said he doesn’t need to meet with the other legislative leaders, arguing that the House is getting things done on their own, though the state has seen just four bills signed into law so far this year.
Hall pointed to an Epic-MRA poll saying he has a 60% approval rating as evidence that his current strategy is working.
But Puri said the polling numbers aren’t indicative of the state’s actual perspectives.
“I congratulate the Speaker on his polling numbers. Contrary to what you’re saying, that was not statewide in Michigan, that was a select few lobbyists and Lansing insiders telling you that you’re doing a great job,” Puri said. “I don’t get my validation by pleasing lobbyists, and I see some in the room, I’m sorry. My validation is waking up to a family that loves me.”
Hall said he does work well with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, citing a positive vision while criticizing Brinks and Puri for offering a negative vision.
“I would encourage the Democrat leaders to empower your governor, Gretchen Whitmer,” Hall said. “Empower her in negotiations, and her and I will get a deal done, and we’ll get it done very quickly, on the budget, on roads, on many things.”

Ron Johnson at the Newsroom Pub on Wednesday, May 28, 2025 | Photo by Ruth Conniff/Wisconsin ExaminerYou have to hand it to Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson. As Republicans across the country run in fear from their constituents, refusing to hold town halls lest they be asked to answer for brutal federal budget cuts and threats to health care, nutrition assistance and Social Security, Johnson showed up at a Milwaukee Press Club event Wednesday and appeared cheerfully unperturbed as he took questions from journalists and a skeptical crowd. Not that his answers made sense.
People sitting in front of the podium at the Newsroom Pub luncheon crossed their arms and furrowed their brows as Johnson explained his alternative views on everything from global warming to COVID-19 to the benefits of bringing the federal budget more in line with the spending levels of 1930 — i.e. the beginning of the Great Depression, before FDR instituted New Deal programs Johnson described as “outside [the president’s] constitutionally enumerated powers.”
A handful of protesters chanted in the rain outside the Newsroom Pub, but overall, the event was cordial and reactions muted. In part, this was attributable to Johnson’s Teflon cockiness and the barrage of misinformation he happily unleashed, which had a numbing effect on his audience. 
Johnson fancies himself a “numbers guy.” In that way he’s a little like former House Speaker Paul Ryan, his fellow Wisconsin Republican who was once considered the boy genius of the GOP. Ryan made it safe to talk about privatizing Medicare by touring the country with a PowerPoint presentation full of charts and graphs, selling optimistic projections of the benefits of trickle-down economics, corporate tax cuts and the magic of the private market. But Ryan couldn’t stomach Trump and he’s been exiled from the party. Johnson is the MAGA version. While he doesn’t dazzle anyone with his brilliance, he does a good job of baffling his opponents with a barrage of B.S. that leaves even seasoned journalists scrambling to figure out what question to ask. Where do you begin?
Back in 2021, YouTube removed a video of Johnson’s Milwaukee Press Club appearance because he violated the platform’s community standards by spreading dangerous lies about COVID, the alleged harm caused by vaccines and the supposed benefits of dubious remedies. 
But this week he was back, proudly endorsing DHS Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate federal COVID vaccine recommendations for pregnant women and healthy children. While he hopes Kennedy goes further in rolling back vaccinations, he said, “at least we’re not going to subject our children to them anymore.”
A woman in the audience who identified herself as a local business owner seeking “common ground” thanked Johnson for saying “we don’t want to mortgage our children’s future,” but expressed her concern that besides the deficit spending Johnson rails against, there’s also the risk that we’re mortgaging the future by destroying the planet.
Johnson heartily agreed that everyone wants a “pristine environment.” “I mean, I love the outdoors,” he declared. But then he added, “We shouldn’t spend a dime on climate change. We’ll adapt. We’re very adaptable.” 
He claimed that “something like 1,800 different scientists and business leaders” have signed a statement saying there is no climate crisis. (The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that climate change is real and caused by people and the statement he referred to has been debunked.) “So if it’s climate change you’re talking about, we’re just at cross-purposes,” he added. “I completely disagree.”
Most of Johnson’s talk consisted of a fusillade of hard-to-follow budget numbers and nostrums like “the more the government spends the less free we are.” Charles Benson of TMJ4 News tried to get the senator to focus on what it would take to get him to go along with Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill. “So, a lot of numbers out there,” Benson said. “Can you give me a bottom line? Do you want 2 trillion? 3 trillion?”
“Your reaction is the exact same reaction I get from the White House and from my colleagues,” Johnson chided, “too many numbers. It’s a budget process. We’re talking about numbers. We’re talking about mortgaging our kids’ future.” 
Like his alternative beliefs about vaccination and climate science, Johnson’s budget math is extremely fuzzy. He asserted, repeatedly, that Medicaid is rife with “waste, fraud and abuse.” But the Georgetown University School of Public Policy has published a policy analysis dismantling claims that there is rampant waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid that concluded, “This premise is false, and the thinking is dangerously wrong.”
More broadly, Johnson claims that balancing the budget and reducing the federal deficit is his No. 1 concern. But he’s committed to maintaining historic tax cuts for the super rich. The only way to reduce deficits, in his view, is to enact even deeper cuts than House Republicans passed, increasing hunger, undermining education and rolling back health care — because he’s totally unwilling to increase revenue with even modest tax increases on corporations and the very wealthy. Those cuts, not a deficit that could be resolved by making the rich pay their share of taxes, are the real threat to our children’s future.
“I’m just a guy from Oshkosh who’s trying to save America,” Johnson said at the Press Club event. He recapped, in heroic terms, his lone stand against the 2017 tax cut for America’s top earners, which he blocked until he was able to work in a special loophole that benefitted him personally.
He told the panel of Wisconsin journalists he will also block Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill unless he sees deeper cuts, which he insisted would be easy to make. The 40 states that have taken the federal Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (which Johnson still calls “Obamacare”) are “stealing money from federal taxpayers,” he declared. Slashing Medicaid will be easy, he suggested, since “nobody would be harmed other than the grifters who are sucking down the waste, fraud and abuse.”
Grifters?
Wisconsin has 1.3 million Medicaid recipients. One in three children are on BadgerCare, as Medicaid is called here, along with 45% of adults with disabilities and 55% of seniors living in nursing homes. Our state program faces a $16.8 billion cut over 10 years under the House plan. During the Q&A session, I asked Johnson about this — not just the numbers, but the human cost. I brought up Shaniya Cooper, a college student from Milwaukee and a BadgerCare recipient living with lupus, who spoke at a press conference in the Capitol this week about how scary it was to realize she could lose her Medicaid coverage under congressional Republicans’ budget plan. 
“To me, this is life or death,” she said. She simply cannot afford to pay for her medicine out of pocket. When she first learned about proposed Medicaid cuts, “I cried,” she said. “I felt fear and dread.”
What does Johnson have to say to Cooper and other BadgerCare recipients who are terrified of losing their coverage?
“I’ll go back to my basic point,” Johnson replied. He quoted Elon Musk, whom he said he greatly admires for his DOGE work slashing federal agencies. “If we don’t fix this, we won’t have money for any of this [government in general],” he said Musk told him.
“Nobody wants the truly vulnerable to lose those benefits of Medicaid,” Johnson added. “But again, Obamacare expanded the waste, fraud and abuse of Medicaid, you know, expanding the people on it when, you know, when a lot of these people ought to be really getting a job.”
Some of Johnson’s Republican colleagues are worried about withdrawing health care coverage from millions of their constituents. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri called it immoral and “political suicide.” He said he won’t vote for the Medicaid cuts that passed the House because they will put rural hospitals out of business, and because too many hard-working, low-income people rely on the program for health coverage and simply cannot afford to buy insurance on the private market. 
But Johnson remains untroubled. He’s pushing for bigger and more damaging cuts. And when asked what he can tell his constituents who are afraid they’re about to lose life-saving health care, his answer is simple and unapologetic: Get a job.

To […]","Sen. Tim Sheehy, R-Montana, speaks to Kaitlan Collins on CNN about the Trump tariffs, confirming that Americans will feel economic pain (Screenshot CNN). It hasn’t been a good week for the guy who decided he was going to be a king and spent his first four months in office ignoring the law, declaring phony “national emergencies” and issuing “royal edicts” disguised as executive orders. 
But things didn’t go exactly as he hoped — to put it mildly.
To start, Wall Street, which has been wracked by his on again-off again tariffs, came up with a new moniker for him:  TACO.  That stands for “Trump Always Chickens Out” and is rooted in his failed attempts to pressure the nations of the world — including our longest and most loyal allies — with crushing tariffs to sell goods in the U.S.
Of course this didn’t sit well with his fragile ego and he demeaned a reporter who asked him what he thought of Wall Street’s label, falsely claiming our nation was “stone cold dead” before he took office and warning her to never use the term or ask that “nastiest question” again.  
That did not keep TACO Don out of the headlines, however. 
Next up on the hit list was Elon Musk announcing his time with the Trump administration has “come to an end.”  While Tesla sales were cratering and his latest Starship rocket was blowing up, he added insult to injury by declaring that the “big beautiful bill” Trump has been arm-twisting Congress to pass would accomplish the opposite of what he tried to do with the phony “Department of Government Efficiency” to cut government spending.  
Although causing incredible hardship and damage abroad and at home — including here in Montana — by Musk taking a chainsaw to government agencies, DOGE didn’t come close to meeting the goal of slashing a trillion dollars from the deficit.  In fact, on his way out the White House door he warned:“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.” 
The worst, however, was yet to come when the Court of International Trade issued a permanent injunction against his tariffs, ruling: “The challenged Tariff Orders will be vacated and their operation permanently enjoined.”  The unanimous ruling, including a Trump-appointed judge, found the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Trump attempted to use to declare his emergencies, “does not authorize the President to impose unbounded tariffs” and halted them immediately. 
Even though a federal appeals court halted the trade court’s injunction for now, it is obvious that the law doesn’t allow the president to slap the nation and world around, the entire premise on which his emergency declarations were based is phony. There is no Canadian fentanyl emergency and there is no rare earth minerals emergency threatening the nation’s defense capacity. As noted in a recent article on the potential for recovering those minerals from Montana’s Berkeley Pits which contains 50 billion gallons of toxic water: “A single F-35 fighter jet uses 900 pounds of rare-earth metals.” If our national defense was so threatened, one might credibly ask why we then sell F-35s all over the world?
TACO Don’s “golden age” is unravelling faster than “the weave” of lies and threats in his incoherent speeches.  One might think it would be a good time for Congress, including Montana’s all-GOP delegation, to acknowledge the failed policies and propaganda, get up off their knees, and get back to working on realistic, humane, and long-term policies that benefit the nation and their constituents here in Big Sky Country — not prop up the would-be dictator in the Oval Office.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sheehy-CNN.png,,,2025-05-30 06:59:02.474545

On Thursday a Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs accused O’Connell of “harboring” immigrants without legal status and “doxxing” immigration enforcement agents — echoing comments made by Tennessee 5th District Congressman Andy Ogles the day before.
“It certainly looks like Mayor O’Connell was involved in some sort of obstruction or the harboring of criminal illegal aliens in the great city of Nashville,” Tricia McLaughlin said in a media interview posted on the official X account of the Department of Homeland Security.
“But also just last night his office put out the names of Homeland Security investigators and doxxed our ICE enforcement officers,” she said. “They claimed it was a mistake. There’s zero chance it was a mistake and there will be repercussions.”

Late Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security published a list of cities, counties and states across the nation it said were “deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities.” The list came with this demand that “these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens.”
Nashville and Shelby County in west Tennessee, the county seat of Memphis, appear on the list, which was entitled “Sanctuary Jurisdictions Violating Federal Immigration Law.” Neither Nashville nor Shelby County have adopted so-called sanctuary city policies, which are barred under Tennessee law.
The accusations against O’Connell center on a longstanding executive order requiring city departments to report interactions with immigration officials.
O’Connell revised the order in early May to require the reporting to take place within 24 hours.

The revision took place in the midst of a joint operation by the Tennessee Highway Patrol and the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which led to the detainment of nearly 200 immigrants during traffic stops in South Nashville, a diverse neighborhood that is home to many of the city’s immigrant communities. The majority of those detained had no criminal records.
The mayor’s order requires all emergency and some non-emergency city agencies and officials to report any interaction with federal immigration to the Mayor’s Office of New and Indigenous Americans, a department created to foster civic participation.
The department posted a spreadsheet with summaries of the interactions on its website. As of Wednesday, there were 35 interactions reported between city officials and immigration authorities in May.
One entry identified an ICE analyst by first name. Two others listed the full names of Homeland Security Investigations officials. A fourth entry listed the full name of an immigration supervisor.
By Thursday morning, the names had been removed from the city’s website.
A statement from the mayor’s office said the names had been posted in error.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement “dragnet” in Nashville results in detentions

“It is not the normal practice to include the names of individuals in EO30 (the executive order) reporting. Any names mistakenly included have been removed.”
Questions to the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday to clarify McLaughlin’s comments about “repercussions” for the mayor’s actions went unanswered.
The public comments about O’Connell by federal officials came a day after the announcement by White House “border czar” Tom Homan that — as a result of O’Connell’s public stance against the mass enforcement actions — multi-agency immigration crackdowns could soon return to Nashville.
“We’ll flood the zone in the neighborhoods to find the bad guy. We’ll flood the zone at work sites to find the bad guy, but we’re going to do it, and he’s (O’Connell) not going to stop us,” said Homan, the White House executive director of enforcement and removal operations.
Earlier this week, Ogles held a press conference to denounce O’Connell, a Democrat, for “aiding and abetting illegal immigration.” Ogles accused the Nashville mayor of obstructing the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, citing O’Connell’s public statements and executive order.

Landry was seeking more authority over boards ranging from those that regulate certified public accountants, plumbers and engineers to ones overseeing nurses, dentists and physical therapists. The number of appointees Landry would have selected varied from group to group.

The legislation’s author, Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, said the current appointment system is problematic because it lets professional trade groups pick their own regulators. 
“The thought was to protect the consumer,” McMakin said at a public hearing this week. 
Sen. Greg Miller, R-Norco, backed McMakin’s bill and shared his concerns about the current structure of the boards. 
“The people who are supposed to be regulated are actually the ones doing the regulating,” Miller said. 

The bill closely resembles law changes Landry got approved last year that have already consolidated the governor’s power over state appointees. 
State lawmakers gave Landry the ability to appoint the chairs of 150 state boards and commissions directly instead of relying on the boards to pick their own leaders. These boards include the 32 Landry hoped to gain more control over through McMakin’s bill. 
Legislators also made changes in 2024 to the board of the Louisiana Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority to give the governor more say-so on members of that panel.
The legislature also permitted the governor more power over appointees to the Louisiana Board of Ethics. Landry now gets to pick his appointees directly instead of having to choose from lists of nominees from Louisiana’s private college and university leaders. 

On Wednesday, Senate committee members indicated the governor’s previous power grabs made them wary of handing Landry more authority. 
“Don’t you think that the way the bill is .. strips away the voice of the particular industry to offer up potential nominees?” asked Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, who voted against McMakin’s legislation. “It makes it, in a sense, purely political.”
“This kind of gives even more power to an already powerful executive branch,” Sen. Gary Carter, D-New Orleans, said. “I have grave concerns about it.” 
McMakin said safeguards already in place make sure the governor selects qualified board members. The governor’s appointees have to meet certain standards to serve, such as holding an occupational license in the field they would have to regulate. 
The governor’s appointees also do not make up the majority of any of the licensing boards in his bill, McMakin said. 
Sen. Larry Selders, D-Baton Rouge, remained unconvinced that the governor should be given more authority. 
“Where is the protection? Last year, we gave the governor the authority to appoint the chairmen. Now, we are giving the governor the authority to put two or three people – or various numbers – on different committees. And so when is it going to change again next year?” Selders said, before voting against the legislation. 

Despite the legislation failing, McMakin said the governor’s office could find a way to revive it before the legislature ends its session June 12. 

“The bill is not dead,” he said in an interview. 

Legislators have shown less tolerance for growing the governor’s authority, however. 

A constitutional amendment aimed at giving the governor two at-large appointees to the five-member Public Service Commission failed to get off the ground earlier this spring. Landry’s push to give him more sway over appointees to a New Orleans-area flood protection agency board has also died this session.

(Johnathan Cohen/Getty Images)Like an aggressive hog in the show ring, U.S. trade policy is attacking every other participant for existing near its space. For anyone who has ever watched a hog show with an aggressive hog, there are no winners or losers in the fights, just a bunch of bruised and annoyed animals. Since January, U.S. trade policy has been fixated on tariff tax increases, compelling consumers and trade partners to leave the ring bruised and annoyed.
These tax increases are not a strategic tool but simply fuel volatility. In the short term, this policy is not beneficial to America, especially American farmers. Though we may say, “To the victor go the spoils,” the only thing agriculture wins from a trade war of this scale and strategy is spoilage, as perishable products wait for an end destination. Just look at Idaho’s experience with reciprocal tariffs during the first Trump administration. There were a couple of short-term brags, but the failures are still accumulating costs.
In 2018, the threat of tariffs leveraged small improvements in trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, Japan, and China and motivated partners to the negotiating table for a few Idaho products, like potatoes. But most commodities, including potatoes, paid the million-dollar price tag of retaliatory tariffs. The dairy industry faced significant price cuts, resulting in direct payments to dairies. Wheat also became less competitive on the global market due to retaliatory tariffs, losing market share to competitors, which takes years to regain.
Though the president claimed that China paid the tariff bill on products like steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels, and other goods, it was retailers and consumers who absorbed the tax on goods. But despite millions of Americans paying this tax increase, it wasn’t consumers who saw rebates. A few farmers with political leverage snagged 92% of the tariff revenue into relief payments, providing another revenue stream to fuel the unprecedented farm aid, but the relief wasn’t consistent or enough to make up for the trade war damage. This history is likely to be repeated with the president’s new, larger trade war.
But here’s the frustration: It wasn’t only farmers who were hurt during the trade wars. Main Street USA was damaged significantly as businesses using tariffed goods lost sales, and the entire agricultural supply chain saw economic impacts, including job losses and costs to the average household of at least $300.
A 2024 study concluded that despite claims to help the American heartland, the 2018-2019 tariffs failed to provide relief. Import tariffs had “neither a sizable nor significant effect on US employment in regions with newly-protected sectors [and] by contrast had clear negative employment impacts, particularly in agriculture.”
With Idaho’s cash crop receipts down 6 percent year-over-year in 2024 and the state’s growing export markets (14% increase YOY), market instability from the trade war will be damaging. Idaho haystacks from 2024 are still unsold, while export-focused hay presses turn off machines and lay off workers. Wheat piles sit waiting for movement to ports as the new crop approaches harvest, because planting decisions were made last fall. Most Idaho commodities, like dairy, meat, and potatoes are feeling the effects of instability.
Though the current economic instability will hurt Idahoans, Idaho farmers should have no expectation that any relief packages targeted at agriculture will overpower the economic losses from another trade war. Idaho received 1.4 percent of total government payments to agriculture in 2020, and what was received was pennies on the dollar for industries facing losses.
Farming’s annual production cycle leaves little room for market responsiveness, especially when tariff announcements change weekly.
“We’re in this window where people are deciding what crops they’re going to plant,” Economist Brett Wilder of the University of Idaho said. “People have to make that decision right now and live with that decision through the rest of the year, even if something changes next week.”
With the recently announced 90-day pause, Idaho agricultural producers can only wait and see, hoping the glut of products moves enough in the next three months to prevent spoilage of the new crop.
Admittedly, the aggressive hog has reason to be annoyed at some participants, but the current trade tactic is failing American businesses, farmers, and most importantly citizens.
Yes, improvements in the trade deficit, protection of environmental concerns and labor reform, and boosting manufacturing and critical industries are all concerns of many Americans that need addressing. But, as history has repeatedly shown, tariff tax increases will only cause products and work to spoil as America watches trading partners leave our show ring.

(AFGE webstream)Brendan Demich was on a bus to Washington, D.C. last week to attend a rally outside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ office.
At the same time, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was assuring lawmakers that critical programs in his department, specifically those protecting coal miners, would continue despite drastic cuts to his agency’s staff and budget.
It was the third in a series of contentious hearings for Kennedy. And for Demich, a Pennsylvania employee of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a research agency in Kennedy’s department, they were hard to stomach.
He’s part of a roughly 100-person team at NIOSH’s Bruceton facility in Allegheny County that studies the best ways to prevent injuries, illnesses and death in coal mines. Last month, he and all of his colleagues were notified that their jobs would be eliminated in June. Another team in Spokane, Washington, focused on safety in non-coal mines received similar notices.
Combined, they conduct the bulk of the agency’s mine safety research.
“[Kennedy]’s claiming that he hasn’t fired any scientists, and that the only people that they’re cutting are doing duplicative work, but that is absolutely not the case,” Demich told the Capital-Star. “Our titles may be engineers, but we do science … And there’s no other agency that does the work we do here at NIOSH.”
The picture Demich paints is different from Kennedy’s.
“The work at NIOSH will not be interrupted,” Kennedy responded to a question from a lawmaker about layoffs. “The work on mine safety will continue. We understand it’s critically important to function and we don’t want to see it end.”
The hearings took place over the last three weeks after reports emerged that critical and legally required programs to help miners with black lung disease were no longer functioning, after an estimated 90% of NIOSH’s roughly 1400 full-time staff were laid off, offered early retirement or placed on administrative leave pending termination in early April.
Miners developing black lung, an irreversible and degenerative disease, were suddenly not able to get approved for a program facilitating transfers to less dusty mines. Black lung screenings that can help miners with the disease receive federal benefits were also stopped.
This led to a class action lawsuit and pressure from Republican lawmakers to reverse the layoffs of federal workers whose jobs were ensuring mine safety.
So, earlier this month, Kennedy brought back over 300 NIOSH employees, including the Morgantown, West Virginia, team that studies black lungs and ensures benefits for programs for miners who develop it continue to function.
Kennedy also restored a team focused on the health of 9/11 first responders, as well as a team that works on the same Pittsburgh campus as Demich’s that tests and certifies respirators used by miners, firefighters and other professionals.
But Demich’s division is still expecting to be laid off.
Earlier this month, at a meeting, Demich said Pittsburgh employees in the mine safety division were told they no longer had to come into work, though a handful still do.
There had been hope with the Trump administration’s rhetoric around increasing coal mining and U.S. Health Department’s statements on the importance of miner safety that the job cuts would be reversed. But when NIOSH staff in other departments were brought back, Demich said, ”it crushed morale in the mining division. A lot of people see it as writing on the wall that we’re not being saved.”
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to detailed questions from the Capital-Star about future plans for the mine research divisions. But a spokesperson provided a statement saying, “Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary’s leadership, NIOSH’s essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations. Ensuring the health and safety of our workforce remains a top priority for the Department.”
Demich finds HHS statements on preserving critical programs frustrating, given the cuts on his and similar teams.
“I don’t know how you can say that you’re maintaining essential services for coal workers and miners when you’re cutting the divisions that mainly do the research and provide the services to prevent mine injuries, illnesses and fatalities,” he said. “Our work does not overlap at all with the [Morgantown] division, other than that we both want to prevent black lung.”

‘Those functions are going to disappear’ 
There is virtually no operational mine in the United States that hasn’t implemented safety measures based on research conducted by NIOSH.
The U.S. government got into mine safety research when the Bureau of Mines was established in 1910, after a series of deadly explosions killed hundreds of miners in just a few short years. The bureau was tasked with researching safer practices, inspecting mines and collecting data on the industry.
The work was successful. For decades, miner fatality rates steadily and precipitously decreased. That continued after the Bureau of Mines was shuttered and effectively rolled into the Department of Health and Human Services in the 1990s, where it now sits.
NIOSH’s mine safety divisions don’t set or enforce rules, but research it conducts has led to breakthroughs in technology that detects coal dust levels in real time, prevents mine roofs from collapsing, increases mineshaft ventilation and provides barriers between miners and powerful explosions.
“Those functions are going to disappear and I’m not quite sure who else would be able to do those,” said Tony Iannacchione, a former employee of NIOSH’s coal mine safety team who now teaches at the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering. “There’s some pretty unique expertise. And if you don’t have a government agency that’s keeping its thumb on the pulse and coming up with modifications and improvements to the systems being used in mines, we’re gonna be in a bad way.”
Iannacchione says that work is only getting more important. The more coal that’s extracted, the deeper miners have to dig to find it. That makes for more dangerous mines and requires new research and safety protocols.
“As you go deeper, you get higher concentrations of methane gas and all these problems just get worse,” he said. “For the industry to react to all these problems, it’s really beyond their capability. You need the government involved.”
Iannacchione cited recent NIOSH research that set new industry standards for blast walls that are placed between miners and explosives, as well as new methods for placing roof supports. The Pittsburgh team has also done extensive work on preventing hearing loss, which is an issue in underground mines that are full of loud machinery.
The coal mine safety team in Pittsburgh is also developing technology that can read silica dust levels in real time, but that has yet to be deployed. As miners dig into tougher terrain, they’re exposed to much more silica dust, which has led to an increase in the development of silicosis and black lung among younger miners and develops at an accelerated rate. Widespread use of real time monitors, Iannacchione said, could save lives. But it’s unclear if the work will be finished by the time the layoffs fully take effect in June.
Demich, the chief steward of the union representing Pittsburgh-area NIOSH workers, said he was working on a virtual reality training program for first responders and rescue teams to simulate mine disasters. They had begun training teams around the country, but the cuts effectively ended that work. He believes, with a little more time, they could have brought it to almost every mine rescue team in the U.S.
‘Benefit of the doubt’ 
Sam Petsonk has been an advocate for coal miners for his entire career. The West Virginia-based lawyer led the recent lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services that resulted in an injunction ruling last week, effectively requiring the return of NIOSH workers running Black Lung programs in Morgantown.
He successfully argued that the department was breaking the law by effectively shuttering congressionally-approved programs for miners with black lung by laying off the staff that implemented them. But, as he sees it, the law also requires the kind of research done by NIOSH’s teams that are still facing layoffs.
“These Pittsburgh programs are every bit as mandatory under the Mine Act,” Petsonk told the Capital-Star. “I would like to give Secretary Kennedy a bit of the benefit of the doubt here that he’s still digesting his obligations here.”
But the mandate is far less clear, with statute generally requiring NIOSH to conduct “research, demonstrations, and experiments” to support the Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration, which sets and enforces rules for mine companies to follow.
The injunction ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Irene Berger focused on the availability of black lung programs, but also said “the Court orders that there be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services mandated by Congress in the Mine Act and the attendant regulations for the health and safety of miners.”
Asked if he would bring a lawsuit if the mine safety research teams are not brought back, Petsonk said he wants to wait until the end of the 20-day period that Berger allowed to comply with the injunction. That will be on June 2.
“If they look at it, they will see the need to revive the mining research labs within NIOSH,” Petsonk said.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star about whether it believes the injunction applies to the research teams, or whether law requires them to be operational.
“They should just follow the law and re-open the research labs in Pittsburgh and Spokane because miners need it,” Petsonk said.
While it’s unclear if a legal remedy would be available to advocates like Petsonk who want mine safety research at NIOSH to continue, Demich is trying another way. When he was in Washington, D.C. last week, he and his NIOSH colleagues met with the staff of an estimated 15 to 20 lawmakers in an attempt to inform them about the research being lost and ask them to restore their jobs and research funding.
As it stands, even though Demich and his coworkers in Allegheny County are still technically employed, strict limits on research spending and travel would prevent them from doing a lot of their previous work.
Demich would not say which lawmakers’ staff he and his colleagues met with, since discussions are still ongoing. But he said the initial conversations were promising. He personally met with staff from lawmakers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. He did note they were two Democrats and two Republicans.
“There’s a lot of questions about coal mines and about all the work we’re doing here in Pittsburgh,” Demich said. “A lot of people want  to follow-up and I think we’ll be reaching out.”

Underinsured and not qualifying for Medicaid, she had to search for a local nonprofit to pay for her sight-saving surgeries. (Nada Hassanein | Stateline)COLUMBIA, S.C. — It’s as if she’s squinting through a smoke-filled room. But it’s Charisse Brown’s eye condition, glaucoma, that diminishes her vision.
Brown, 38, has worked all her adult life, with a personal policy of keeping two jobs at once. But when she started losing sight in her left eye last year, she was forced to quit her call center job. That left her with one income stream, her marketing research job, to pay her $1,300 monthly rent and other bills.
If glaucoma is caught early, monitored by a doctor and properly treated, it’s possible to stall the progression of the disease. Eye drops are necessary for keeping eye pressure down to slow glaucoma-induced damage. Without insurance, the monthly cost of the medication can run anywhere from $80 per bottle for a generic version to $200 or $300 for a brand-name one.
As an adult without children, Brown doesn’t qualify for Medicaid in South Carolina, which has not expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act. 
She’s enrolled in the lowest-premium plan on her state’s health care insurance marketplace, but ophthalmologists in the area won’t accept her insurance.
She said she called 211, a hotline for community services, but her voicemails weren’t returned. In medical debt and about to get kicked out of her apartment, she had to choose between her medication and paying for daily necessities like food and feminine care items. One food stamps enrollment worker told her: “We can’t approve you. If you go and have a baby, this will be a lot easier.”
“Single people — we’re struggling,” Brown said. “I feel like I’m getting punished for trying to do what’s right.”
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause a buildup of pressure that damages the optic nerve. Long called the “thief of sight,” it’s the leading cause of blindness in Black Americans like Brown. Black people are five times more likely to have glaucoma, and lose their sight at six times the rate of white people. Hispanic and Latino communities suffer similar disparities.
Among Black patients, a timely diagnosis is paramount: Glaucoma occurs on average a decade earlier — and advances faster.
But diagnosis and treatment can be costly and out of reach for many.
In South Carolina and the other nine states that have not expanded Medicaid, opponents of expansion say it would be too expensive to provide health coverage to more people, even though the federal government picks up 90% of the tab. But forgoing expansion also has costs. People without insurance or not enough insurance are more likely to visit the emergency room, as glaucoma and other chronic diseases take their toll. When it comes to eye diseases, vision can deteriorate without coverage for preventive care. And racial health disparities are higher in states that have not expanded.
“You see a lot of end-stage disease,” said Dr. Rebecca Epstein, a glaucoma specialist and ophthalmologist at South Carolina’s Clemson Eye, which was not involved in Brown’s care. “They don’t have insurance, and so they will delay care. And then they come in, one eye is already gone, another eye is on its way — and I’m sitting here having to tell them I’ve got to operate on their only eye.”
For about two months, Brown was fully blind in her left eye. Surgeries to address her warping cornea, a condition called keratoconus, and another to relieve pressure causing her glaucoma would cost upward of $10,000. Asked if they could offer a payment plan, her doctor’s office staff said no.
For days, Brown and her siblings called dozens of charities, asking for help to pay for her surgery. They called doctors across the state, asking if they had the necessary surgeon specialists and whether they accepted her insurance. Some nonprofits told Brown she was too young, that their help was reserved for older adults.
She finally landed on the South Carolina charity Lions Vision Services, affiliated with Lions Club International. The group offers eyeglasses, vision screenings and reimbursements to local doctors for surgeries patients living below the poverty line can’t afford. The charity told her it could pay for her eye surgeries, and Brown was in disbelief.










You don't give them access to care. You let them go blind, and then you're going to pay for their disability when they go blind?


– Dr. Rebecca Epstein, ophthalmologist at Clemson Eye


“Access shouldn’t be this hard. Our state should do a better job of making sure that we have coverage for people and that they have access to care — before they’re blind,” Epstein said. “Here’s the crazy thing to think about: So, you don’t give them access to care. You let them go blind, and then you’re going to pay for their disability when they go blind, right? How backwards is that?”
Had she not gotten the surgeries, Brown would have lost sight completely in that left eye, doctors told her.
Before she found Lions, the search had been so frustrating that she told her mother through tears, “Maybe I should just let this eye go.”
‘Shoulder that burden’
Since Brown could no longer drive, she’d take Uber rides across town for her frequent appointments. For appointments in Charleston with her surgeon, her mother would drive from Myrtle Beach to Columbia, 2 1/2 hours away, for another two-hour drive to Charleston. After one surgery, she developed an infection and had to visit her Columbia doctor daily — $30 roundtrip — because her case was so critical. Knowing she couldn’t afford the appointments, her doctor stopped charging her at follow-ups.
Servants for Sight, a faith-based nonprofit that helps South Carolinians in poverty pay for vision care, offers to pay for surgeries, treatments and Uber rides to eye care appointments. Rideshares have helped people “not only start their care, but complete their care,” said Amy Evette, executive director of Servants for Sight.
The group also runs a mobile vision screening unit that visits communities across northwestern South Carolina. Volunteers and staff screen for signs of diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy inside the white-and-green van, and connect patients to ophthalmologists for further care. The van is equipped with retinal imaging equipment and rows of free sunglasses. On the outside are logos of various eye care centers and nonprofits who volunteer to help.

“If people don’t have insurance or are not able to afford an eye exam once a year, it’s very difficult for them to detect any kind of eye disease,” said Sandra Torres, an ophthalmic technician of 17 years. The group works with homeless shelters, and she says many people end up on the streets because they lose their sight, and then their jobs.
The vehicle saw a busy recent Thursday morning in Spartanburg, a city of about 38,000 people roughly 30 miles southeast of Greenville. Stationed in the parking lot behind a free medical clinic, staff prepared for nearly three dozen patients scheduled that day.
Multiple residents filed into the van throughout the morning, many with thick contact casts wrapped around their calves and feet, used to heal and protect diabetic ulcers. Diabetes, which increases the risk of glaucoma, disproportionately affects people with lower incomes and communities of color, amid structural barriers to affordable health care and healthier food.

Angela Garrett, a local pastor, has been grappling with blurred vision and diabetes. Uninsured, she came to the unit to get her eye pressure and vision checked. Garrett, 55, is also recovering from a recent open-heart surgery. A caregiver for older adults, she said she’ll apply for Medicaid as soon as she’s recovered and can go back to work. In South Carolina, the income limit for a single person who is blind or living with a disability is $15,650.
She’s passionate about caregiving, a pursuit “from the heart,” even though her job is “the bottom of pay in medical,” she said. Despite her modest income, she may not qualify for Medicaid.
Often, patients don’t know help is available, or they stop coming to their appointments because they can’t drive and lack transportation, or they’re unable to pay, said Dr. Peter Daniel, another ophthalmologist and glaucoma specialist who works with the nonprofits. He recalled a glaucoma patient who stopped showing up for appointments. The man began to weep when Daniel told him not to worry about the cost and connected him with the charities.
“They’re in very difficult socioeconomic and complex situations,” Daniel said. “And those are the folks that I worry about going blind.”
Columbia optometrist Dr. Kendria Cartledge sees late-diagnosed glaucoma “daily.” She said the majority of her patients are on Medicaid, and that not enough eye care providers accept the public insurance program, putting more pressure on the ones who do.

The state Medicaid eligibility redetermination process has complicated matters. Patients may have had Medicaid in the past and are still struggling financially, but as states cull the rolls, they may lose coverage without knowing it. With glaucoma patients and others at risk of losing vision, timely care gets interrupted.
“A lot of these patients are getting lost to follow-up,” said Cartledge, who has been treating whole families with the disease among multiple siblings for years, building a relationship with them. “Some expansion would definitely help out these patients have better outcomes, have a better quality of life.”
The gigantic tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week could make that situation worse. The measure would cut federal Medicaid spending by $625 billion over 10 years, largely by enacting new work rules and additional paperwork requirements. The changes would remove about 7.6 million people from the Medicaid rolls over the next decade, according to initial estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
Ophthalmologists like Daniel give care knowing they’re losing money, even after partial reimbursement from charities.
“If a charity can carry that burden, why can’t our state and federal systems help shoulder that burden? We do it for older patients, we do it for our Medicare population,” said Epstein, the Clemson Eye ophthalmologist. “Why can’t we do it for our younger patients?”
When ‘all else fails’
 Clad in a bright yellow tunic and woven sun hat, Jekeithlyn Ross stopped by the Servants for Sight check-in table to introduce herself. Only she didn’t have to. Marion Keller already knew Ross was the daughter of eye disease advocate J.C. Stroble as soon as she spoke her dad’s name. Keller has a bobblehead figurine of Stroble in her curio cabinet.

Ross has been on a mission to relaunch her nonprofit, the J.C. Stroble Glaucoma Awareness Foundation. Dormant during COVID-19, the organization is named for her late dad, who had glaucoma and was blind. The eye care advocate and Spartanburg icon died in 2013 at 71.
“Trying to get services to those that are falling between the cracks or the socioeconomically challenged is a challenge,” Ross said. “What we’re trying to do is go to the people, try to get the services to decrease the rate of blindness here.”
A volunteer with the South Carolina Lions Club and speaker at churches and national and local civic events, Stroble was also well-known in the community for his boisterous order-calling at the local fast-food fixture, the Beacon Drive-In. The eatery, where he was nicknamed the “Beacon Barker,” is popular among locals and as a stop on campaign trails.

At the Servants for Sight check-in table, the excitement was palpable: Ross and Keller talked about their mirrored missions as if they were old friends. Keller shared that she had a cornea transplant, and before they parted ways, she and Ross blew each other a kiss. “This is a marriage. This is only the beginning,” Ross said.
Ross said she was aware of glaucoma because of her dad, but others without exposure might not know the importance of getting their eyes checked, or even that it runs in their families.
“We’re back in action — because the need is great,” Ross said. “Education, awareness is the key. It’s essential, and it’s not enough foot soldiers out there putting that message out.”
She’s been going to churches, civic groups, clinics and mobile units to spread the word about the foundation.
“Nonprofits pick up the pieces. We have a little joke: ‘When the government and all else fails, then you come to us,’” she said with a wry chuckle. “Because what do you do? You help.”
‘Like looking through a plastic sandwich bag’
Servants for Sight helped pay for glaucoma surgery and eye drops for 71-year-old Jimmie “Coach Sheek” Robinson. The retired school bus driver and Little League coach said he’s had trouble accessing Medicare.

“It was like looking through a plastic sandwich bag,” he recalled. “I’m asking, ‘Lord, what is happening to my eyes?’”
Often running in families, glaucoma can sneak up in those with 20/20 vision all their life, like Robinson.
He couldn’t see his fellow churchgoers’ hands, extended to greet him with a handshake. He’d have to explain that his peripheral vision was waning.
Handshakes matter at Piney Grove Baptist, a small congregation with scarlet carpets in Anderson, about 30 miles southwest of Greenville. A “flimsy grip won’t do it,” said one deaconess at the podium on a recent Sunday. “You can tell someone loves you,” she said, by their handshake.
“Shake my hand,” she exclaimed as parishioners laughed. “Show up with love.”
That day, Robinson, donning glasses, was able to do that. Throughout the sermon, he’d wave his hand in prayer over his daughter and grandchildren, who filled the pew behind him.
“I’m not going to get depressed over my eye,” he said. “God been good to me.”
Back in Columbia, with those costly prescriptions, doctor and rideshare visit costs adding up, Charisse Brown said she is now steeped in about $7,500 in debt, with Uber costs totaling $1,500 alone. She’s kept a GoFundMe up to try to chip away at bills through donations.

She has just moved into another apartment, a gray-floored two-bedroom, where rent is $300 cheaper than her previous one-bedroom flat. Leaving lights on at night, along with the beaming lamppost right outside her back door, helps her navigate her apartment after dark.
“That’s pretty much the only way that I am able to see, is enough light is coming in, especially in my left eye,” she said.
Brown said her friends have noticed her own light dimming.
Friends have always called her “Kumbaya” for her outgoing and positive attitude. But after her vision crisis, she fell into despair. She stopped going out, self-conscious about the appearance of her left eye, which is sometimes swollen and has strabismus. Because she can’t hop in her car for a spontaneous road trip like she used to, she’s leaned on her personal avatar in the online game “Second Life,” where she simulates going to the beach and streams her pastor’s sermons, as if she’s sitting in the pews.
She’s trying to lift her spirits by writing poetry and tending to her plants. In the corner of her sparsely furnished living room sits a fern she’s named Duchess, a pothos called Prince and a few other small pots, studded with budding succulents.
Sitting on the couch, she reads from her poem “Overcome.” She’d been lying in the hospital bed after a surgery, using speech-to-text to write:
Darkness and light both dwell in the same universe, but light always outshines – so I nicknamed myself ‘Bright,’
To be able to blind the Dark from coming my way.
It’s so blinding that maybe he would give up
And leave me alone today.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Tennessee’s private prison operator is suing a consultant for $500 million for allegedly stealing a contract for non-detention services with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
CoreCivic, a Brentwood-based company that runs four Tennessee prisons, filed suit against Universal Strategic (US) Advisors this year, claiming it breached a deal to bring in business for CoreCivic by landing its own $73 million contract with ICE in March. The case was filed in Metro Nashville Circuit Court, but US Advisors is seeking removal.
Wanting to expand its web beyond federal and state prison operations, CoreCivic hired US Advisors for $30,000 a month to help it ink an agreement with ICE to handle administrative work dealing with undocumented immigrants who are under federal supervision. The job involves people who are released from detention on humanitarian grounds, bond or parole, those waiting for removal after immigration proceedings or people classified as fugitives from ICE or should be removed for other reasons, according to the filing. 
The idea was to enable ICE agents to work the front lines amid increased deportations under the Trump administration with CoreCivic taking over personnel and administrative work such as checking records, collecting documents, answering phone calls, entering data and doing criminal history checks.
CoreCivic signed a one-year contract with US Advisors and paid the company $1.56 million. But, according to the lawsuit, shortly after President Donald Trump was sworn in, the consulting firm notified CoreCivic in early February it was ending the contract in 30 days.
Both companies hoped to take advantage of inside contacts.
US Advisors’ chief executive officer, Tim Robbins of Utah, had held numerous leadership jobs in ICE and was an old acquaintance of Bart Verhulst, vice president of federal relations for CoreCivic. He was privy to the CoreCivic’s proprietary information and helped shape its plan to “penetrate” the Department of Homeland Security market. 
CoreCivic contends Robbins was supposed to avoid conflicts of interest, and he helped CoreCivic submit a proposal to ICE in 2023 for case management services. It was re-submitted in August 2024 and January, and CoreCivic was told that ICE was interested in its proposal. But “out of the blue,” on Feb. 9, CoreCivic received a letter from US Advisors terminating their agreement.
In early March, “much to its shock and dismay,” CoreCivic found out US Advisors and Robbins, while under contract, submitted their own proposal to ICE and then won the contract.
Is there no honor among profiteers?
We hate money
Tennessee is using a vendor on shaky ground in other states to send out the money for its private-school voucher programs.
The state has been contracting with Student First Technologies for two years, with an annual licensing fee of $695,000, for the Education Savings Accounts targeting low-income students in three counties and its Individualized Education Account program for special needs students, according to the Department of Education.
The department executed an amendment to the contract in early April to launch the so-called Education Freedom Scholarships for up to 20,000 students, depositing money into students’ online accounts to pay for tuition and other expenses at private schools, but not directly to parents. The legislature’s Fiscal Review Committee approved the expansion in March at a cost of $625,000 for the initial buildout and launch.
Despite Breakdowns in Two States, ESA Provider Student First Seeks to Expand

Privatizing education isn’t cheap. 
The newest iteration is costing north of $140 million annually, at least half of it going to students already enrolled in private schools, while the cost for ESAs could reach $25 million a year. Add the $1.3 million for disseminating money, and you’re creating a cottage industry.
The problem is that Student First Technologies promised West Virginia officials in September 2024 it wouldn’t go after more business until it repaired glitches that caused more than 3,000 unfilled orders and forced parents to spend their own money for books, technological equipment and other services, according to a States Newsroom report.
Besides those shortcomings, Student First lost a $15 million contract for an Arkansas voucher program when it couldn’t do the job correctly.
Tennessee and Student First have run into some of their own technical problems, but the company apparently has handled them. And instead of looking for another vendor, the state is doubling down with more work and a bigger contract.
The state’s relationship with Student First comes on the heels of a $2.5 million no-bid contract with Florida-based ClassWallet that used Career Ladder funds for teachers to pay the tab. Former Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn, who is going for a deputy secretary position in the U.S. Department of Education, caught the ire of lawmakers when she inked the deal without taking bids.
Which is worse, skipping the bidding process or sticking with a company facing lawsuits for shoddy work? It’s a toss-up.

The inquest continues
Nashville Democrats are trying to recall Metro Councilman David Benton after his appearance with xenophobic U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles in an anti-immigrant press conference at the State Capitol, on Memorial Day no less.
While Ogles accused Metro Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell of opposing President Trump’s efforts to deport people without legal documentation, Democrats are peeved that Benton is backing the move to “Stop the invasion.” 
Recalling a Metro Council member could be difficult. The last time it happened took place way back in 2009 when Nashville attorney Jamie Hollin defeated Pam Murray, who was tied up in turmoil over allowing mobile vendors on Cleveland Street.
Aside from Democrats, the Metro Council’s Immigrant Council also condemned Benton, saying his “racist” propaganda is especially problematic because he represents a district with a large Latino population, which was targeted by ICE in a South Nashville roundup two weeks ago. 
Nashville immigrant caucus 5-29-25
Never mind that many of the people Ogles and his ilk want to deport are washing the dishes, cooking the food and changing the bed sheets for white-bread America. 
Also put out of your mind that a handful of state lawmakers, mainly from Williamson County, used the State Capitol on a federal holiday to conduct a publicity stunt inside the Old Supreme Court chambers on the first floor, which is controlled by the governor. 
According to one report, the event was moved abruptly into the Capitol because of the threat of rain. But a press release sent out on Friday, May 23, said it would be held in the Old Supreme Court. 
Did it rain that day?

Last month, Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary and longtime anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral for the second unvaccinated child in Texas to have died in the ongoing measles outbreak. While in Texas, he met with the two grieving families — along with two local doctors promoting unproven measles treatments, whom he called “extraordinary healers.” 
Following the first death, Children’s Health Defense (CHD), the anti-vax organization Kennedy led until recently, pushed its own narrative claiming that the 6-year-old Mennonite girl did not actually die from the measles. In this effort, CHD has relied heavily on Pierre Kory, a Wisconsin doctor who has both amplified that assertion and claimed that the measles virus has been weaponized by unknown conspirators.
Kory is a Kennedy ally who has been widely criticized for spreading Covid misinformation during the pandemic, including pushing the use of ivermectin as a “miracle drug” for treating that virus. 
For years, CHD and Kennedy have promoted the debunked claim that the standard measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine given to almost all children in the U.S. is tied to autism. With an upsurge in the pandemic-era, right-wing embrace of the anti-vax movement — and of Kennedy himself — there has been a notable decrease in routine pediatric vaccinations in the U.S. 
Now that measles immunization rates have fallen below thresholds to maintain herd immunity in certain parts of the country, outbreaks such as the one in West Texas are expected to become more common. In February, Texas reported the country’s first measles death in a child in the more than two decades since the disease was classified as eradicated in the U.S. 
In response to this death, CHD posted a video on March 19 featuring Kory and Ben Edwards, another Texas doctor Kennedy applauded, discussing the girl’s medical records, which her parents released to the organization. 
Despite having no training in pediatric medicine and having had his board certifications in internal medicine and critical care revoked last year, Kory claimed the child’s death was due to incorrect antibiotic management of a bacterial pneumonia infection that had “little to do with measles.” Edwards — a family doctor who has been treating measles-stricken children in Texas with medications not indicated for measles and was accused of seeing pediatric patients while actively infected with measles himself — concurred with Kory. 
Without being able to examine the medical records themselves, pediatricians consulted for this article were limited in their critique of Kory’s assessment. But they did question his understanding of empiric antibiotic recommendations for pediatric pneumonia. Secondary bacterial pneumonia infections following viral diseases are common, and pneumonia is a well-documented complication of a measles infection. 
These doctors also questioned the strong personal bias underpinning Kory’s assessment and pointed to his history of extreme claims about Covid made online and to right-wing media outlets  as evidence against his reliability as an “expert.” 
Furthermore, Kory has been inconsistent in his messaging around this measles death when addressing various audiences. When Alex Morozov, founder of the counter-misinformation group Eviva Partners, confronted Kory about his statements regarding the young girl’s cause of death at the so-called “Summit for Truth & Wellness” on March 29, the answer he got was very different. At that event, Kory suggested this was a case of the measles being “weaponized.”
In an audio recording of their conversation published by Morozov, Kory said: 
Do you want to know the real story on this case? Quite a few of us believe that they weaponized the measles virus. And this measles is more. They’re doing this on purpose. She got sicker from the measles probably because they monkeyed with the measles virus…. Do you know how many bioweapons labs there are and what they can do?
Like the unfounded claim of an error in medical treatment, this “weaponized measles” narrative has spread rapidly throughout the online crankosphere. However, this conspiratorial rhetoric has not been accompanied by urgent recommendations for increased vaccinations to prevent infection from a supposedly more virulent strain.
Kennedy, who promoted pandemic conspiracy theories along with ivermectin as an alternative to Covid vaccines, has called Kory “honest, brave, and sincere” and “a brave dissident doctor.” The doctor appeared with him at various campaign-related events in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, both before and after RFK Jr. suspended his own campaign and joined forces with Trump to launch the “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement. 
As ivermectin proved to be ineffective against Covid, Kory turned on the life-saving mRNA vaccines while cozying up to Kennedy and CHD. Kory and the ivermectin group he co-founded — the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), now called the Independent Medical Alliance following a pro-MAHA rebrand — have rallied with Kennedy and CHD on multiple occasions, including against Covid vaccine mandates during the deadly Omicron wave in late 2021 and early 2022.
Kory has not just turned on Covid vaccines, but routine childhood immunizations in line with Kennedy’s and CHD’s established anti-vax rhetoric as well. 
In 2023, Kory appeared in an FLCCC webinar about pediatric vaccines titled “Your Child, Your Choice.” The same year, despite his lack of pediatric credentials, he served as an “expert” on the issue of childhood vaccinations for Republicans in Wisconsin.
That same year, Kory testified at the Wisconsin Capitol as part of a GOP-led effort to block adding the meningitis vaccine as a state requirement for school-aged children, which is  required in many other states and has been recommended by the Center for Disease Control’s Advisory Council on Immunization Practices since 2005. (While Kory and company were initially successful, the meningitis vaccine was eventually added to Wisconsin’s requirements as of the 2023/24 school year.) 
During this measles outbreak, both Kennedy and Kory have once again promoted “alternative” treatments. 
Kennedy has drawn heavy criticism for pushing vitamin A as a treatment for measles while simultaneously failing to provide a sorely needed, full-throated endorsement of the MMR vaccines. Following the second death, while the HHS secretary correctly called the vaccines the “most effective way” to prevent measles, he quickly undermined his own statement. In his tweet about the funeral, Kennedy included a shoutout to doctors Edwards and Richard Bartlett, his other “extraordinary healer” from Texas, for their use of unproven treatments on infected children in the local community. 
On March 31, Kory appeared in another CHD video about the first Texas child’s death, claiming she should have received intravenous vitamin C, which is not indicated for measles-related pneumonia. Of note, prior to his co-authorship of questionable papers on the use of ivermectin to fight Covid, Kory co-authored a since-retracted paper on a Covid hospital protocol that featured vitamin C.
Given his past statements on Covid and routine pediatric vaccines as well as his ties to Kennedy and CHD, Kory would have a vested interest in distancing himself from children’s deaths from vaccine-preventable illness. But this is dangerous, experts warn, during a measles outbreak where vaccines play a vital role in stopping the spread of disease.
A representative for the hospital that treated the first child spoke out against “misleading and inaccurate claims” about this case being circulated online. “Our physicians and care teams follow evidence-based protocols and make clinical decisions based on a patient’s evolving condition, diagnostic findings, and the best available medical knowledge,” the spokesperson said.
CHD did not back down in the wake of the second pediatric measles death early last month. The organization requested hospital records for this case while offering a free e-book — featuring a foreword by Kennedy — on “secrets the government and media aren’t telling you about measles and the measles vaccine.” The book accuses the mainstream media of weaponizing outbreaks “for political gain.” 
In an email to their followers on April 7 — the day after the second child’s funeral — CHD announced an April 17 webinar event called “Inside the Measles Deception” featuring Kory, Booker, and Edwards. The restricted event was available only to their donors. 
On April 8, CHD tweeted, “Our mission hasn’t changed. The MMR vaccine is dangerous and has caused more deaths than measles,” a claim that is totally unsubstantiated. The next day, Kory returned for another CHD video claiming to have reviewed the medical records for the second case and, unsurprisingly, again maintained that the 8-year-old girl did not die from the measles. He said:
“This is just getting exhausting, this constant fear-mongering by the media. I’ve already lost so much trust in the institutions of society. But to see them rampage like this on inaccuracies and peddling falsehoods and just distortions, it’s terrible. It’s terrible for our health. They are scaring people into getting what I think is a very dangerous vaccine.”

(Katie Myers | BPR)This coverage is made possible through a partnership between BPR and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline transports natural gas through West Virginia and Virginia. But for 10 years, climate activists and worried locals opposed it, even locking themselves to equipment and camping in the pipeline’s path. Many were opposed specifically to the transportation of natural gas, which includes methane, a highly flammable fossil fuel with a large carbon footprint. A new graphic novel, Holler, released in May, tells the story.
Denali Sai Nalamalapu, a Southwest Virginia-based climate activist and illustrator, spoke with BPR on what this fight meant for people who were involved and what it means now. 
This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.
Tell us a little about yourself and why you were drawn to the Mountain Valley Pipeline to begin with?
I joined the pipeline fight to support, with communications and federal and congressional advocacy. As I started traveling more to the region, I got more connected to the community here that was fighting the pipeline and also to the mountains. I wanted to figure out different ways to tell the stories I was hearing, particularly stories of ordinary people who were just living their lives and then became pipeline resistors. And so I sat down with six people across the region that’s impacted by the pipeline in Central Appalachia, and the book came to life from there.
What did this pipeline mean, not only to the people in West Virginia that the pipeline directly impacted, but also to the broader Appalachian community? How did it unfold regionally?
When the pipeline was first proposed, it was part of and continues to be part of a centuries-long history of massive extractive fossil fuel projects coming to the region. 
Part of what made it unique though, is that it is such a huge project, being three 303 miles long, going through all of West Virginia, through Southwest Virginia, into Southern Virginia, with extensions that threaten communities in Northern North Carolina. And it’s methane gas, which is a highly flammable gas that’s also contributing to climate change.
It was such an intense, huge fight that came right after and during the fights against coal mining and specifically mountaintop removal in Central Appalachia. It did show up in this lineage of strong resistance in Appalachia that is very well known in this region, but continues to go overlooked outside of the region.

“Holler” is a graphic novel, which is a unique way to tell a character-driven story. Why did you choose the graphic novel format, and to explore the MVP through these six activists?
All of that thinking was part of, how do I tell a story of the Mountain Valley Pipeline Fight with the voices of the resistors uplifted? 
One of them is pretty well known. Her name’s Becky Crabtree, and she is known as the Grandma who locked herself to her Ford Pinto when her sheep farm was threatened by the pipeline.
And the other is a quieter resistor named Paula Mann, who is a photographer who used her skills to document the way the pipeline threatened the woods that seven generations of her family have lived in.
Part of who ended up being part of the book … were people who both had been part of the struggle and had been covered by the news, and who were the quieter resistors, and who were the younger resistors who were in college when they learned about the pipeline, and who were the people that were well into their 80s learning about it, and also diversity because I think central Appalachia gets thought of as this very white, very poor region that has no diversity. Oftentimes, the Monacan tribe and the other indigenous tribes in the Southeast don’t get recognized as tribes and people who are continuing to fight and protect this land.
The MVP ultimately was greenlit in 2024, and is continuing to make its way down through to North Carolina. Protesters may have the opportunity to carry these lessons forward. In 2020, the government approved an extension of the MVP into North Carolina called Southgate.
 Where does the pipeline fight go from here and what’s happening now?
It felt important to me that we did lose the fight, in a traditional way of deeming did you win or lose the pipeline fight, while also telling engaging and authentic stories of the community that was built through the pipeline fight and the people that were changed by the pipeline fight. 
And as we see the federal government in the U.S. and many powerful entities across the world not take climate change as seriously as we believe that they need to, we’re going to have to define winning with more nuance than, did you absolutely stop the project or not?

The state Senate unanimously approved House Bill 90 by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, without discussion Thursday. The proposal would ban companies such as Appointment Trader, Dorsia and ResX from arranging reservations through their platforms if they do not have explicit contracts with restaurants. 
Hebert’s bill is expected to become law with Gov. Jeff Landry’s signature, having received unanimous approval in every committee hearing and floor vote in both chambers, 
Reservation trading platforms allow diners with hard-to-get table reservations to sell them online in auction-style transactions similar to eBay. Prospective buyers can also use the platforms as a concierge service, offering a flat fee to anyone who can secure them a table at a particular establishment.

While the practice of paying for restaurant reservations is more common in places such as New York and Miami, the trading platforms have come under scrutiny in Louisiana since the Illuminator reported on high-dollar trades in New Orleans during Super Bowl weekend. 
The transactions included a $2,138 reservation for a table of four at Antoine’s.
In a previous interview, Hebert said some local eateries reported confusion over complaints from diners who bought reservations without realizing the restaurants weren’t the ones selling them. 
“We’re not talking about Chick-fil-A here,” Hebert said. “It’s a select group of restaurants they’re doing this to … They’re profiting off of a restaurant’s brand, and the restaurants don’t even know about it.”
Backed by the National Restaurant Association, versions of the legislation began popping up in state capitols last year. 
Reached after Hebert’s bill advanced Thursday, Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey said his small business is facing seemingly insurmountable odds. Only a few years old, his startup logged more than $6 million in trades over the past 12 months.  
“I’m weighing my options, but it certainly feels like a David versus Goliath situation,” Frey said.
At the center of the debate is a market space currently dominated by the booking platforms OpenTable and Resy, which operate under a very different revenue model than the nascent trading platforms. 
OpenTable makes money by charging restaurants a fee every time someone reserves a table through its app, while the trading apps charge diners a percentage of the winning bid price for each trade. 
If the newer trading platforms can secure partnerships with restaurants, they would pose a serious threat to the well-established booking apps. Restaurants would no longer have to pay the third-party booking platforms whenever diners make reservations and would actually make money every time someone books through a trading platform. 
Frey said he offers contracts to restaurants giving them an equal share of the winning bids for every reservation. It would give dining businesses a new revenue stream from something that currently costs them money, he said. 
However, Louisiana lawmakers don’t believe it’s a viable industry and see reservation trading as an opportunistic industry that is artificially inflating demand just to cash in on wealthy tourists. 
Hebert and his colleagues have argued that tables would be easy and free to reserve if software bots weren’t snapping them up from OpenTable and then listing them for sale on the trading apps. 
Frey disagreed with that assessment and said he doesn’t think technology could even do that.  
Large booking sites have several security layers, such as requiring personal phone numbers with text message verification, in order to make a reservation.    
The trading apps had no lobbyists or advocates speaking on their behalf against Hebert’s bill, so lawmakers have only heard one side of the argument. 
Hebert said his intent is not to end the practice of reservation trading but to simply give the restaurants back their right to control their own bookings.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Across the nation, law enforcement agencies are accessing Flock Automatic License Plate Reader (ALPR) camera databases, regardless of whether they have their own contract for the AI-powered system. Researchers from 404 Media published a data trove derived from Flock audits earlier this week. Although the audit data came from the Danville Police Department in Illinois, Wisconsin Examiner found that intelligence units within the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) also appear in the database.  
The audit data shows that last year on July 15 and Oct. 21, personnel from the Southeastern Threat Analysis Center (STAC) — a homeland security-focused arm of the MPD’s fusion center — conducted a total of three searches within Danville PD’s Flock network. STAC gathers and disseminates intelligence across eight counties in southeastern Wisconsin. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
MPD’s own Fusion Division is co-located with the STAC. Together the units operate a “real time event center,” a vast network of both city-owned and privately owned cameras and operate Milwaukee’s gunshot detection system known as Shotspotter. They also monitor social media and conduct various types of mobile phone-related investigations. STAC has also explored the use of drones, facial recognition technology and predictive intelligence.
MPD’s Flock searches were logged under the user name “D. Whi” from “Milwaukee WI PD – STAC”. In the dataset’s “reason” column, the searches were recorded as “HSI investigation” and “HSI vehicle loader.” Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) specialize in matters of immigration, illegal exporting, cyber crime and national security.
By tapping into Danville’s Flock data, according to the audit, STAC was able to access 4,893 Flock networks and an equal number of individual devices, such as cameras, for the July 15 search alone. The other two searches from October reached 5,425 Flock networks and devices and captured data from a one-month period. 
404 Media’s investigation focused on how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has accessed Flock databases nationwide, despite not having a contract with the company themselves, and how various agencies appeared to conduct immigration-related searches. Whereas many searches were logged as “immigration violation,” “ICE” or even “ICE ASSIST,” others only noted the involvement of HSI. 
In a statement sent Wednesday morning, an MPD spokesperson denied that STAC’s use of Danville PD’s Flock network was immigration-related. “Information regarding this investigation is classified and not available as it is ongoing,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to Wisconsin Examiner. “I can confirm it is related to a criminal investigation with HSI and not immigration related.” The spokesperson later added that this was a “HIDTA investigation,” referring to a federal task force linked to the federal High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program. 
MPD’s HIDTA units are attached to the department’s Special Investigations Division, a separate branch from the Fusion division and STAC. “The majority of HIDTA and STAC investigations are classified,” the spokesperson wrote in the statement. “Oftentimes, these investigations involved confidential informants and sometimes it could take years to resolve.”
Several police departments in Milwaukee County utilize Flock cameras. MPD entered into its contract in 2022. Over 1,300 registered cameras operate across the city as part of Community Connect, a program supported by the Milwaukee Police Foundation, according to the program’s web page, with nearly 900 “integrated” cameras which grant MPD real-time access.

Both the use of automatic license plate readers and MPD’s ability to participate in immigration enforcement are governed by specific policies. The department’s immigration policy, SOP-130, cautions that “proactive immigration enforcement by local police can be detrimental to our mission and policing philosophy when doing so deters some individuals from participating in their civic obligation to assist the police.” The policy limits MPD’s ability to assist ICE with detaining or gathering information about a person to “only when a judicial warrant is presented” and when the target is suspected of involvement in terrorism, espionage, a transnational criminal street gang, violent felony, sexual offense against a minor or was a previously deported felon. 
A curiously timed public hearing 
Privacy advocates have raised concerns and filed lawsuits over Flock’s ability to collect and store data without a warrant. The license plate reader policy – SOP 735 – allows personnel to access data stored “for the purposes of conducting crime trend analyses” but only when those activities are approved by a supervisor and are intended to “assist the agency in the performance of its duties.” 
MPD personnel may use Flock to “look for potentially suspicious activity or other anomalies that might be consistent with criminal or terrorist activity” and are not prohibited from “accessing and comparing personal identifying information of one or more individuals who are associated with a scanned vehicle as part of the process of analyzing stored non-alert data.” Automatic license plate reading technology captures information from any passing car. In some cases, investigators may also place specific vehicles on a Be On the Lookout (BOLO) list, also known as a “hot list”, which notifies law enforcement whenever a specific vehicle is seen by a license plate reader-equipped camera. 
A Thursday morning public hearing held by the city’s Finance and Personnel Committee considered whether more Flock cameras should be added to Milwaukee’s already existing network. Ald. Scott Spiker spoke in support of the cameras, and said he worked to install license plate readers in his own district. Spiker described having discussions with local business district leaders and MPD’s fusion center, which resulted in cameras being deployed on 27th Street. “Don’t ask me where, because I won’t tell you,” said Spiker, adding that the cameras “serve a variety of purposes” from combating car theft to aiding Amber and Silver Alerts.

“There’s going to a broader question, which I imagine will be a subject of the public testimony, however, and I’m fine hearing it, but ultimately there’s going to be a discussion to be had in the city of anything that smacks of surveillance software, and what sort of oversight is provided, and should be provided,” said Spiker. He added that such a discussion “will be had in full in Public Safety” and that although he welcomed public testimony, the committee was there to discuss approving a contract, and not concerns over surveillance. 
“The camera’s already in use by MPD, and in use by our parking checkers,” said Spiker. “When they do night parking enforcement, they use ALPR’s. When they do zoning enforcement during the day, they use ALPR’s. So these are already in use. They have no facial recognition or any of the stuff that’s been in the news. But it is a legitimate question to ask what degree of surveillance of any sort, given the national context, do we want to have oversight over?” 
Spiker said that there’s a “big debate” about surveillance but that “we can’t sort that out today.” 
Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin, complained that the public had not been alerted ahead of time about the discussion of the Flock contract. “I’ve been checking daily and the documents in this file and the text of the resolution weren’t posted until yesterday [Wednesday] afternoon,” said Merkwae. “So I think for an item that has significant implications for the civil liberties of Milwaukeeans, particularly the most vulnerable resident, that’s concerning.”

The agenda had been out for over a week, and was amended a couple of days before the hearing, Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic later explained. 
Merkwae said, “We know that ICE has gained access to troves of data from sanctuary cities to aid in its raids and immigration enforcement actions, including data from the vast network of license plate readers across the country.” She cited a 404 Media investigation earlier this month, which found that Flock is building a massive people look-up tool which pulls in different forms of data, including license plate reader data, “in order to track specific individuals without a warrant.” 
Merkwae also referenced 404 Media’s findings this week revealing immigration-related look-ups, as well as the classified investigation that involved MPD’s intelligence units. The advocacy director also questioned what MPD’s policies mean in practice when federal or out-of-state law enforcement want to access its Flock databases. 
“If law enforcement told us that they wanted to put a tracking device on every single car in the country so that we know where every car is every single moment of the day, and we’re going to build a database of all those locations run by an unaccountable private company, and accessible to every law enforcement agency across the country without needing any type of a warrant, I think we would be alarmed and we would have some follow-up questions,” said Merkwae. “So at the end of the day, we think the public deserves to know how it is being surveilled and the common council deserves to know the answers to some pretty basic questions before approving contracts for surveillance technology that’s deployed without a warrant.”
In 2023, Fox 6 published a map of Flock cameras operated by MPD. The map, broken up by aldermadic district, shows a large cluster of cameras located on the North Side around District 7, as well as a cluster on the South Side around District 8. Smaller clusters of cameras were located on the East, far Southwest Side and Northwest Side of the city.

After Merkwae testified, Spiker raised a question about whether public testimony should continue, given open meetings laws. A lengthy discussion followed about which issues and topics may be discussed in the hearing by committee members, which halted public testimony for over 20 minutes as alders heard from city attorneys and MPD. Ald. Miele Coggs said hearing the public’s concerns before a contract is approved for surveillance technology was important. Ald. Dimitrijevic also stressed that public comment was an important step, saying that the committee would not go into closed session to discuss the Flock contract before the public finished speaking, or otherwise limit public testimony. 
When public testimony continued, Milwaukee residents shared further concerns about the technology. Ron Jansen said that the city has seen a surge of surveillance gear used by MPD. “Between the growth of a fascist regime in Washington …  and our own militarized and violent police force here in Milwaukee, it’s clear that the last thing we need is more ways for police to track us,” Jansen said. He added that Flock networks are capable of tracking and cataloging “people’s every movement throughout a given day” even if they’re not the target of an investigation.
  Ald. Scott Spiker (City of Milwaukee)
Other residents, including locals from Spiker’s district and representatives from the court diversion non-profit program JusticePoint, also spoke against Flock’s expansion. Tara Cavazos, executive director of the South 27th Street Business District, said Flock cameras had made her area safer. “We are the initiators of these three additions to the Flock network,” said Cavazos. “And we donated the funds for two years of use of these Flock cameras. So they’re not coming from MPD’s budget, it’s coming out of our budgets. These Flocks are not going to be placed in a neighborhood, it’s not specific to any vulnerable communities, they are in business districts on state and county highways.” 
Cavazos said that since Flocks have been deployed, car thefts declined “significantly on the south end of our corridor, where the border between Milwaukee and Greenfield is,” and that “we’ve caught a homicide suspect.” Leif Otteson, an executive director of two business districts, said that he hears from people who want more surveillance. Otteson recalled working to expand the city’s ring camera network, which STAC and other parts of MPD’s fusion center have access to. Otteson has talked with people who want cameras in their community gardens and other areas. “I just want to make that clear, that people like myself are getting those requests,” said Otteson. 
Once public testimony concluded, the committee went into closed session for over an hour. The discussion pertained to an unspecified “non-standard” provision in the Flock contract, which had been raised by the city attorney’s office. When the committee returned to open session, they voted 4-1 to hold the file due to legal concerns with the contract until the next committee meeting on June 18.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Few Trump administration agencies are so out of control as Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
ICE in recent months has disappeared people from American communities, a hallmark of unaccountable authoritarianism. The agency releases scant information to the public about its activities, and it withholds information even in court proceedings. Its agents wield the awesome power to deprive people of their liberty, and they’ve used that power to deposit hundreds of people in a brutal foreign prison, likely for life.
Demand for oversight has rarely been so great, and no tool of ICE oversight should be left unused.
Members of Congress have at least one method by which to oversee the agency — they can show up at ICE detention centers unannounced and perform inspections. But U.S. representatives and senators in Colorado exercise this authority too infrequently.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
ICE this year has undertaken aggressive immigration enforcement efforts as part of President Donald Trump’s plan for mass deportations. In Colorado, which Trump made a particular focus of his anti-immigration program, the agency has undertaken several raids and other operations that have resulted in scores of people being held at its detention center in Aurora, operated by private prison company the GEO Group.
People there are often denied constitutionally guaranteed due process, targeted for their exercise of First Amendment rights, and held without being charged with a crime, according to court documents and immigration advocates. About 12 detainees were removed from the Aurora facility to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador.
Federal authorities have gone about this business with essentially no transparency. That’s where oversight comes in.
In 2019, U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, tried to inspect the ICE facility after learning about poor health conditions there. He was denied entry, prompting him to pursue on-site oversight authority, which he helped secure in law. Members of Congress, according to language that is included annually in appropriations legislation, now have the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits at Department of Homeland Security facilities.
This was no empty gesture. Crow has routinely invoked the authority ever since, and he posts to his website reports about visits to the detention center in Aurora. His office has already completed two oversight visits this month.
This is the same authority by which three U.S. representatives from New Jersey recently tried to conduct oversight at an ICE facility in that state. They were denied entry, and the Trump administration charged one of the lawmakers with a crime.
But ICE’s refusal to respect oversight authority is no cause to idle it. It’s reason to assert it to its fullest extent.
Crow should not be alone in conducting inspections in Aurora. Democratic U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado should also show up. Hickenlooper has expressed anger over the Trump administration’s lawless approach to immigration enforcement, even suggesting in April that “the country’s going to rise up” in response. But to a reporter’s question about what senators like him could do, he said, “You want me to get my pitchfork?”
No. But lawmakers can get inside a facility where Colorado residents, snatched off the streets by the federal government, now face unconstitutional removal to prisons run by foreign dictators, and at least demonstrate to ICE and the people of Colorado that they’ve got their eye on MAGA malfeasance in Denver’s backyard.
Other members of the U.S. House from Colorado can also exercise oversight of ICE. The detention center in Aurora sits in Crow’s district, and territorial deference is doubtless a factor, especially among fellow Democrats. But Crow could arrange a multimember visit. The detention center in New Jersey sits in McIver’s district, and two other members of Congress from neighboring districts had arrived to inspect the facility with McIver when they were denied entry. Strength in numbers sends a message that the members will do everything they can to hold an outpost of authoritarianism in Colorado to account.
A member of Hickenlooper’s staff accompanied a Crow staff member during one inspection in March. In response to questions from Newsline about whether they’d visited the Aurora facility, the six Democratic members of the Colorado congressional delegation — Bennet, Hickenlooper, Crow and Reps. Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse and Brittany Pettersen — responded in a joint statement: “Oversight is a key part of our jobs, and a responsibility we don’t take lightly. The Trump Administration’s recent attempts to intimidate Members of Congress from conducting oversight of ICE detention facilities are alarming — and we will not back down. We are fully committed to providing the necessary oversight and transparency of the GEO ICE facility in Aurora to ensure these facilities are run in full accordance with the law, and our offices will continue to perform the critical casework to ensure detainees are treated fairly.”
The oversight authority alone won’t enable members of Congress to stop the abuses that ICE commits in Aurora. Crow helped establish the authority at a time when immigration advocates were most concerned about health conditions, not cancellation of basic rights. No facility walk-through can remedy the profound injustices at work there.
But at a time when Democrats seem overwhelmed and impotent as the Trump administration dismantles constitutional order, every available counterweight should be applied with maximum force.

Participants in the Make MI Home program will receive free access to Michigan’s state parks, opportunities to connect with others through curated events and discounts at various local attractions and businesses.
Two years after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the creation of Chief Growth Officer Hilary Doe’s position in her Mackinac Policy Conference keynote, Doe said the state is beginning to trend in the right direction, with Detroit and Flint both showing population growth for the first time in several years.
“Every year, there are more people moving to Michigan and fewer moving out than there were in the year before,” Doe said.
But she said there is still work to do to ensure those trends continue, which is why the state announced more than $700,000 of grant funding for five programs aimed at reversing Michigan’s population decline.
Make MI Home offers grants to programs throughout the state to help people with things like housing and relocation support, access to coworking spaces and more.
Among the grant recipients is the City of Detroit, which will receive $210,000 to launch the Detroit Tech Fellowship Program, which will target recent graduates from Michigan universities to scale their startups in Michigan, providing access to coworking space, housing support, and cohort events to network and collaborate with peers and local entrepreneurs.
“What we’re talking about today is making it easier for people to say yes to living in Michigan,” Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist said.
Gilchrist said he understands the need for the funding as someone who was born and raised in Michigan but left the state to pursue his career after graduating college.
“We grow our population one decision at a time, one person deciding where they’re going to take their next step in life, where they’re going to build their next chapter, where they’re going to make their family and their future and their career real,” Gilchrist said.

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s colleges and universities could lose millions of dollars and thousands of jobs after the federal government froze international student visa interviews on Tuesday, mounted efforts to require all foreign students to undergo social media vetting and announced plans to “aggressively revoke” Chinese students’ visas. 
The actions, spearheaded by Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the behest of President Donald Trump’s administration, are likely to disrupt international students considering attending any of the schools in the commonwealth. Over 21,000 international students were enrolled at Virginia colleges and universities in the 2023-2024 academic year, according to the National Association of Foreign Advisors’ Association of International Educators. 
International students contributed $807.2 million to Virginia’s higher learning institutions in the same period, NAFSA reported in its latest data.
Tim Gibson, president of the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University Professors, said the student visa interview pause and other changes could negatively impact international students, who have proven to make positive contributions to U.S. universities and the commonwealth, and deter international students from pursuing an education in America, including Virginia.
“They just want to learn and they come here because they want to learn from us,” Gibson said, “and they want to learn at American universities because American universities have a stellar reputation around the world for academic freedom, for having resources to support excellent undergraduate and graduate instruction, and for having the kind of freedom of an openness to explore the questions you want to explore and to make the contributions you want to make.”
George Mason University, located in Fairfax County in Northern Virginia, was the highest recipient of funding from international students, receiving $207.5 million, ahead of Virginia Tech, the University of Virginia, VCU, and Northern Virginia Community College, which rounded out the top five institutions in the commonwealth with the most financial benefit from foreign students during the 2023-24 school year.
Student visas are essential for international students to legally enter, reside, and study in the United States, including at institutions in Virginia, which, if foreign students stop attending, could face financial challenges since students from outside the U.S. pay higher tuition fees compared to in-state students.
Since Tuesday, the administration has directed U.S. embassies and consulates, who are responsible for issuing visas, to suspend new visa interviews for international students seeking to study in the U.S. until further guidance is provided.
The move comes after the administration accused some institutions, including Harvard University, of allowing antisemitism on campus. The administration is attempting to revoke Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which enables the university to enroll international students. A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to do so, after Harvard filed a lawsuit to retain the right to admit international students.
On Wednesday, Rubio announced the State Department along with the Department of Homeland Security will be revoking visas for Chinese students, including those with “connections” to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in “critical fields.” The agencies will be revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong, Rubio’s statement read.
Gibson said the announcement is concerning for many students, especially graduate students, because they often bring their families who attend daycares and schools in the commonwealth.
“Now they’re threatened with deportation for no reason other than paranoia, racism, and xenophobia,” Gibson said. “Even just making a threat has irreparably harmed the international reputation of our universities and colleges.”
In a statement on Tuesday, NAFSA said the latest action by the Trump administration is another “misguided” and “deeply troubling attack” against international students, who are facing arrests, visa revocations and threats to their ability to enroll in certain U.S. institutions.
The association said it’s also a waste of taxpayer funding to screen students who are already subject to extensive background checks, compared to business visitors and tourists.
“If the administration believes enhanced scrutiny is necessary, it should be applied uniformly — not selectively to students who have long contributed to American classrooms, communities, and cutting-edge research,” a NAFSA representative said. “Moreover, there is no urgent justification to halt visa appointments while internal policy updates are considered. This only adds unnecessary delays, fuels uncertainty, and damages our reputation as a welcoming destination for global talent.”
This week’s actions aren’t the first issues concerning international students the Trump administration has weighed in on. 
In January, the administration directed U.S. diplomats and consulates to refer certain student and exchange visitor visa applicants to its fraud prevention unit for mandatory social media checks, through two executive orders focused on protecting the country from foreign threats and combating antisemitism.

The temperature of water in the Chesapeake Bay naturally fluctuates each year, tied to weather patterns and ecosystem changes across the bay’s massive, 64,000-square-mile watershed.
But a new study led by the University of Maryland is yet another confirmation of what scientists have reported for years: The bay is steadily warming and seeing a growing number of extreme heat incidents known as marine heat waves.
The frequency of underwater heat waves in the bay doubled over the past 20 years, researchers say in the paper published this week in a scientific journal called Estuaries and Coasts.
Marine heat waves refer to stretches of days or weeks with unusually hot water temperatures. On average, the bay annually experiences about 25 days of extreme heat, according to the new study.
Jacob Wenegrat, an assistant oceanography professor and part of the research team, said the increase is likely due to the bay’s slow warming over time.
That’s driven by changing climate conditions worldwide that show no signs of slowing down. The ocean absorbs 90% of the excess heat from global warming.
“If you project out to the end of the century, what we would call a heat wave now might just be sort of standard conditions,” Wenegrat said.
The group analyzed temperature data from 2003 to 2022 from a variety of satellites and validated it with long-term data collected by buoys that have sensors throughout the bay.
The Chesapeake is particularly ripe for research because it has a uniquely extensive dataset from decades of monitoring by federal and state agencies, Wenegrat said.
The researchers noticed significant differences between the upper and lower sections of the bay.
The area north of the Potomac River saw more frequent heat waves, but for shorter durations. In the lower part including Virginia, there were fewer heat waves but they lasted longer.
Wenegrat said it’s not yet clear what leads to the variability.
Officials are concerned about hotter water because it can kill off seagrass, which is a sort of “nursery” for other marine life, causing ripple effects including fewer rockfish and blue crabs for local fisheries.
Higher temperatures are also known to lessen the amount of oxygen in the water, which can suffocate animals and help spur the growth of harmful algae.
Satellite data only captures temperature at the top of the water, “a very surface snapshot,” Wenegrat said.
Research by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science last year aimed to get more information from farther down the water column, where it’s harder for heat to penetrate. Their study found that summer heat waves stay closer to the surface, while winter temperature increases go “all the way down to the bottom.”
Wenegrat said he’s excited by the potential to combine both types of data for a fuller picture of what’s happening in the bay. He hopes the growing sources of information help local officials take action to prepare.
“Once you have the conditions for a marine heat wave in place, there’s not a lot we can do directly to stop it,” Wenegrat said. “But there is a lot that can be done from a management perspective.”
That includes helping protect marine species, setting up an early warning system and addressing potential economic impacts to industries that rely on the water.

(Photo by Cappi Thompson/Getty Images)Every fall, winter ticks in New England sit on shrubs or other plants waiting for a large animal to pass by so they can latch on and begin sucking out blood. This has a huge impact on the area’s moose, wildlife biologists say.
“They basically become zombies and die,” Eric Orff, a New Hampshire-based wildlife biologist, said. “We have zombie moose.”
According to estimates from New Hampshire Fish and Game, the Granite State’s moose population peaked in the late 1990s at around 7,000 to 8,000 moose. It has since declined to roughly 3,000 to 4,000.
Most tick species move from host to host frequently, but winter ticks find a moose, deer, or other animal around November and extract their blood for the entirety of winter. And it’s not just one or a couple ticks on each host. Rather, hundreds or thousands of ticks often latch onto a host. This is a process called questing and it has a huge effect on moose, particularly calves.
“April is the month of death for calves,” Orff, who works as a field biologist at the National Wildlife Federation and serves as vice president of the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation, said. “The adult ticks are feeding one more time before they fall off and they basically drain the moose’s supply of blood.”
Around April, the female ticks fall off their hosts to lay their eggs. If they land on snow as opposed to dry land, the eggs are less fruitful. However, as climate change represses winter weather, tick populations have boomed.
“Over the last 20 years, instead of one winter out of six or eight or 10 being truncated, now, a majority of them are,” Orff said. “So what has been found in more recent moose studies, including those done in New Hampshire and in Maine and Vermont the last two decades, is that it really significantly impacts the moose calves born that previous spring.”
While adult moose are better able to fend off the tick infestations, he said, 70% of calves don’t make it to 1 year old. And this also affects adult female moose. Orff, who has been studying moose and other wildlife for decades, said that when he and his colleagues began this research in the 1980s, nearly all older female moose gave birth to two calves. Now, he said, less than half the females even become pregnant. He said this is a result of being underweight from the ticks, but also because climate change is making summers warmer, which results in them eating less. Underweight moose are less likely to give birth.
“It’s really a double whammy,” he said.
A third factor, he said, is that south of the White Mountains brain worms have proliferated. While moose populations have plummeted, white-tail deer populations have nearly tripled from about 40,000 in the early 1980s to around 100,000 to 120,000 in the southern half of the state due to milder winters, he said. Brain worms are common in deer, and while those brain worms don’t harm the deer, they can be fatal to moose.
Orff noted the economic costs of lower moose populations. He said people used to travel to the North Country specifically to see the moose.
“Moose viewing in New Hampshire for a period of years was a $10-million-a-year industry,” he said. “I don’t know if there’s any companies that still do it. I think there are. But you used to be able to go out and, in a night, see a dozen or a half dozen moose at least. Now they may go several hours and see no moose.”
These die-offs also cause ecological issues. Henry Jones, moose project leader for Fish and Game, said moose carcasses serve as a food source for scavengers, which are seeing rising numbers in the wake of this population collapse. Jones said the past two years have been particularly severe for tick infestations.
To address this, the state is issuing more hunting permits. Jones said tick populations rise when the moose population has high density. By killing off moose, the survivors fare better, he said. The state is also working with the University of New Hampshire to study the conditions in which ticks proliferate best. Jones said this is all about “keeping them from getting really high density and causing this kind of cyclic relationship of lots of tick mortality.”
However, the hunting strategy still results in dead moose and low populations. Orff noted the conundrum.
“I guess that’s the debate,” Orff said. “Is it better to have far fewer moose and less sickly moose? … Baby moose who drop dead from no blood in April or taking some of them out that will be utilized by hunters eating them?”
Jones said the state is acting based on the wishes of citizens.
“We did a public survey to understand what the residents want with the moose population in 2024,” Jones said. “People want there to be the same or more moose, but they don’t want there to be more moose if they’re unhealthy.”
Still, Orff said none of these are a true solution to the overall problem. Moose will continue dying, he said, until we put an end to humans’ warming of the planet.

(Photo by Will Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)In April, the New Hampshire House passed a budget that eliminated a number of state boards, including the Commission for Human Rights, the Housing Appeals Board, the Commission on Aging, and the State Council on the Arts. 
This month, Senate Republicans are moving to save those entities. But each could look slightly different moving forward. 
In a series of votes, the Senate Finance Committee gave initial approval to amendments that would reverse the cuts — with conditions. Those amendments must be approved by the committee again next week, and then by the full Senate on June 5.
Here’s what the Senate has proposed.
A business tax credit to fund the arts
The House budget had eliminated the Arts Division of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, including the New Hampshire Council on the Arts. That division had received about $1.7 million in state funding, and $2 million in federal funding. 
The Senate’s proposed amendment, passed Thursday, would restore the division, but change how it is funded. Rather than receiving general fund dollars, businesses could donate to the Granite Patron of the Arts Fund, and receive 50% of that donation as a credit against the business profits tax. The tax credit could give out a maximum of $350,000 a year, which would translate to a maximum potential budget of $1.4 million over two years for the arts fund.
The amendment is a shift in approach for Sen. Tim Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, who earlier proposed reducing funding for the Arts Division to $1.
“My inbox was filled when I allocated $1 for the Council on the Arts, and I took that to heart and I made changes,” he said. “This will allow for a tax break system — it will still allow them to collect donations, but make it more incentivized by allowing those corporate donations or private donations.” 
Democratic Sen. David Watters, of Dover, called the compromise “very helpful.”
“I think that making sure … that we have the core operations covered, so that there can be somebody who actually goes out and tries to sell these tax credits, that is good, and I think that will keep the office functioning,” he said.
A position cut for the Housing Appeals Board
The Senate restored funding to the Housing Appeals Board, which is designed to give developers and residents an alternative to the state court system to resolve conflicts with local zoning and planning boards. The House had cut that panel entirely, which costs $560,864 over two years. 
But Senate Finance Chairman James Gray said the committee would recommend eliminating a position within that board, and would attach the board to the state’s Board of Tax and Land Appeals, which handles disputes over state and local taxes as well as property assessments. 
Gray said the attachment was designed to save on personnel costs to run both boards. 
Aging commission restored; Commission for Human Rights to receive more scrutiny
The Senate Finance Committee recommended reviving the Commission for Human Rights, a panel designed to investigate discrimination complaints and pass them on to the Attorney General’s Office for potential prosecution under state anti-discrimination statutes. The House had abolished the commission, but the Senate restored it, at a cost of $2.7 million over two years. 
But another Senate amendment would require the Department of Justice’s civil rights unit to oversee the commission. The amendment would also mandate that the chairperson of the commission be a licensed attorney in the state. 
The committee also proposed restoring funding to the State Commission on Aging, at $150,000 per year. Currently, that is funded at $280,432 per year; the House had voted to eliminate the commission. The commission, established in 2019, is charged with making recommendations on how the state can support older residents and increase the health care workforce for direct care. 
Senators revise expected revenues higher
The votes this week came as the Finance Committee decided to follow a rosier outlook for revenues the next two years. On Wednesday, Lang, who is also the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Department of Revenue Administration Commissioner Lindsey Stepp had recommended new projections for the state’s business profits tax, meals and rooms tax, and real estate transfer tax. 
The new projections would increase business tax revenues by $75 million over the biennium; the meals and rooms tax by $27.8 million; and the real estate transfer tax by $5 million. 
Lang cited analyses from Morningstar and Kiplinger, two research firms, that suggested New Hampshire could benefit from uncertain economic conditions by attracting people seeking to save money or take local vacations. 
Sen. Dan Innis, a Bradford Republican, backed up Lang’s analysis, arguing he believes revenues will come in even stronger than Lang’s proposed increase. 
But a Democratic senator, Cindy Rosenwald of Nashua, said she disagrees with the move to increase projected business tax collections. Rosenwald said she had her own conversation with Stepp, and had received a more mixed assessment of businesses.
“If the tariff stuff doesn’t calm down, that’s going to lead to more business uncertainty, but if the extension of the federal tax cuts gets made (in Congress), businesses will like that, because they like certainty,” Rosenwald said. “…So I’m not comfortable with increasing the business tax rates.”
Adopting those new projections will allow the Senate to plan for nearly $108 million more in revenue over the next two years, which could help it ease some cuts imposed by the House. The committee voted to approve the new revenue figures on party lines, 5-2. 
Affordable housing money increase blocked
The committee voted on Wednesday against a proposal to increase the amount of money transferred to the state’s affordable housing fund from $5 million to $7 million. That money comes out of the state’s real estate transfer tax. 
Watters argued that the fund should be increased to allow more development because the current amount is not enough. Initially, Democrats and affordable housing advocates had pushed for the annual transfers to the fund to be doubled, to $10 million.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5293785-Senate-Finance-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 06:01:00.128710

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Times are tough for Arkansas farmers, who like many of their counterparts across the country, are dealing with challenges such as high input costs and low commodity prices for crops. Weather and pests also pose issues, but Jacob Rowell of Kings River Produce said the bigger problem is finding a market for produce once you grow it. 
“I can’t explain as a farmer how much time I had to spend marketing,” Rowell said. “Finding a market for your product is 75% of the battle, the other 25 percent’s growing it. You can figure out how to grow it, but it don’t do you no good to have 10,000 pounds of produce if you ain’t got nowhere to go with it.”  
It was “a game-changer” for the 29-year-old farmer when he began working with Spring Creek Food Hub. The nonprofit connects local farmers to wholesale institutions, specifically nonprofits like schools, hospitals and community health care clinics, Director of Operations Nena Hammer said.
Spring Creek provides technical assistance and equipment to Rowell, who said he’s been growing root crops, like carrots, on his farm near Eureka Springs and selling them to the food hub, which has distributed the produce to local schools. 
“It’s awesome. It really is awesome. I could see this thing growing the food community here in this part of the state tremendously,” he said. “I would like to see it grow where it’s reaching all corners of the state.”
Spring Creek works with about 65 farms across Arkansas, but could potentially reach more at its new home inside the new Market Center of the Ozarks, which celebrated its grand opening in downtown Springdale Thursday. 
The 45,000-square-foot food hub is designed to support local farmers and food entrepreneurs by providing resources like crop aggregation, certified commercial kitchens, cold storage and technical assistance to help strengthen Northwest Arkansas’ local food system, according to a press release. 
The $31 million facility is part of the Northwest Arkansas Food Systems initiative launched by the Walton Family Foundation in 2020. Plans for the Market Center of the Ozarks were announced in 2022.

Emily English, the foundation’s senior program officer for NWA Food Systems and director for Market Center of the Ozarks, told guests at the grand opening that the center will help shape the future of local food in Northwest Arkansas. 
“The investment in Market Center of the Ozarks was never about creating a standalone project,” English said. “It was about building the missing infrastructure that enables our community partners to do what they do best.”
In addition to Spring Creek, the new facility will also house the Arkansas Food Innovation Center at the Market Center of the Ozarks. An initiative of the University of Arkansas’ Division of Agriculture, the AFIC at MCO supports local entrepreneurs by offering a shared-use commercial kitchen, food processing and bottling capabilities and technical support.
Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman said the facility will help Arkansas consumers more readily access food that’s grown and raised by local producers. 
“As chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I’ve met with farmers and ranchers and producers from across the state who are eager to sell their products in their communities and explore new ways to sell directly to consumers,” Boozman said. “It makes all the sense in the world to connect the food that is grown and raised here to families and entrepreneurs in the region so they can have access to fresh food while supporting their hardworking neighbors.”

Boozman said he’s confident the new facility will serve as a model for other regions of the country looking for ways to support local farmers and food entrepreneurs. 
“You can’t just keep doing the same thing,” he said. “You have to figure new and innovative ways to go about solving a problem, and so hopefully this will be a great example, not only for the state of Arkansas but for the rest of the country as we move forward.”
Solutions for supporting farmers are of particular importance in Arkansas where agriculture generates a $24 billion economic impact annually and is the state’s largest industry. Hunger is also a problem for the Natural State, which at a rate of 19%, has the highest prevalence of food insecurity in the nation, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released last year.
“Market Center of the Ozarks is just one piece of a much larger puzzle,” English said. “It represents what’s possible when we invest not just in buildings but in people — in the farmers growing our food, the entrepreneurs launching new ideas and the organizations working every day to feed our families. Together we’re building a more connected, resilient local food system.”

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
New rules protect pregnant workers, but red states sue over abortion provisions

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

No one ever said our state prisons would or should be cushy places to live and work. But neither should they be decrepit dumps in which an underpaid and understaffed workforce struggles to cope with an inmate population that is at once aging and unhealthy, and increasingly hopeless and prone to violence.
Unfortunately, as a recent legislative hearing made clear, that’s pretty much where things stand today.
As Department of Adult Correction secretary Leslie Dismukes told lawmakers, thanks largely to low pay and lousy working conditions, at least 13 prisons have an employee vacancy rate of over 50%.
Meanwhile, the system now has a running tab of 1.4 billion dollars in deferred maintenance. Indeed, fire suppression systems are outdated or completely inoperable in 23 prisons and several lack air conditioning – a fact that guarantees more illness and violence.
The bottom line: As with so many other problems plaguing state government, the solution to this crisis is no mystery—lawmakers simply must appropriate better funding. And their ongoing failure to do so is inexcusable.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.

After President Trump took office, his administration quickly issued guidance giving Immigration and Customs Enforcement the greenlight to make arrests in or near courthouses.
In the months since, there have been several highly publicized arrests at courthouses around the country. In one instance FBI agents even arrested a Wisconsin judge, alleging she obstructed an immigration arrest. Judge Hannah Dugan has filed a motion in federal court to have her charges dismissed.
Franklin County’s rules prohibit any civil arrest without a judicial warrant in the courthouse itself or on the sidewalk and entryways. ICE agents typically use an administrative warrant signed by an agency official rather than a judge.
The rules also prohibit the execution of a judicial warrant in a courtroom unless the judge agrees to allow it in writing, and restricts court staff from requesting or sharing information about a person’s immigration status.
In a press release, the court emphasized its responsibility to ensure due process for the public at large.
“That mission is jeopardized when victims, witnesses, and defendants are afraid to come to the courthouse to testify and participate in ongoing cases, fearing civil arrest and deportation from courthouse grounds,” the release stated.
People deciding not to show up, the court argued, undermines the fairness of trials “for citizens and non-citizens alike.”

Senate bill 172
State Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, believes the court overstepped its authority. Her proposal “specifies that persons who are unlawfully present in the United States are not privileged from arrest.”
State law already bars civil, but not criminal, arrest in several circumstances. You can’t get arrested going to the polls on Election Day, on the Fourth of July, on Sundays generally, or at a place of worship on the traditional day of worship.
Huge majorities support due process for migrants. They haven’t always gotten it in Ohio

The same privileges apply to court. The parties to a case, witnesses, jurors, and court officials, can’t be arrested for civil violations at, or on the way to and from court — a point cited in the local rules. But Roegner’s proposal would remove those privileges for undocumented individuals, and she said it was “drafted in response” to Franklin County’s changes.
“Senate Bill 172 would provide much needed support for federal immigration authorities,” she argued, “by requiring state and local public offices and public officials to allow the arrest or detention of any person who is suspected of being in the United States illegally for that person’s removal or for other immigration related purposes.”
The proposal also prohibits any public office in Ohio from enforcing rules that bar cooperation with immigration authorities.
How wide a net?
State Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, quipped that it’s “amazing thing that we would even have to do this.”  But the scope of Roegner’s proposal gave others pause, particularly in the context of the Trump administration’s recent track record with immigration enforcement.
Up until the first Trump administration, immigration authorities generally avoided places like courts, schools, hospitals and churches. But in 2018, an ICE directive laid out a policy that increased courthouse arrests substantially.
Trump campaigned for his second term promising mass deportations, and his administration has tried to fast-track those removals at the expense of due process. Last week a federal judge in Boston ruled a deportation flight to South Sudan violated his previous court order.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the administration could not deport a group of more than 170 Venezuelans with just 24 hours’ notice. In its ruling, the court pointed to a different, highly publicized case in which Kilmar Abrego Garcia was accidentally deported to El Salvador.

“Had the detainees been removed from the United States to the custody of a foreign sovereign,” the majority wrote, “the government may have argued, as it has previously argued, that no U.S. court had jurisdiction to order relief.”
State Sen. Casey Weinstein, D-Hudson, said he understood Roegner’s concern about illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. But he expressed doubts about giving free rein to officers seeking someone only suspected of being in the U.S. unlawfully.
“With some of the stories that have come out about immigrants who have been wrongfully detained or even wrongfully renditioned out of the country, I was just curious what your thoughts are on protections for legal residents — legal immigrants — who may feel concerned that they could be wrongfully targeted in this?” he asked.
Roegner said the U.S. is a country of immigrants and pointed to her own mother immigrating to the country from Finland. But she insisted “we’re also a country of laws,” and if someone is here legally “they would really have nothing to fear.”
“So yeah, will mistakes happen? Probably, yes, they happen all the time,” Roegner said. “But they can be cleared. They can say, ‘yep, no, I’m a legal immigrant, and here’s my paperwork,’ and they can prove that they’re here rightfully.”

Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) outlines a joint resolution for Pride Month, (Screenshot/WisEye)Wisconsin Democratic lawmakers are circulating four draft bills and two joint resolutions to address issues of discrimination against members of the lesbian, gay, trans and queer community.
The package was announced just before  Pride Month begins on June 1.
“We celebrate the history of the LGBTQ+ movement and the future of our population, and I can’t think of a more important time to do that,” said Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire), at a Capitol press conference Thursday. “Meanwhile in Washington the Trump administration and Republicans here in Wisconsin are engaging in rhetoric and political activity that seeks to erase LGBTQ+ people and target us …  the goal in that rhetoric and in that movement is to make us feel alone.”
Embracing diversity and joining with  allies give the community strength, Phelps said.
“Everybody who is not themselves a member of the LGBTQ+ community knows and loves at least one person in the community. And I think when they shut out all the noise and look inside, they know that they want the best for that person or those people,” Phelps said.
In addition to a joint resolution embracing Pride Month, the Equality Agenda legislation includes measures to:

Update various Wisconsin laws pertaining to married couples, including laws on adoption and on in vitro fertilization, to ensure they apply to same-sex couples.
Prohibit “conversion therapy” aimed at changing a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity and subjecting licensed professionals who practice it to professional discipline.
Bar the use of a “gay or trans panic” as a defense by persons accused of crimes.
Provide grants for training school counselors and social workers on LGBTQ+ rights.

Also part of the package is a proposed amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution that would repeal the 2006 amendment declaring marriage to be only between one man and one woman.
The amendment preventing the state from legally recognizing same-sex marriages remains on the books although it was overridden by the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage across the country.
“With the 20th anniversary of Wisconsin’s constitutional amendment that banned marriage equality coming up next year,” said Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit), chair of the Legislature’s LGBTQ+ Caucus. “It is long past time to give voters the chance to remove that discriminatory language from our constitution.”

File photo from MaxPixels.net.Federal officials are raising questions about exploding drug discounts under a program meant to fund services for low-income patients, and Ohio’s Cleveland Clinic is at the center of some of them. 
Over a 38-month period ending in June 2023, the massive nonprofit hospital received nearly $1 billion from the program. However, the clinic didn’t cut drug prices for any of its low-income patients, instead plowing the money into its general budget.
Officials at the clinic told congressional investigators that they used the money in other ways to help poor patients. Yet in 2023, the nonprofit hospital had enough money to pay 22 of its executives more than $1 million and another 30 over $500,000 — and still finish the year with nearly $1 billion in “net income.” A private business would call that “profit.”
For its part, the clinic pointed out that its operating income was much smaller than that, and that it spent almost as much on free or discounted care in 2023.
Dramatic expansion
Cleveland Clinic was one of two hospitals to come under scrutiny as part of a U.S. Senate investigation of a drug-discounting program known as 340B. 
It requires drugmakers who want to sell their products to Medicaid patients to also sell them to qualifying hospitals and clinics at deep, legally defined discounts. The hospitals and clinics then sell them at much higher prices and pocket the difference — notionally, to provide care to people who can’t afford it.
When it was created in 1992, 340B was intended to free up money and make federal resources go further for providers who cared for a heavy mix of low-income and underinsured patients. But after the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 and the 340B rules were changed, the amount of discounts provided under the program exploded — from $5 billion a year to nearly $67 billion in 2023.
That’s not free money, and the discounts to 340B providers are made up by other payers — including the poor, said Antonio Ciaccia, a Columbus-based drug-pricing analyst. 
As the amount of that money grew 13-fold in as many years, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee wanted to know whether 340B was really fulfilling the program’s goal to “stretch scarce Federal resources as far as possible.”
The multi-year investigation focused on two hospitals.
“These hospitals were selected for this investigation as a result of media reports alleging abuse of the 340B Program, such as hospitals cutting services to underserved populations and expanding into affluent areas to increase reimbursement rates and subsequent revenue under the 340B Program,” the committee report, which was released last month, said.
The other hospital chain, Cincinnati-based Bon Secours Mercy Health, will be the subject of a separate story. 
Regarding Cleveland Clinic, the Senate report referred to a 2022 Wall Street Journal story. It said the hospital didn’t admit enough Medicaid and low-income patients to qualify under the original 340B rules. But under a quirk in the new rules, it was allowed in as a “rural-referral center” even though it’s headquartered in the middle of a big city.
General funds
In analyzing the data the submitted by Cleveland Clinic, the Senate committee found that between April 2020 and June 2023, the hospital chain received $934 million in benefit from the 340B program. Yet, even though the reason for the program’s existence is to support care for people who can’t do so themselves, Cleveland Clinic didn’t use those funds to directly defray patients’ drug costs.
“Cleveland Clinic… explained that it does not pass 340B discounts directly to patients because ‘there is no dollar-for-dollar, pass-on requirement to patients under the 340B statute’ and the statute ‘was intentionally left general to provide safety-net providers with latitude on how they use their savings in the ever-changing health care industry,’” the report said.
Instead, Cleveland Clinic said it “applies its 340B benefit ‘to the health system’s overall operating expenses and revenues in order to offset the cost of providing health care services to the communities [it] serve[s] and to maintain and invest in programs that enhance patient services and access to care.’”
Cleveland Clinic said it didn’t track the 340B millions after putting them in the revenue pot. But it said it spends huge amounts underwriting care for low-income Ohioans.
In 2023, it provided $261 million in free or discounted care to more than 110,000 patients, a spokeswoman said on background. The clinic is the leading provider of Medicaid services, charity care and mental health services in Ohio, she said.
She also pointed out that in 2024, Cleveland Clinic had an operating margin of $276 million, while it spent $261 million discounting care a year earlier. 
However, that excludes income the tax-exempt nonprofit makes from its sizable investments. When you include that, Cleveland Clinic made $911 million in net income in 2023, Healthcare Dive reported.
Also, those narrow operating margins come after paying out hefty salaries.
According to Cleveland Clinic’s 2023 IRS Form 990, President and CEO Tom Mihaljevic was paid $7 million. That was more than 100 times Ohio’s median household income for that year. 
In all, more than 50 of the top decision-makers at Cleveland Clinic made more than $500,000 as they set and enacted a budget subsidized by hundreds of millions of 340B dollars that are notionally meant to support charity care.
“Cleveland Clinic sets executive compensation in accordance with the process developed by the IRS to ensure that such compensation is determined in a fair and impartial manner taking relevant comparative data into account,” the clinic’s spokeswoman said.
Who pays?
In its response to the Senate report, Cleveland Clinic claimed the 340B program doesn’t cost taxpayers.
“As the cost of providing healthcare continues to rise, the 340B program helps us save resources that would have otherwise been spent on purchasing medications but instead can be directed to providing care, at no additional taxpayer expense,” it said.
However, just as others have to pay the taxes nonprofits don’t, drugmakers don’t simply absorb the tens of billions in discounts they’re required to give under the 340B program, said Ciaccia, the drug pricing analyst. In fact, many of the low-income patients the program is supposed to benefit help pay for it.
That’s because those with private insurance — or who are uninsured — don’t pay for drugs on the basis of 340B discounts. They have to pay based on the inflated prices the clinic and its contracted pharmacies charge in order to generate the program’s income.
Everyone with employer-based insurance also pays because those plans also don’t get the 340B discount — or in some cases even a slice of manufacturer rebates they might get in non-340B pharmacy transactions, Ciaccia said. And, as with so many other things, increased insurance costs are usually passed on to consumers.
Ciaccia added that as with rebates, mandatory 340B discounts give drugmakers an incentive to increase the list prices of drugs — increases that are felt most acutely by those who are least able to pay.
“In recent years, the list prices for drugs have arguably exploded, creating greater and greater pressure for government programs, employers, and sick patients to access medicines — not through actual affordable prices — but instead through negotiated or mandated discounts off of those bloated prices,” Ciaccia said. “Programs like 340B double down on our system’s addiction to discounts, pressuring the list prices of medicines higher. But instead of passing those discounts through, the end payer gets stuck with a bloated tab at the pharmacy counter. One way or another, the bill always comes due.”

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.












We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective




But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

Tech giant Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, testified on an Ohio bill to require age verification to download from app stores.
Millions of kids use social media.
“I’m a parent,” Jennifer Hanley, head of safety policy in North America at Meta, said. “I know teens are on so many apps.”
That’s why Hanley headed to the Ohio Statehouse to testify in support of House Bill 226, which would require age verification for all app store purchases or downloads for minors.
“The broad support of parents and lawmakers across political and ideological spectrums should not be ignored,” she said.
State Rep. Melanie Miller, who introduced the bill, said this would hold companies accountable — ones like Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.
Manufacturers would need to create a way for parents to give consent for kids under 16 to download any application, and then that will be sent to social media apps.
“I’m introducing this legislation to protect children from harmful content, reduce mental health risks, enhance data privacy, and encourage responsible technology use,” Miller said.
Although House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, likes the bill, she is skeptical of the tech giant.
“All you have to do is look at the opposition that they have waged not only in state legislation in this space, but also federal legislation in this space,” Russo said.
Meta has been filing lawsuits against social media age requirements across the country, including in Ohio. The state legislature passed restrictions on media apps for kids under 16 in 2023, but it has now been blocked by a federal judge due to free speech concerns.
This bill is different because it is not just targeting social media apps, but all apps, Hanley testified.
Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit, saying that the company used “manipulative tactics to entice teens and tweens.”
Russo agrees, adding that the company could be doing much more to protect kids.
“Do I think that it is going to be as effective as some of the other things we know they have the capacity to do using their own algorithms?” she said rhetorically. “Probably not.”
Only in the past year, Meta created a teen program to monitor and restrict what minors can access and who they can talk to.
“We’re always learning, we’re always building,” Hanley said. “Teen accounts are a really great example of that.”
The bill will continue being heard in the coming months.

(Eric Thomas illustration for Kansas Reflector)In one way, this is the easiest column I’ve written. 
It’s simple to celebrate public media in Kansas: public radio, educational television, veteran journalists, original reporting, local focus, innovative podcasts and more. For all that, I’m a long-time sustaining member of my local public radio station. And I have written many glowing columns about NPR journalism. Public media in Kansas is awesome.
In another way, this column is tricky. Defending anyone, let alone an institution, from fraudulent attacks is challenging. It’s proving a negative, when the negative is certifiably bonkers. And coming from the White House.
Here goes.
On Tuesday, National Public Radio and three public radio stations sued the Trump administration in response to the May 1 executive order that sought to strip public media of its funding in the United States.
The NPR lawsuit, filed in the District of Columbia, asserts that Trump’s executive order “violates the expressed will of Congress and the First Amendment’s bedrock guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association, and also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.”
The 43-page filing pokes holes in Trump’s executive order: a brazen attempt to extinguish public media throughout the country — and harm its audience in Kansas — based on a partisan grudge.
Under even brief inspection, Trump’s May 1 executive order and the press statements that accompanied it look inept.
They read like the half-baked political flailing of the first Trump administration when the rationale for his decisions was foolish and risible.
Just like many of the actions of the first Trump administration, there is a more principled and legal argument to be made here: Persuade Congress to defund public broadcasting because taxpayer money simply doesn’t belong in the media. The executive order only fleetingly expresses that viewpoint: “Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.”
More often, the White House falsely accuses public radio. It dishes out fake news about the real news.
If not opposed by a lawsuit like the one filed Tuesday, Trump’s executive order would wreck two valuable American institutions for petty and deceptive reasons: hot-button word choices, political innuendo and pet peeves.
What’s Trump’s best response for NPR’s regret at labeling someone as “illegal” in their reporting? Defund NPR.
What’s Trump’s best response to PBS’s documentary about a transgender teen? Defund PBS.
Forever a predatory real estate developer, Trump wants to tear down public media rather than putting money into improvements.
This week’s NPR lawsuit points us to documents that reveal Trump’s pettiness toward public media. First, consider “President Trump Finally Ends the Madness of NPR, PBS,” a press release published by the White House in conjunction with the executive order.
We find 24 bullet point examples of “trash that has passed for ‘news’ at NPR and PBS.” Many of the bullet points, stripped of context, completely misrepresent each instance of public media reporting.
One bullet point links to an NPR audio chat from 2022, headlined: “Which skin color emoji should you use? The answer can be more complex than you think.” During the discussion, the NPR host says, “These are not particularly easy questions for people to wrestle with.” The guest replies, “I completely agree with you that there is no clear-cut answer.”
How did the White House boil down this nuanced discussion of race? The press release says, “NPR assigned three reporters to investigate how the thumbs-up emoji is racist.”
NPR never used the word racist.
Summarizing the coverage in that way isn’t a political distortion. It’s a lie.
Here’s another White House claim from the same press release: “NPR routinely promotes the chemical and surgical mutilation of children as so-called ‘gender-affirming care’ without mentioning the irreversible damage caused by these procedures.” This bullet point links to a 2023 story from Florida by Melissa Block.
It’s a mind-bending stretch to see NPR as “promoting” medical care for trans kids in this journalism. The writer quotes experts — medical groups, plus an endocrinologist and a psychologist — as they each endorse the medical care.
Dear White House media critics, covering an issue is not to promote one side.
When the administration isn’t misrepresenting the work of public media, it nitpicks political language. In the press release’s final bullet point, the White House writes about the “PBS show Sesame Street partnered with CNN on a one-sided narrative to ‘address racism’ amid the Black Lives Matter riots.”
One-sided narrative? I wondered.
Clicking the link takes you to a cheerful image of Sesame Street characters with the title, “Coming Together: Standing Up to Racism.” What is the other side of racism that the White House wants represented here? Pro-racism?
The White House should be pressured to explain the “other side” of the debate that it is imagining, not Big Bird and PBS.
(The most likely true objection to this program? Sesame Street partnered with CNN, a network Trump would defund if he could.)
Taken as a whole, the list reads like a vendetta seeking a motive: Let’s destroy public media, but first we need a reason.
Given the White House’s complaints about news coverage in their press release, it seems that the executive order is in fact retaliation. Or, consider how the NPR lawyers metaphorically put it:
“It is not always obvious when the government has acted with a retaliatory purpose in violation of the First Amendment. ‘But this wolf comes as a wolf.’ … The Order targets NPR and PBS expressly because, in the President’s view, their news and other content is not ‘fair, accurate, or unbiased.’ ”
And yet, there’s more. Multiplying the unfairness of the lawsuit and executive order is the fundamental fairness of NPR’s news coverage. As a journalism instructor at the University of Kansas, I use NPR resources in my classroom precisely because they are among the most trustworthy and unbiased.
It’s not just me who sees it this way. Say what you will of the charts that organize media organizations in terms of bias; NPR is one of the most centrist sources, regardless of which media critics you trust.
“Our people report straight down the line,” said NPR CEO Katherine Maher during an appearance on CBS. “I think that not only do they do that, they do that with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public. That is the point of public broadcasting. We bring people together in those conversations.”
During the past few weeks, as public media has defended itself against these garbage attacks, Trump’s order has been characterized as a disproportionate attack on people who live in rural areas, including large swaths of Kansas.
The faces of this defense have been the CEOs of NPR and the Public Broadcasting System. Each has stressed how rural audiences will suffer.
On Tuesday, Maher released a statement that repeatedly stressed the NPR’s nationwide virtue of “serving all 50 states and territories” as a source for “tens of millions of Americans.”
“Without public dollars, NPR’s investment in rural reporting initiatives, collaborative regional newsrooms, and award-winning international coverage would all be at risk,” Maher wrote.
Lisa Rodriguez, interim director of content for KCUR, an affiliate station in Kansas City, appeared on the station’s “Up To Date” show to explain how small rural member stations rely on NPR.
“For KCUR, you depend on it for what you hear every day,” Rodriguez said. “But also at these smaller stations, you don’t have as rich a local journalism ecosystem. It is sometimes the only news that is reaching small communities.”
To call the White House’s arguments weak should not minimize their gravity. The consequences of the executive order would be catastrophic, especially to Kansans, if they hold up in court.
Through the rhetoric of this executive order and its press release, Trump relishes in playing the schoolyard bully once again. This time he is not so much name calling or picking on the vulnerable. With public media, he threatens to take his ball, go home and leave Kansans stranded.
Why? The bully doesn’t like the way the game is being played.
However, as the lawsuit makes clear, it is not his ball. And he has no right to take it.
NPR and its fellow plaintiffs seek their continuing independence in their lawsuit. They quote a legal precedent that interpreted NPR’s founding legislation as creating an “elaborate structure … to insulate (broadcasters) from government interference.”
Later, the suit continues, that while “Congress is not obligated to support independent public radio with federal funds,” the government cannot remove funding in a way that unconstitutionally infringes on free speech.
Unfortunately, our current Congress does not appear willing to reassert itself against Trump’s hallucinatory rhetoric and orders.  
This week’s lawsuit and its path through the courts may be the only remedy to save public broadcasting in Kansas.

Court Street in Athens, Ohio.
“A newspaper’s duty is to print the news and raise hell,” it said.
When Bruce walked in to greet me, I gestured toward the sign.
“I love reporting the news,” I grinned. “And I love raising hell.”
He beamed back with his wide, open smile and laughed his approval.
After our conversation that day, I knew kismet had found us — a shared bulldog energy for public accountability against corruption combusting in our professional cores.
Hard-nosed and never afraid of confrontation, but not militant or hateful, this energy is fueled not by fear, contempt, vengeance, or resentment, but an absolute love and commitment to community, humanity, truth, justice, and public service.
Having for years read and admired the work of longtime Editor Terry Smith, Jim Phillips, and Nick Claussen, I knew quickly after my interviews with Terry and Bruce that The Athens NEWS would mean something in my life.

Perhaps, though, I didn’t fully recognize how deep and profound its meaning until just last weekend, when many of us were reunited in Athens to celebrate Bruce’s life and legacy following his passing on April 29 at the age of 71.
As I watched a slideshow last Saturday of Bruce living this joyful, fiercely unique, caring, heart-forward, service-oriented, wildly colorful life, I could not help but be struck by the force and magnitude of all that he and Terry had built. Of course, many others helped, from Bruce’s wonderful wife Susan and his business partner Guy Philips, to the countless reporters, staff and sales reps, graphics people and photographers who contributed so much along the way.
I joined the NEWS at the very start of 2009, after Terry hired me as a new staff reporter over the holidays.
I had been a student reporter for the campus bureau of the paper during my senior year at Ohio University. I used those first crucial professional clips to obtain an internship in Washington D.C., which turned into a job at the National Journal’s The Hotline. That led to a job for the New York Observer’s Politicker covering the 2008 campaign cycle in then-battleground Ohio. After the election was over, they laid us all off.
I needed a new reporting job, and wanted to gain a wider variety of coverage experience. Terry was looking for a reporter with political coverage chops. Bruce had already been printing the news and raising hell for more than three decades as publisher of The Athens NEWS, which he founded in 1977, fresh after graduating from Ohio University and raising plenty of hell as a campus leader and activist.
While I was an undergrad, I read every twice-weekly edition of The Athens NEWS.
I loved — and still love — the tactile quality of flipping through a physical newspaper: the feel, the sound, the smell, the vibe. The Athens NEWS was free, ubiquitous around the campus and city, and useful. With no smartphones back then, every Monday and Thursday I would sit down to lunch at one of the dining halls and read the whole thing.
From the NEWS, I knew every event at every venue every weekend throughout the city and county. I knew all the bands, all the players, all the local personalities, the best bars and food spots, the best deals, all the clubs and activities, all the festivals, all the opportunities.
I knew everything Ohio University was up to, and anything nefarious the administration might be trying to pull. I knew everything the city and county was up to as well, and anything untoward any local officials might be trying to pull. I knew the crime, I knew the scandals.
When I joined the full-time team, it was a blessing: With Bruce’s passionate, tireless crusade against public corruption and injustice of any kind, I knew I had the freedom to be the best bulldog reporter I could be.
With Jim Phillips’ extraordinary, polished, and excellent example, I could study a master reporter at work. And with Terry Smith’s steady-handed, level-headed, practical, insightful, inquisitive mentorship and guidance, I learned everything I ever needed to know about how to run a newsroom like a true pro.
I expected to be at The Athens NEWS for two years. I ended up staying for nine.
We held powerful local politicians accountable to the people, and Ohio University accountable to its students and the larger community. We exposed schemes, scams, and abuse.
We did all the everyday reporting that the community needed. We featured everybody making a positive impact, told our readers the heartbreaking truth about poverty and all its attendant ills in Appalachia, exposed predatory landlords and corrupt politicians, and produced every kind of special issue, student and visitor guide imaginable. I got to write everything from restaurant reviews and Goo Goo Dolls interviews, to deeply reported issue coverage of addiction in Southeast Ohio.
While Terry ran the show in the newsroom — ever-balancing Bruce’s intensity and more feverish ideas with Terry’s own steady and serious news judgment — behind the operation as a whole stood Bruce, a pied-piper with a wild tie and funny hat, deepening community connections, leading our march in the Halloween parade, handing out turkeys at Thanksgiving and trees at Christmas, taking us to Cincinnati for Reds games, throwing birthday pizza parties, insisting relentlessly on fun.
He was one-of-a-kind, never meant for mass production, and others have written lovely tributes outlining the many memorable stories about Bruce and the wonderful things he accomplished, including former reporter Miles Layton and longtime Athens NEWS columnist Dennis E. Powell.
In my time there, I got all the invaluable reporting experience I craved, covering local government, crime and the courts, education, health care, energy and the environment, natural disasters, public corruption, protests and riots.
After working first in D.C. and then Columbus, I finally saw and learned how policy impacts Ohioans’ lives at the ground level. I’d been in their homes. I’d heard their stories. I’d witnessed their tears.
What happens at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus is not theoretical to me; I know the repercussions in my heart — I know the faces of the people being harmed.
And perhaps therein lies the source of my largest debt of gratitude to Bruce, Terry, Jim, and the whole rest of the entire Athens NEWS team over the years.
Everything I learned there became a part of me. I carry it all within me now, at the Ohio Capital Journal, with my own team.
So last Saturday, as I sat there in my beloved Athens, reunited for this celebration of life, a wave of gratitude, appreciation, and admiration crashed over me.
What a helluva great and noble thing Bruce had done, creating The Athens NEWS and building it into the beautiful community newspaper that it was.
Over the decades, an upstart alternative newsweekly became, by the time Bruce retired in 2015 — and for five years after through Terry and Conor Morris — what ought to always be remembered as an absolute powerhouse of local Ohio journalism.
Fair, fearless, free, fact-based reporting for the people.
Those are actually the mission taglines for the Ohio Capital Journal, but they may as well have been the taglines for The Athens NEWS. I realize now that this whole ethos was inspired and ingrained in me during my time there. And by some wild grace I have the good fortune to continue on with it with States Newsroom, dedicated only to doing the best journalism possible.
Before I left Bruce’s celebration of life last Saturday, having reflected on all of this, I made sure to tell Susan how grateful I was for the role that she and Bruce and The Athens NEWS played in my life, and how fortunate I feel to be able to try to continue some of that legacy today with the work of the Ohio Capital Journal.
Graceful and gracious as ever, Susan gave me a hug and told me that Bruce had followed our work at the Capital Journal and he was proud. That made my eyes well up. I hadn’t seen Bruce in the years after I moved to Columbus and they moved to Key West, but I knew that if he ever read the Capital Journal then he would’ve recognized various reflections of the kind of work we did at the NEWS. That made me smile.
Bruce was a man who cared passionately about others and cared passionately about justice and community. He lived with joy, loved deeply, fought corruption relentlessly, and poured himself into his community with no reservations. He was a wild man, with a great big honest heart, and to me, that counts for everything. Bravo, my friend.

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
States push to combat human trafficking amid federal funding cuts

Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
Most violent crime rates have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, new report shows

After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
Crime victims may get fewer services as federal aid drops. States weigh how to help.

For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Local school systems straining to comply with the state’s sweeping Blueprint for Maryland’s Future have had to report to both the Maryland Department of Education and the Blueprint’s Accountability and Implementation Board, a setup creating confusion “since the get-go.”
Now, more than three years into the process, the two agencies said they are working on a memorandum of understanding that could make things a bit smoother for all concerned.
Alex Reese, chief of staff with the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), did not tell the state Board of Education on Thursday how long it would take to finalize an agreement, but he said a memorandum is in the works.
State law requires the seven-member AIB to oversee the 10-year plan and approve any Blueprint documents submitted by the state’s 24 school systems and other state agencies that craft elements of the Blueprint.
The law also requires the department to provide technical assistance and lend expertise on education policy. The AIB and state Board of Education also hold occasional joint meetings and approve certain policies associated with the multibillion-dollar Blueprint plan.
Reese said “MSDE will be fully owning Blueprint implementation. We feel good about that as practitioners. We really do feel like we possess that expertise to be able to be poised to fully implementing the Blueprint.”
An AIB spokesperson confirmed in an email Thursday evening an agreement is being worked on with the department.
“AIB and MSDE attorneys are working together on an MOU [memorandum of understanding] relating to the agencies’ respective roles and duties,” the spokesperson said.
‘Blueprint’ bill that avoids some of the most severe education cuts is signed into law

“There is not currently a timeline confirmed for finalizing it. Because it is an MOU directly between the AIB and MSDE, there would be no need for General Assembly approval,” the email said.
In a quick summation to the state board Thursday, Reese said certain processes will remain the same such as the Blueprint board providing instructions to school systems on what is required in each Blueprint plan. It will continue “interagency collaboration” with agencies such as the state Higher Education Commission, which focuses on two of the Blueprint’s five pillars, or priorities – hiring and retaining high-quality and diverse teachers, and preparing students for college and technical careers.
The news was welcomed by school leaders, educators and advocates who have expressed frustration over the process of implementing the comprehensive education reform plan.
“One of the biggest complaints, if not the biggest, has been the lack of clarity and final guidance and where we get questions answered. We’ve got to run every decision by both entities [MSDE and AIB],” said Mary Pat Fannon, executive director of the Public School Superintendents’ Association of Maryland.
The association released a 12-page document in December that outlined proposals to help improve the plan. One of those recommendations was clearing up the relationship between the two agencies.
“Restructuring and clarifying the relationship of the MSDE and AIB would be very beneficial in the implementation of the Blueprint. This change would clarify roles and responsibilities, and establish clear guidance to the LEAs [local education agencies, or school systems] that they are governed by the procedures and processes promulgated by the MSDE and the State Board,” the December report said.
“Somebody’s got to be the point. Somebody’s got to be the team captain on certain things,” Fannon said.  “Otherwise, it’s just completely frustrating.”
“We are happy they are doing this. This is all going to help in implementation when these guys are 100% clear with us,” Fannon said of the work on an MOU.
Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Lower Shore) was also pleased by the discussions, which she said would help improve the process at the local and state levels. But the senator hopes an agreement can be reached before the 2025-26 school year begins in the fall.
“I would like to think they would make every effort to use the time between now and [when] school starts to give as much clarity to the roles and responsibilities, since it will only have a positive impact at the local level,” Carozza said. “That would be my expectation to keep that on track and to keep it moving.”

A lawsuit filed this week hopes to change that. (File photo William J. Ford/Maryland Matters.)Five Maryland voters who are not affiliated with any political party filed a lawsuit this week asking a state judge to declare the state’s restrictions on primary elections a violation of the state constitution.
Maryland, which has a partially closed primary system, requires voters to affiliate with the Democratic or Republican party if they want to vote in the primary election. The five unaffiliated voters, represented by Republican former Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, said the elections — paid for with tax dollars — are a violation of their right to vote.
“The point is, it really is a voting rights issue,” Rutherford, who is now an attorney with Davis, Agnor, Rapaport & Skalny in Columbia, said in an interview. “It’s not an attack on the parties. It’s a question of what is fair for 22% — over a fifth of the voting population — approaching 25% of the voting population that has chosen not to be affiliated.”

The 15-page lawsuit filed in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court on behalf of the five unaffiliated voters challenges the current primary election system. All five said they were barred from voting in the 2022 and 2024 primary elections because they opted not to affiliate with either major political party.
Requiring party affiliation to vote creates a barrier of “partisan primaries that the state endorses and supports and funds, which is contrary to the plain reading of the state constitution and the Declaration of Rights,” Rutherford said.
It is a subject with which Rutherford has some personal experience. In 2015, Rutherford told The Washington Post that he was a registered independent but changed his affiliation to Democrat to vote in primary elections in the District of Columbia.
A spokesperson for the Maryland State Board of Elections did not provide a comment on the suit pending litigation.
John Willis, who served as secretary of state under Gov. Parris N. Glendening, and is a professor of public affairs at the University of Baltimore, said the lawsuit is misplaced.
“Primary elections are for political parties. They’re not for 4 million individual voters,” said Willis, who is also an attorney. “They’re a process for nominating candidates for a general election. The whole notion that they’re somehow open to everybody, the public — there’s no constitutional right to that.”
Unaffiliated voters in Maryland can cast votes in state primaries for nonpartisan races such as the election of judges and school board members.
But. the voters in the lawsuit compare the process to “taxpayers funding the selection of officers to private clubs or in this case private entities.”

	Rutherford said it is the use of taxpayer dollars that conflicts with his clients’ rights.
“We’re just saying the state should not be paying for it, because the state would be paying for something that’s unconstitutional,” Rutherford said. “This is, again, it’s a voting rights question, so the state should not be supporting something that is unconstitutional.”
In Maryland, the number of voters who identify as unaffiliated has grown to nearly one in five voters in the state. Willis said that growth is a “legitimate thing to talk about.”
“But I don’t think it’s a lawsuit. I think it’s a political debate or a philosophical debate. It’s an OK political debate to have, but I don’t think it’s a legal constitutional debate.”
To Willis, the appropriate venue for making a change is the legislature.
Rutherford, in an interview, said the legislature is unlikely to make those changes.
“I don’t think the legislature sees it in their interest, even though they should, because it is a question of voting rights,” Rutherford said. We think the courts need to take it up, just like the Voting Rights Act or Brown versus Board of Education. The legislature alone is not going to do it.”
Willis said the current political system dates back more than 100 years. “Since the Civil War, in Maryland, we’ve been a two-party system,” he said.

Legislation sponsored in 2023 by Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery) called for allowing unaffiliated voters to affiliate with a party as late as the day before the start of early voting.
Kagan, who was not available for an interview, said in 2023 testimony that many unaffiliated voters “do not understand our closed primary system.” Then, when they arrive to vote, they are told they can vote in nonpartisan races. That sometimes causes voters to become “frustrated — and sometimes quite angry,” Kagan’s written testimony said.
Her bill and an identical House bill both died in their respective committees.
In 2000, the Maryland Republican Party did briefly change its rules to let unaffiliated voters cast ballots in its presidential primary. The change was short-lived.
A spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party declined to comment on the pending lawsuit. A representative of the Maryland Republican Party was not immediately available for comment.
The lawsuit is backed by the Open Primaries Education Fund, a nonprofit that advocates for allowing unaffiliated voters to participate in primary elections. The group also promotes the use of litigation toward that goal.
Rutherford said the group and its local affiliate reached out to him about challenging the state primary system after the two-term lieutenant governor authored an opinion piece calling for allowing unaffiliated or independent voters to participate in primary elections.
And while the debate over Maryland’s primary system is not new, Rutherford said the lawsuit is novel in its approach.
“It’s been challenged in other states, one, generally in the federal courts. Not as much so in the state courts,” said Rutherford, adding that he believes there has never been a challenge under the Maryland Constitution.
The constitution, Rutherford said, sets out specific rules for qualifying voters. Maryland residents 18 years old and older “shall be entitled to vote at every election, all elections,” Rutherford said.
“They said all elections,” Rutherford said. “Nowhere in the constitution does it state anything about primaries or political parties or anything of that notion. And then the Declaration of Rights, which is part of the constitution, goes further by stating that it talks about the right of suffrage.”
Maryland is one of nine states that have a partially closed primary system, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In such systems, the parties can choose to allow unaffiliated voters to vote in their respective primary elections.
Seven states are considered open to unaffiliated voters. Those systems allow unaffiliated voters to vote in the party primary of their choice. Voters who are affiliated with a political party must vote in that party’s primary.
Another 15 states have open primaries — voters are not asked to affiliate with a party. Voters can then choose which primary they wish to cast a ballot in.

(Maryland Matters file photo)The Trump administration on Thursday said Maryland and several of its counties and cities are sanctuary jurisdictions for immigrants, a designation that will bring a warning from federal officials along with a vague threat of the loss of unspecified federal funds.
The Maryland governments were among more than 500 jurisdictions nationwide, including states and local governments, labeled sanctuary jurisdictions by the Department of Homeland Security, in response to an April 28 executive order by President Donald Trump (R).
Sanctuary jurisdictions come in many forms, but they are generally governments with policies that limit the ability of local authorities to cooperate with federal immigration agencies. Supporters say the policies make local communities safer by increasing immigrant trust in local police agencies and making them more willing to work with police.
But Trump, in his executive order, said sanctuary policies “violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws” in a “lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law.” The order directs the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security to contact jurisdictions on the list, and it further requires federal agency heads to identify grants, contracts and other funds that could be withheld from the jurisdictions “as appropriate.”
The Homeland Security list tagged the state of Maryland, eight counties and 10 municipalities. The department said it determined whether a government was a sanctuary jurisdiction “by factors like compliance with federal law enforcement, information restrictions, and legal protections for illegal aliens.”
The department labeled Maryland as a “Self-Identification as a State Sanctuary Jurisdiction,” but doesn’t summarize what that entails.

“DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,” the department’s statement said.
Despite the administration’s repeated claim that sanctuary policies violate federal law or obstruct federal immigration enforcement, the policies do neigher. And local officials were already pushing back Thursday against threats from federal officials.
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) released a statement Thursday that mentions the possibility of suing the administration, after his city was listed as a sanctuary jurisdiction.
“To be clear: by definition, Baltimore is not a sanctuary city, because we do not have jurisdiction over our jails. We follow our limited obligations as defined under federal immigration law,” Scott said.
“But we are a welcoming city, and we make no apologies for that,” his statement said. “We are better because of our immigrant neighbors, and we are not about to sell them out to this administration.”
Six of the 10 Maryland municipalities the department designated as sanctuary cities are in Prince George’s County: the towns of Cheverly and Edmonston, and the cities of College Park, Greenbelt, Hyattsville and Mount Rainier.
Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s), chair of the Legislative Latino Caucus, said in a text message Thursday night that labels such as “sanctuary jurisdiction” oversimplify work done to serve and protect residents.
“Maryland, Prince George’s County and our municipalities have long embraced policies that create welcoming, inclusive communities where all residents – regardless of immigration status – can live with dignity and safety,” Martinez said. “These local approaches are rooted in public trust, safety and effective governance, not political defiance.”
In addition to Baltimore City, the other Maryland cities on the list are Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, and Rockville and Takoma Park in Montgomery County. Maryland counties on the DHS list were Anne Arundel, Baltimore County, Charles, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George’s, Queen Anne’s and Talbot.
Maryland does offer limited benefits to undocumented immigrants in the state, including the ability to get a driver’s license and to be able to buy health insurance in the state marketplace under some circumstances. But state lawmakers also approved a watered-down version of an immigration bill last month, in the final minutes of the 2025 legislative session,
That bill was originally going to prohibit so-called 287(g) agreements, which allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to delegate some federal enforcement authorities to local officers. But the Senate stripped that language out and the House relented. The final version of the bill, which becomes law Sunday, gives limited protection against immigration actions in “sensitive locations,” such as churches, schools or hospitals.

,California,2025-05-30 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom tussles with local officials over homelessness,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/newsom-homelessness-california-local/,"As Newsom and legislators fashion a new state budget, verbal exchanges between him and local officials about who is to blame have become sharper.","Throughout Gavin Newsom’s governorship, he and local government officials have been squabbling over financial support and accountability for programs to reduce California’s largest-in-the-nation homelessness crisis.
Simply put, Newsom has blamed local officials for not clearing their streets of squalid encampments, while they have complained that piecemeal state appropriations make it impossible to create effective ongoing programs.
With Newsom and state legislators in the final throes of fashioning a new state budget, and facing chronic gaps between income and outgo, the verbal exchanges between the governor and local officialdom have become sharper and the differences between county and city officials have become more obvious.
While homelessness is largely found within cities, particularly large cities, county governments operate most of the medical and social programs to combat the syndrome, leading to conflicts over which local government should be held accountable.
The division among local governments is a statewide problem, but it is most apparent in Los Angeles County, where a joint city-county homelessness agency is being dismantled amid sharp criticism of its failures.
When he unveiled his latest version of the budget this month, Newsom pledged to ramp up pressure on the locals by introducing new accountability processes and conditioning state aid on identifiable results. He also proposed a model ordinance he said local governments could use to clear encampments.
“No one in our nation should be without a place to call home. As we continue to support our communities in addressing homelessness, we expect fast results, not excuses,” Newsom said in a statement. “While we are pleased by the progress many communities have made to address the homelessness crisis, there is more work to do.”
County officials responded combatively, reiterating their position that year-by-year financial support from the state undermines their efforts. They proposed a five-year experiment, dubbed AT HOME, in which multi-year financing would be assured in counties that cooperatively delineate responsibilities for specific programs among local governments.
The California State Association of Counties also released an analysis of nearly $30 billion in state spending on housing and homelessness during Newsom’s governorship that it says failed to be effective.
“For years, the state has thrown one-time money at this problem without any real strategy,” Jeff Griffiths, an Inyo County supervisor and president of the association, said in a statement. “Our AT HOME proposal is credible, comprehensive, and directly addresses the state-imposed barriers to reducing homelessness. It’s time to act.”
The Big City Mayors coalition adopted a more conciliatory response to Newsom’s latest crackdown threat, releasing an “accountability update” to highlight what it said had been successful uses of annual state grants and asking Newsom and legislators to renew them.
“I’ve seen firsthand how our cities use (homeless) funds effectively to address homelessness,” the coalition’s chair, Riverside Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson, said in a statement. “In Riverside, we’ve reached functional zero for youth homelessness — ensuring every young person aged 18 to 24 has a path off the street.
 “With 94 permanent supportive housing units in the pipeline for vulnerable populations like veterans and individuals with disabilities, we know that real progress is possible. But it takes continued partnership between the state and our cities to keep this momentum going and continue delivering meaningful results.”
The blame game is likely to escalate, even as homelessness continues to fester, the voting public becomes more frustrated and Newsom’s governorship enters its final stage.

A[...]","Lawmakers created a long list of study committees during the 2025 legislative session, laying the groundwork for a busy offseason. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSchool may be out for the summer, but at the state Capitol in Atlanta, lawmakers are gearing up for their own version of summer school. Study committees, which meet outside the regular 40-day legislative session, have already begun gathering information and soliciting expert testimony on topics ranging from chronic student absenteeism to improving tourism.
All told, 16 different House study committees and 20 Senate panels will convene under the Gold Dome, which is the most each chamber has seen in the past decade. Here is a look at a few notable ones. 
Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence, or AI, has been a hot-button issue both in Georgia and around the country. During the 2025 session, legislators in both chambers introduced bills aimed at increasing regulations on the use of AI technology, but none managed to pass through both chambers by the Sine Die deadline.
However, two new study committees will allow legislators in the Senate to continue compiling research and drafting a report that may guide their efforts when lawmakers reconvene for the 2026 session next January. Senate Resolution 391, introduced by Roswell Republican Sen. John Albers, creates a new committee dedicated to examining the use of AI across industries like education, health care and financial services. The committee will also explore the use of digital and cryptocurrency, and how to better prevent security threats.
A second AI-related committee, created by SR 431, will study the impact of social media on children across Georgia, examining privacy implications and the impact of chatbots and other AI features on minors. The resolution was introduced by Atlanta Democrat Sen. Sally Harrell, who will serve as co-chair alongside Johns Creek Republican Sen. Shawn Still. 
Elections
Lawmakers are getting a jump start on election policy this year, perhaps hoping to avoid a repeat of the months-long battle between Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the five-member State Election Board that characterized the lead-up to Georgia’s 2024 election. 
House Resolution 885 established a special panel that will examine Georgia’s existing election code and how responsibilities are shared between election officials at the local and state levels. It will be chaired by Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican. 
Another study committee, created by SR 429, will research ways to remove barriers for those who are seeking to restore their voting rights after a felony conviction. Georgia “has one of the longest parole and probationary periods in the nation and the highest number of individuals under supervision per capita of any state,” according to the resolution. 
Insurance rates
The fight to overhaul Georgia’s civil litigation landscape may be settled for now, but discussions over Georgia’s insurance rates are set to continue. A newly created panel will investigate the driving forces behind insurance rate hikes throughout the state by analyzing insurance industry practices, profit margins and compliance with state regulations. It will be chaired by Duluth Republican Rep. Matt Reeves.
House lawmakers will also delve into how the state’s reinsurance landscape intersects with climate change in a study committee created by HR 40. Citing the estimated $6.46 billion in damage that Hurricane Helene caused in Georgia, lawmakers are hoping to combat insurance-related challenges that businesses may face during future storms and severe weather events.
Co-chaired by Republican Reps. Darlene Taylor of Thomasville and Noel Williams of Cordele, the committee aims to collaborate with the Georgia Office of Insurance and Department of Agriculture to mitigate rising property and casualty insurance costs for small businesses across the state.
Medical cannabis
Cannabis consumption, both medical and recreational, was another prominent issue that surfaced during the 2025 legislative session. While House Bill 227 and Senate Bill 220 both sought to widen access to medical cannabis, neither bill managed to make it over the finish line before lawmakers adjourned for the year. Instead, two separate study committees will tackle the issue over the summer.
A House study committee led by Augusta Republican Rep. Mark Newton, who works as a doctor, will dive into Georgia’s medical marijuana policies. In the Senate, lawmakers on the Study Committee on Intoxicating Cannabinoids in Consumable Hemp Products will tackle the issue of regulating recreational products like THC-infused drinks, which are chemically similar to medical cannabis but more broadly available to consumers because they fall under the federal 2018 Farm Bill and the Georgia Hemp Farming Act.
State income tax
Georgia lawmakers at both the state and federal level are pushing for legislation that would overhaul the current tax code, replacing the current system with a fixed consumption tax that proponents refer to as “FairTax.” The congressional version of the bill, which was first proposed in 1999, was sponsored this year by U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, who recently announced a bid for the U.S. Senate.
At the Georgia Capitol, the Senate State FairTax Study Committee will examine similar legislation that would apply a fixed sales tax rate within the Peach State. The committee will be chaired by Rome Republican Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, who also heads the Senate Finance Committee.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma House rose for a standing ovation Thursday after overturning the governor’s veto of a bill expanding access to mammograms for early breast cancer detection. 
Rep. Melissa Provenzano, D-Tulsa, the bill’s author, said the standing ovation was “powerful” and a reminder that people are humans before they are politicians. She was battling breast cancer for the length of the legislative session. 
Despite a nearly five hour delay in the Senate, the measure was one of nearly four dozen vetoes the House and Senate overturned on the penultimate day of session as they worked past midnight and into Friday morning before adjourning. Lawmakers moved to overturn the majority of Stitt’s vetoes.

Provenzano was met with another round of applause Thursday night when she returned to the House chamber after the Senate voted to finalize the veto override. 
“I’m just reminded again, that we’re humans first, politicians second,” Provenzano said. “And I think every member and every staff member and the people in this building, if what we experienced here is going on in the state of Oklahoma, then it’s time for something like this. Because everybody had a story of a sister or a mother, an aunt, a wife. And so it was just powerful.” 
Stitt said he vetoed the bill because while he is “sympathetic” to those battling breast cancer, the legislation would have imposed “new and costly” insurance mandates on private health plans and raised insurance premiums. 
To override a veto from the governor, two-thirds of representatives and senators must vote in favor of the measure or three-quarters if the measure contains an emergency provision. The dozens of overrides ranged from measures that aimed to increase public access to open records to missing and murdered indigenous people.
Some of the measures lawmakers vetoed included: 

House Bill 2785 that gives the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services the ability to review the budget and finances of the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, which has had ongoing financial troubles. The governor said it was “nonsensical and ineffective” to task one executive agency with micromanaging another; 
House Bill 2163 that gives the Attorney General’s Office the power to enforce violations of the Open Records Act. Stitt said the bill would give Attorney General Gentner Drummond “sweeping and unchecked authority” to access records from all state agencies, an “unprecedented” power in Oklahoma. Drummond had previously urged lawmakers to override the veto;
House Bill 2048 that prohibits insurers and pharmacy benefit managers from discriminatory reimbursement practices. Stitt wrote in his veto message that this was a federal issue and the Legislature should not insert itself. 
House Bill 1137 that removes a requirement that the Office of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons be federally funded, opening it up to state funding. Stitt said he vetoed the measure because he doesn’t endorse legislation that “singles out victims based solely on their race.” 

Stitt posted a video Thursday afternoon telling voters to closely watch how lawmakers vote on veto overrides. 
“This is stuff I know is bad for Oklahoma, bad for taxpayers,” he said in the video. “And you’ve got the Senate and House and special interest groups that are trying to override my vetoes.”

Stitt said Thursday that he had vetoed 68 bills this session that would overregulate businesses and create higher taxes for Oklahomans. He said voters should pay attention to which lawmakers supported overrides of his vetoes.
Rep. Scott Fetgatter, R-Okmulgee, referenced Stitt’s comments while making a motion to override a veto on one of his bills, House Bill 2459, which pertains to fire safety in mobile food vehicles. 
“Evidently, since the governor has called for all of us to be primaried that override his vetoes today, and his staff cant seem to read a bill correctly and they vetoed my bill, I make a motion to override the veto,” he said. 
National guard bill dispute draws out legislative day
Legislative proceedings stalled for nearly five hours after Senate leaders struggled to get the required number of votes necessary to override House Bill 2769. The measure contained a series of amendments to the leadership requirements and rules of the Oklahoma National Guard. The Senate passed the override just after 9 p.m. 
Stitt’s override message said he vetoed the bill because it made major changes to the National Guard and state finances without a thorough fiscal analysis. 
“While I applaud all our men and women who serve our country and our state in the National Guard, I cannot allow this bill to become law,” he wrote. “… The policies in this bill should be considered, reviewed, and debated as separate and distinct bills.”
The bill makes several amendments to the qualifications necessary to serve as adjutant general of the Oklahoma National Guard, an officer overseeing administrative and personnel matters. The position could now be filled by someone with a rank of colonel or higher. It also grants the officer additional powers. 
The officer is to be compensated at the same rate of pay afforded to a major general. Several changes were also made to the Oklahoma Uniform Code of Military Justice.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Lawmakers overnight Thursday voted to fire the state’s embattled mental health commissioner.
Saying that they had “lost confidence” in Allie Friesen’s ability to lead the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, legislators voted overwhelmingly to remove her effective immediately.
It marked the first time in recent history that lawmakers had taken such a step. 
The move follows a series of legislative hearings probing financial disarray at the agency, which is responsible for a budget of more than $700 million. 
Lawmakers had to make a multi-million dollar emergency appropriation to cover payroll and ensure contracts were fulfilled, while the state auditor recently released a critical audit. 
The legislative maneuver drew the ire of Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt who has continued to defend Friesen. He called it a “politically motivated witch hunt.”
Stitt said he tasked Friesen to bring accountability and transparency to the agency and suggested the mismanagement went back a decade or more.
“She disturbed the status quo and questioned long held practices at the agency,” Stitt said. “An agency rife with sweetheart deals and criminal elements was disrupted, and now elected officials are quickly working to set the apple cart right for those who seek to get rich off of Oklahoma taxpayers.”
Senate Concurrent Resolution 12, authored by Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, and Rep. Josh West, R-Grove, said state law allows the Legislature to remove the Friesen with a two-thirds vote in both chambers. 
The measure passed the Senate by a vote of 43-1.
The House passed it by a vote of 81-5.
“Our job is to come up here and make tough decisions,” West said.
Rosino said the vote was needed to protect people that needed mental health services.
He said the resolution didn’t mean Friesen was dishonest or bad, adding that she was kind and nice. But she was not competent to run the large agency, he said.
“We do not have a choice,” Rosino said. 
He said that he didn’t want the agency’s issues to fester in the interim.
Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, cast the lone Senate vote against the bill, saying Friesen was trying to fix the agency, which opened up a “hornet’s nest.”
“This is not the way to handle business,” he said.
The measure does not require the signature of Stitt, who appointed Friesen to the post in January 2024. 
Friesen has blamed the financial situation on prior administrations, but Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond called for her termination.
“While I cannot begin to understand why Gov. Stitt has chosen to protect Allie Friesen instead of our tax dollars, I applaud the legislative resolution to remove this failed bureaucrat from office,” Drummond said Thursday.
Stitt will now have to appoint a new person to run the mental health agency. Senate confirmation is required.

HB 5004 is a package of climate legislation ranging from a study on heat pumps to transitioning the workforce to green jobs. To see it pass the house this quickly is a victory for advocates and Connecticut residents alike. Still, the bill focused largely on studies instead of direct action. Climate and environmental justice advocates agree, HB 5004 could have been much stronger. 
I’m a 17-year-old climate activist, and for the past three years, I’ve been coming to Hartford and witnessing a frustrating pattern: bold climate legislation repeatedly stalling due to the legislature’s political culture.
The version of HB 5004 last year was significantly weakened with amendments before it passed the House in May 2024. The bill was never brought up for a vote in the Senate. This year, some of the bill’s strongest language was removed before passing the House. The House-passed HB 5004 bill failed to include a Future of Gas docket, which aims to align gas system planning with state climate policy while balancing ratepayer impacts. Legislators also cut out programs for Thermal Energy Networks and active demand response. Thermal Energy Networks are six times more efficient than air source heating, and active demand response would reduce electric demand at times when it is highest – in order to strain the grid less, and reduce energy prices.
Last year’s disappointment and this year’s weakened bill reflect the overall culture in the legislature, a culture which has indefinitely stalled and weakened important bills, preventing any climate action for the past two years.
Despite having a supermajority in both the House and Senate, Democratic leaders insist on bipartisan compromise and a strict tradition of unlimited debate. But this poses an issue: because the legislative session is only three to five months long, there is limited time for bills to be passed. Therefore, leadership usually only brings bills up for a vote after they have been compromised enough, behind closed doors, to easily pass with little debate. This is why legislators don’t move forward with stronger legislation, opting instead for less controversial study-focused bills like HB 5004.
HB 6280, the climate superfund bill introduced this year, is another example of stalled and watered-down legislation. The bill would have held polluting companies accountable by making corporations pay an amount of money proportionate to their share of emissions, and the impact of those emissions on Connecticut. The payments would have gone into a fund used for climate adaptation. The bill didn’t even make it out of committee because legislators assumed it was too progressive to pass.
The environmental rights amendment, SJ 36, is another bill sabotaged by a need to compromise. The bill would have codified the right to clean air, water, soil, environment, and a safe and stable climate into the state constitution. It was meant to be an umbrella of protection, filling in any gaps in existing law. However, the bill was amended to include the modifiers “reasonable” and “unreasonable.” While seemingly harmless, legal experts point out that based on legal precedent, “reasonable” is interpreted as referring to existing law (City of Waterbury v. Town of Washington 260 Conn 506 [2002]). The compromised language defeats the bill’s purpose of filling gaps in existing law and providing overarching protection.
SB 9, the climate resilience bill, also fell victim to compromise. Part of the bill is meant to ban the use of neonicotinoids (toxic insecticides) for many uses. However, the legislators yielded to the chemical industry’s demands. The bill was amended to exempt the use of neonicotinoids on ornamentals from the ban, and to delay the ban one year. There was even talk of adding an amendment that would partially roll back a 2010 ban on pesticide use on K-8 school grounds, which fortunately was rejected.
This is why Connecticut is falling behind not only on climate policy, but any policy that will actually do something real to improve Connecticut for its residents. Compromise and unlimited debate is killing necessary progress-– and Connecticut residents are the ones suffering the costs of high energy bills, climate disasters, and every other issue the legislature has bent to opposition on. 
Who are we really compromising with? The only winners from a lack of climate action are oil and gas companies. “Compromise” ends up being a very slippery slope toward allowing monied interests to infinitely water down the bills that get passed in our state. Our future is being compromised for their profit.
Back to HB 5004. Some of the removed language can be added to SB 4, a priority energy bill, which already includes language on thermal energy networks and demand response. I encourage anyone reading this to ask your legislators to advocate for all of these provisions to be voted on through SB 4.
Though the legislature may insist on compromising our future for polluter profit, we will continue to fight to protect it.

What happens next is up to us.
Last Tuesday, the state Senate unanimously passed SB 1542, a bill that would limit the use of handcuffs and restraints on children. As the legislative session nears its close, what happens next now rests with Connecticut’s House of Representatives and, hopefully soon, Gov. Ned Lamont.
Among northeastern states, Connecticut is uniquely harsh in its treatment of children. We are the only state in the region that allows fourth-graders (kids as young as ten) to be arrested and ushered into the legal system. Law enforcement has wide latitude to handcuff children — even those who have not been charged with a crime. Kids who get arrested can be held in detention before ever seeing a judge, and be bound by mechanical restraints in the courtroom. 
Our organization, The Connecticut Justice Alliance, works directly with young people impacted by the justice system. Our justice advisors provide valuable insight into the faults and failures of the system, and how it should change to better help the kids who encounter it. Many of them testified in support of this bill in front of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee this spring. We also hold conversations with incarcerated youth inside Manson Youth Institution, a children’s prison in Cheshire.  
Those young people reached the same conclusion as years of quantitative data and academic research: to help children change their behavior, they need to be treated like children.  
They say it takes a village to raise a child. We are that village.  
The unfortunate reality is that most offenses by kids stem from failures by adults and a lack of attention to the root causes of their struggles. From instability at home, violence in their communities, a lack of access to essential resources including food and medicine, addiction and mental health struggles, collectively we are failing to provide the support needed to set kids up for success.  
In prioritizing retribution above rehabilitation, we are setting them up for failure while weakening our overarching goals of improving local communities and strengthening public safety.  
The current rules make it more likely that kids interacting with our legal system now will commit criminal offenses as adults. It is self-fulfilling. It is a message to kids that we’ve given up trying to help and no longer view them as worthy of the effort. 
Originally, SB 1542 included a provision to raise the minimum age of arrest. That change was removed during negotiations, but it remains essential to our long-term goal of keeping kids out of the justice system entirely by investing in their education, well-being, and the health of their families and communities. Prevention is an investment in kids’ futures. It is more effective, costs less, and upholds our obligation as adults to make good decisions on behalf of children. When kids are supported early, they’re far less likely to end up in trouble later. 
Passing SB 1542 is an important step in the larger effort to steer kids toward better futures and away from courtrooms and cells. No child is disposable. We need policies that reflect that. 
In our sessions with incarcerated youth, we have noticed that they still think about what’s best for their communities back home. Many are working with us because they want other kids to avoid the mistakes they made and chart a better future for themselves. Kids deserve to see their state government demonstrate that same commitment. 
What happens next is in our hands. We urge lawmakers to pass SB 1542 and take this meaningful step toward a better future for Connecticut’s kids.

Lucy Dathan,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/30/preserving-public-elections-through-reforming-seec/,"The key objective of SB1405 is to update and improve the efficiency of the Citizens Election Program, while maintaining its independence and oversight of public campaigns.","Connecticut’s commitment to democracy, particularly through the Citizens’ Election Program (CEP), sets our state apart. For nearly 20 years, the CEP, overseen by the State Elections Enforcement Commission (SEEC), has leveled the playing field, enabling individuals from all backgrounds to run for state office without relying on wealthy donors.
Established in 2005 through bipartisan legislation and first implemented in the 2008 cycle, the CEP provides campaign funds to candidates who raise a significant number of small donations. These funds come with strict spending limits and transparency rules. A national model for public financing, the CEP has successfully removed dark money from state elections, fostering an independent electoral process and encouraging ordinary people to run for office.

State Rep. Lucy Dathan and Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox
However, the system isn’t perfect. In recent election cycles, campaigns have struggled with the SEEC’s complex policies and procedures. 
While multiple checks are essential to ensure legitimate donations, communication has been a major challenge. Campaigns wait weeks for explanations from SEEC when donations are rejected, despite multiple phone calls and emails asking for information. Protocols were unclear, and there seemed to be no differentiation between a trivial error, such as a donor writing “CT” rather than “Connecticut” on a five-dollar donation check, and a serious violation of election law. 
These problems greatly frustrated campaign treasurers, and the confusion caused by the process made it more difficult to persuade good people to volunteer for campaigns or to run for office themselves, undermining one of the very original purposes of the Citizens’ Election Program.
As co-chairs of the new Government Oversight Committee, we welcomed the opportunity to apply our own professional expertise and commitments to the work of improving transparency and accountability among our own government agencies. 
As Senate Chair, Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox’s background in law and constitutionalism provide a unique legal perspective that is particularly relevant for bills pertaining to government accountability. As House Chair, Lucy Dathan’s background in financial auditing, as a certified public accountant and a chief financial officer brings her vast experience in financial accountability to bills pertaining to public audits and audit processes. 
Our committee worked with other legislators and advocates to craft solutions to the problems brought to our attention. We sought to give SEEC more resources, including by reducing their workload, so that their work can be more effective to carry out their mission. We also worked on Senate Bill 1405. This legislation, which has now passed both Connecticut’s House and Senate and awaits the Governor’s signature, expands public access to SEEC meetings, adds important disclaimers to text messages, and clarifies the materials that campaign treasurers need to retain to assist in compliance with audits. 
The key objective of the bill is to update and improve the efficiency of the Citizens Election Program, while maintaining its independence and oversight of public campaigns. To ensure that changes are not perceived to be partisan, it was also important that the legislation to be supported by all four legislative caucuses.
SB 1405 ensures that updates and guidelines are released sooner, to ensure that candidates have adequate time to plan. Moreover, the bill requires additional clarity and communication over campaign disclosures. Importantly, no updates have been made to SEEC’s determination and review of qualifying grants, so 100% of all contributions will continue to be reviewed for that purpose.
The bill includes reforms to the post-election audit process. As of mid-April 2025, not even a third of audits from the November 2022 election have been finalized (29%) and none of the November 2024 audits have been finalized. This level of delay is unworkable. The agency has been auditing 100% of expenditures for approximately 50% of all campaigns, with each audit undergoing three to four levels of review or re-review by various staff. 
While there is no doubt that ensuring that public funds are spent carefully is essential, this level of scrutiny is excessive and inefficient. There are no auditing standards anywhere that require this level of scrutiny, and with this level of work done to get a clean audit opinion. This underscores why the audit parameters must change.
SB 1405 includes important changes that will strengthen the CEP and assist campaigns and treasurers in understanding what they need to do to comply. The legislation passed the Connecticut Senate on a vote of 34 to 1. Critics in the Connecticut House, where the bill also passed on a 92 to 46 vote, maintain that watchdog agencies such as SEEC should remain independent and that this legislation subordinates SEEC to the legislature. 
But the bill does not do so. It does not allow the legislature to approve or disapprove any regulations passed by SEEC whatsoever. The only aspect of this bill that has become a central point of contention when it comes to agency independence is the provision that requires a SEEC Executive Director seeking reappointment after a four-year term to receive confirmation by the legislature. The legislation does not change SEEC’s right to appoint its Executive Director in the first place. The legislature is the voice of the people; its function is to provide public oversight.
There are other areas too where agency independence is critical to the functioning of agency power, and where there is nevertheless minimal oversight by the legislature. For example, the judicial branch must be independent of the legislature, but the legislature still confirms judges, including the chief justice. To require some confirmation process of unelected public employees by legislators who are accountable to the people is also a part of our democratic process. The key is for that oversight to be limited to a minimal check on the agency and not become a kind of legislative overreach on its decision-making.
Over the course of the last several months, we have all witnessed the destruction wrought by an unaccountable watchdog agency whose leadership is not confirmed by the legislature. That description perfectly fits the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk. While we are not comparing SEEC, which is replete with excellent public officials, to DOGE, we are suggesting that the claim that DOGE should be entirely isolated from the legislature as a watchdog agency should give us pause, and raises an important question for all of us: what are the potential consequences of other watchdog agencies that seek an exemption from any legislative oversight? This is why we must balance the independence of watchdog agencies with the need for such agencies to also be transparent and accountable to the public.
Senate Bill 1405 attempts to strike this delicate balance. It allows SEEC to remain independent and therefore shields its regulations from scrutiny by the legislature. While earlier drafts contained some language that seemed to infringe more on separation of powers, that language was appropriately removed, and the final bill does not cross that line. 
It requires SEEC operations to be more transparent, and its procedures to be clearly defined to campaigns. It also requires some oversight of a SEEC Executive Director by a legislature that is accountable to the public. That is already the process in place for the remaining commissioners of SEEC, and the bill does not include any legislative approval of agency regulations and guidelines. Those agency protocols, which are entirely initiated by the agency, and must be transparent and universal, serve as the basis of SEEC’s regulatory decisions when it comes to each individual candidate. That further isolates SEEC from any legislative overreach into agency decision-making.
This legislation is a win for Connecticut, encouraging public financing, clarifying audit procedures, and allowing SEEC to operate more efficiently. We’ve already received positive feedback from campaign treasurers, and we remain committed to supporting the Citizens Election Program and SEEC and advocating for transparent, accountable, and ethical government in Connecticut.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-30 03:44:36+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT House unanimously passes bill boosting support, oversight for special education",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/29/ct-special-education-funding-oversight/,Bill increases regulation of private special education providers while adding funds for districts to develop their own in-house programs.,"The House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill Thursday increasing regulation and oversight of private special education providers while also providing funds to encourage districts to develop their own in-house programs. 
The bill, which sought to address steeply rising costs of special education, includes $30 million each year for 2026 and 2027 for a new “special education expansion grant” for school districts based on the amount they receive through the state’s Education Cost Sharing formula. The $30 million for 2026 will be added to $221 million already in the budget for special education that year. 
The grant may be used either for expanding a district’s on-site special education services, or expanding “tier two” interventions in math and reading — academic or behavioral help that is offered in advance to special education. 
“We can all say that we have seen a large number of students that have gone through our school systems, that are not able to receive the supports that they need,” said Rep. Maryam Khan, D-Windsor, co-chair of the legislature’s Select Committee on Special Education. “Addressing this gap especially of providing special education dollars for districts to increase their capacity for serving students with special needs — it was essential in this legislation.” 
Khan introduced the legislation, H.B. 5001, on the House floor and spoke at length in its favor Thursday evening before representatives voted unanimously to support it. The bill will now go to the Senate for a vote.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, said she believed investing in these “tier two” supports would ultimately lower districts’ special education costs, because fewer children would need special education services.
“If we can catch kids from the Pre-K through 3, we can kind of stop that train. We can give them the help that they need when they’re younger,” said Nuccio. 
Many school districts pay private providers to educate students with special needs. Khan said the additional state funding should make it possible for districts to offer more of that support directly. “We want districts to be able to expand their services in-house and provide what they can in their school buildings as much as possible,” Rep. Maryam Khan, D-Windsor, said during a press conference on Thursday. 
The bill also raises the age by which a child can be diagnosed with a developmental delay from age 5 to age 8. Khan said developmental delays often go undiagnosed before the age of five, meaning many children go without needed services.
A large part of the bill seeks to expand regulation of private special education providers. It requires the State Department of Education to set a rate schedule — to be reviewed every two years — limiting how much providers can charge for services, including speech, behavioral and occupational therapies. It also prohibits private special education institutions from raising rates in the middle of the school year. 
Rep. Tina Courpas, R-Greenwich, said Republicans were in support of the rate setting for private providers, but said it was a “complicated thing” that they wanted to make sure was correct. “ We also want to get it right so that we don’t drive any provider to special ed services out of Connecticut’s market. We want it to be a robust market,” she said. 
Rep. Amy Romano, R-Shelton, said she was conflicted about the idea of rate setting. While she agreed that the high cost of special education needed to be addressed, she was worried that private programs might respond by increasing class sizes, and that it could mean a loss of teachers and providers. 
Khan said the State Department of Education was already regulating rates for four residential programs in Connecticut. “ They’ve done it for many years and we’ve never had any concerns from those four programs, and they’ve done that effectively and those programs have thrived,” she said. 
Khan also said that other states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts set rates for private providers. And she said the state legislature would have final approval over the rates that would be set. 
The bill also calls for the State Department of Education to conduct random surprise visits at private special education institutions. If the department identifies problems, the school would have 30 days to correct the problems or be subject to a fine. It also requires school districts to written contracts with providers, and it adds reporting requirements for the private providers. 
Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, said she was concerned about the State Department of Education’s ability to conduct the audits, since the state has 113 approved special education programs. 
Khan said the bill included $5 million to assist the department by providing several additional staff members as recommended by the State Department of Education. 
The department declined to comment for this story.
Growing needs
Andy Feinstein, a special education attorney and a co-chair of the state’s Task Force to Study Special Education Services and Funding, said earlier this year that the cost of special education outplacements to private providers had “skyrocketed.” From 2023 to 2024, excess costs for special education rose 25%, and they’re estimated to have risen an additional 11% in 2025. 
The number of children in special education has also increased. In 2025, more than 18% of students across the state have special education needs. 
“We have a situation where the costs are going up and we want to and need to fulfill these children’s needs, and yet the burdens that are being put on the school districts to fund those is becoming untenable,” Courpas told lawmakers on Thursday. 
In March, the legislature voted to send $40 million in emergency funding to the local school districts for the current school year. 
Governor Ned Lamont had proposed $40 million in special education funding for districts in 2027, and the legislature’s budget committee added $40 million in 2026 as well. 
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, told reporters on Thursday that the bill, while “not transformative” was “ moving the ball down the field in the right direction.” 
Under the legislation, a commission already tasked with studying education funding would take up several additional topics, including studying whether the state has enough programs to meet current demand, how lower-level interventions are being used in school districts, the possibility of a “peer review” allowing districts to model one another’s programs and respite care. 
It is also charged with offering recommendations on the best way to measure whether the special education programs in districts were meeting performance standards. 
Courpas said Republicans were particularly proud of the measurements around student performance that they’d placed in the bill. 
“ To us, the most important question is, are we serving the kids of Connecticut? Are we doing well by them? Are we providing effective special ed services?” she said. 
And the bill also prescribes an analysis into the workload of special education workers in the state — a response, Khan said, to reports she’d heard about teachers facing increased paperwork and high rates of burnout. She noted that half of special education teachers left the education field within five years. 
“We felt that it would properly address the workload that is put on special education staff so that we can retain our staff,” said Khan.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0529_SR_Session_167-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 00:00:59.742356
