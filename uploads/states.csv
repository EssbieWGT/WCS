Many organizations that feed families, house the homeless, mentor children, and care for the most vulnerable in our communities have had to scale back their programs after critical federal support was cut.
In October, the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance released a survey of 72 nonprofit organizations. Of that group, 33 percent reported federal funding loss or delay in federal funding, and 44 percent said they had to reduce or eliminate their programs as a result. These nonprofits are the front line of Connecticut’s social safety net. When one falls behind, the ripple effect is felt across schools, hospitals and neighborhoods. That strain is only growing as federal funding shrinks and demand for services continues to rise.
National data from earlier this year paint the same picture. Most nonprofits can’t cover their full operating costs without the support of government funding. Without their financial support, somewhere between 60 to 80 percent of nonprofits in each state would be operating in the red.
Nonprofits have long been critical partners in meeting community needs. But they can’t carry the burden alone when the foundation beneath them has shifted. Here in Connecticut, the sudden loss or freeze of federal funds has left organizations scrambling. Food banks, domestic violence shelters and community clinics have reported scaling back their services or delaying programs, leaving the people who rely on them the most without the support they need.

That impact hits home. Frontline staff and volunteers have no choice but to stretch limited resources to meet the growing community needs. I think about all the parents waiting for a hot meal for their children, seniors relying on a clinic and families seeking shelter. When nonprofits are forced to cut back, people feel the consequences immediately and deeply.

My career in philanthropy has been dedicated to making generosity more accessible, smarter and impactful. From co-founding a global education nonprofit to creating early online giving platforms and now launching Charity Bridge Fund, I’ve seen how connecting donors to real-time needs can make a significant difference. The goal is simple: make sure nonprofits that are struggling receive the support they need to ensure they can continue to serve their communities. 
Charity Bridge Fund is a new initiative designed to help donors stay informed on the impacts of the widespread loss of federal funding. For decades, the federal government helped safeguard many of our country’s basic needs, supporting food access, housing stability, education and community health. With recent reductions in federal funding, many of these essential needs are now at risk, reminding us that private giving must also help sustain the core services that keep our communities strong. 
This initiative raises awareness of the urgent needs created by loss of funds, offering a list of affected projects by cause and geography, insight into the short-term impact of sudden decreased funds, and the long-term societal risk of losing critical social programs. 
As we work to protect this vital network, it’s important to understand what these changes look like on the ground. We invite nonprofits to share their stories on the platform, detailing how these cuts have impacted their work. Doing so provides access to matching dollars and opportunities for broader visibility, helping elevate their voices and drive meaningful action.
The safety net only works when every part holds together. Our local nonprofits have carried us through recessions, pandemics and policy shifts. Today, many of them are at risk. If we want them to survive, we must act now. Every donation, step of support and connection made today helps protect the people in our community tomorrow. 
Connecticut’s nonprofits are holding the line. It’s time for us to ensure they have the support they need.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Craig Richards, a longtime member of the board in charge of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, has been replaced.
On Monday afternoon, Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced he had selected Ralph Samuels, a former state legislator, businessman and tourism expert, to serve on the board in a public seat formerly occupied by Richards, whose term was slated to expire this year.
The board directs Alaska’s $85 billion Permanent Fund, whose investments are the source of more than 60% of the state’s general-purpose revenue. That money is used annually for services and the annual Permanent Fund dividend.
Richards had served on the board since 2015, first under then-Gov. Bill Walker, and then under Dunleavy, who appointed him to a four-year term as a public member of the board in 2021. 
Richards did not immediately answer a message left on his cellphone. It was not immediately clear whether he had sought another term but was passed over by the governor.
Samuels also did not immediately answer a message left on his cellphone.
A statement announcing Samuels’ appointment did not include a comment from Richards or note his departure.
Of Samuels, the governor said, “He is a lifelong Alaskan with an innate understanding of our state’s business and political landscape. As a Trustee he will bring that experience and insight to managing Alaska’s sovereign wealth fund not only for today, but for future generations of Alaskans.”
Under Richards, who chaired the Board of Trustees from 2018 through 2022, the board launched a controversial in-state investment program that has yet to deliver positive results. 
The board in recent years has also intensified its warnings about the threat that the fund may run out of spendable money in the coming years. 
An analysis paper commissioned during Richards’ time on the board suggests that a constitutional amendment may be needed to change the Permanent Fund’s structure to firmly cap the amount of money that may be spent from the fund and to consolidate the fund’s current two-account structure.

The justices Monday said a lower court should not have overturned a Prince George's County man's conviction in a 2010 fatal shooting. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal appeals court was wrong when it ordered a new trial for Jeremiah Antoine Sweeney, who was convicted of second-degree murder for an April 2010 shooting in Prince George’s County, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday.
In a unanimous, unsigned ruling, the justices reversed the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which the high court said had wrongly ruled for Sweeney based on a claim that he “never asserted” in his appeal.
The justices wrote that Sweeney made “one, and only one claim” in his appeal — that his attorney at his trial was ineffective. His attorney put on no witnesses or evidence, and failed to question jurors to see if they had been influenced by one juror who made an unauthorized visit to the crime scene.
“Instead of ruling on that claim, the Fourth Circuit devised a new one, based on a ‘combination of extraordinary failures from juror to judge to attorney,’” the high court said in its ruling. “The Fourth Circuit’s ‘radical transformation’ of Sweeney’s simple ineffective-assistance claim ‘departed so drastically from the principle of party presentation as to constitute an abuse of discretion.’”
Attar, co-defendants plead not guilty in alleged blackmailing scheme

The justices wrote in their brief, four-page ruling that “’the parties frame the issues for decision,’ while the court serves as ‘neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.’” It sent the case back to the circuit court with instructions to reconsider Sweeney’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim only, in light of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which severely limits relief on appeal.
The Maryland Office of the Attorney General, which represented Prince George’s County in the case, declined to comment Monday on the high court’s ruling.
Jo-Ann Tamila Sagar, listed as an attorney for Sweeney, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A Prince George’s jury found Sweeney guilty in 2011 of second-degree murder, attempted murder and weapons violations in a 2010 shooting during an argument over stolen marijuana, that ended up killing a bystander 75 yards away. He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms, plus 30 years.
Sweeney’s state court appeals were rejected, and his first post-conviction appeal to the federal system — claiming ineffective assistance of counsel — was turned down at the district court level.
But a divided three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit disagreed in March, ruling that Sweeney deserved a new trial.
Circuit Judge Roger Gregory, in a 46-page opinion joined by Judge Terence W. Boyle, wrote that the case was built entirely on eyewitnesses who identified Sweeney “as the shooter — late at night, on a crowded street,” where “vantage point was an issue; light was an issue,” and a murder weapon was never found.
When Juror No. 4 went to inspect the crime scene on his own, and then joined deliberations with the rest of jury before the judge was alerted, it threatened Sweeney’s right “to a fair and impartial jury, reaching a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom,” Gregory wrote. But he said Juror No. 4 was “just the tip of the iceberg.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Despite this, the judge allowed Juror No. 4 to return to the jury lounge with the other jurors for over an hour, with no instruction that they not deliberate,” according to the opinion. “After ultimately excusing Juror No. 4, the judge never instructed the remaining eleven jurors that they were not to consider anything Juror No. 4 had told them.”
“Judge and defense counsel both failed in their responsibilities. The trial court judge did not properly inquire into the jury taint” by Juror No. 4, he wrote, and Sweeney’s attorney “rendered representation far short of what is objectively reasonable.”
“The breakdown of the judicial process in this case – from juror to judge to attorney – deprived Sweeney of his constitutional rights, and he is therefore entitled to a new trial,” Gregory wrote.
But Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr., in a 50-page dissent, said that Sweeney raised only one claim in his appeal — not receiving competent representation at trial. Despite that, the majority “raises on its own, and then decides the case on, a totally different ground from what Sweeney argued to the state courts, to the district court or to us on appeal,” justifying its decision based on “the special circumstances” of Sweeney’s case.
“That alone is a problem. What’s the standard for this? It seems purely subjective. Like beauty, special  circumstances are in the eye of the beholder,” Quattlebaum wrote.
“We are not free to scour the record for issues that we think are important when the parties never raised them below and then dispense our subjective views of justice. That, however, is exactly what the majority does,” he wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC03528-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 22:56:53.302076

(Source: Waymo)Earlier this year, Montana passed a law allowing for the use of autonomous vehicles on the state’s roadways.
Part of the bill  — Senate Bill 67 —also gave the state’s Department of Transportation and Department of Justice some rulemaking authority over their use. 
“The intention of this legislation is to get all parties to the table to promote the safest ways to promote autonomous technology incorporating the diverse roadways, weather, and animal-human encounters in Montana and to make Montana the showcase for advancing new technologies in transportation,” the bill’s preamble states.
The Legislature’s interim transportation committee has taken up the issue as part of a study into mass transportation and sent state Sens. Russ Tempel and Denley Loge on a mission to Arizona to find out more about Waymo, an autonomous taxi service.
The pair spoke about the experience during the transportation committee meeting on Monday.
“When Senator Tempel ordered up the Waymo, a car pulled up with a little ball on top, and his initials were on it. That’s how we knew that was the one that was coming for him,” Loge, an St. Regis Republican, told the committee.
“It’s comparable to a taxi price, but it is impressive,” he added
They described that it changed speed limits appropriately, if fast (“It wasted no time,” Loge said) and that it turned corners well. It recognized a pickup truck pulling out in front and was able to change lanes without issue, they added.
Meetings with Waymo gave them an opportunity to see more of their business. Waymo officials were mum on the financial side of the business, but did describe the learning abilities of the software the cars run on. Essentially cars take photos of the route, learning curb heights and even if there’s a new pothole. They added that it seemed to perform well around pedestrians.
With emerging obstacles like a pothole, the car will download that information when it gets back and the other cars will now have the knowledge of the pothole as well.
“There was one instance there was a car backing out of a parking spot. It waited till that car got backed out, and then it took that spot to go into the charger,” Loge said. “And I asked the guys, I said, is it like milk cows? They go back to the same stall? And they said, ‘No, they talk to each other, and whatever stall is open, they go to, and if somebody’s backing out, it waits, or it backs up, if it has to.’ It’s pretty incredible.”
The committee did have some questions, including on animal collisions and road conditions. Part of SB 67 gives the Department of Transportation some authority over that matter, including limiting autonomous vehicles in certain situations, but also allows the department the ability to exempt them as well. 
“The Department of Transportation may exempt from limitation commercial vehicles with an automated driving system that are demonstrated to be capable of operating safely during dangerous road conditions,” the bill reads.The company is testing their vehicles in Buffalo, New York, though has been mostly limited to southern markets, they said.
The Department of Justice has some authority, too.
“The Department of Justice shall consult interested stakeholders prior to proposing rules on vehicles with an automated driving system, such as members of the transportation interim committee and representatives of law enforcement agencies, motor vehicle and insurance industries, drivers, pedestrians, and tribal and local governments.”
The lawmakers also got some advice on rulemaking from the mayor of Mesa, who said part of the reason Waymo came to the city was because they didn’t put any restrictions up.
“One thing he mentioned was, ‘Be careful putting any restrictions on these things until they work through it and explain to you what they’re capable of,’” said Tempel, a Chester Republican.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WAYMO-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 21:57:20.416623

Ned Lamont’s reelection kickoff found  Connecticut voters give him a solid approval rating, but a significant minority are “indifferent or neutral” about him serving a third term.
A Nutmeg State Poll released Monday by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found voters approve of his performance by a margin of 55% to 38%, a net approval rating of +17, virtually unchanged since September.
Lamont’s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, barely made an impression among likely Democratic voters after four months of campaigning. Nearly 80% had no opinion of him, while 69% had a favorable opinion of the two-term governor.
If a Democratic primary were held today, the poll found Lamont outpolling Elliott, 55% to 7%, with 37% undecided and 2% saying they would write in someone else.
The data released Monday offered no matchups between Lamont and either of the two Republican candidates, Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich or former Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain.
Overall, 34% of voters were enthusiastic (11%) or satisfied (23%) about Lamont’s candidacy for a third term, while 31% were dissatisfied (21%) or angry (10%), 28% indifferent or neutral, and 6% unsure. 
Among Democratic voters, the poll found little evidence of the dissatisfaction that liberal Democratic lawmakers have expressed about Lamont over his refusal to embrace a more progressive tax code or higher spending.
Eighty-seven percent of self-described liberals, 76% of progressives and 63% of moderates had favorable opinions of Lamont. Forty-eight percent of socialists had a favorable opinion, but only 15% of socialists were negative. 
Asked to name the most important problems facing Connecticut, the cost of living was named by 22%, following by taxes (18%), housing (15%), jobs and the economy (10%) and immigration (5%). Four percent mentioned national issues or the federal government.
The poll was conducted from Nov. 12 to 17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5% percent on questions posed to all voters and 6.5% on questions posed only to likely Democratic voters.

As urban Alaska’s electric utilities look to import natural gas to fill a looming supply gap, residents and businesses face a future surge in electricity and heating prices.
 




Some of the price increase is unavoidable: Importing gas will require expensive infrastructure, and those construction costs will be paid by consumers.
 




But observers of the state’s urban electric and gas utilities are now warning of an even more painful possibility: Customers could be charged tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars for work that may not benefit them.
 



Urban Alaska’s privately-owned gas utility, Enstar, hopes to bill its customers to reimburse a project developer’s study costs for one import project — even if the project isn’t built.
 


There’s also a risk that the region’s utilities could build two separate import projects to meet differing priorities and timelines when one project could be enough to meet demand.

“The ultimate horror show is we end up with two projects,” said Antony Scott, a former Alaska public utility regulator who now works as an analyst for a green energy organization, Renewable Energy Alaska Project. “If each project is going to cost a half a billion dollars and you have two of them, then we’re paying half a billion for no reason.”
Scott is personally skeptical that more than one import facility will ultimately be built given the substantial expense involved, and he thinks competition could be good for consumers as long as only one project emerges.
But for now, two separate projects are moving ahead.
Collaboration, then a split
One of the two projects is led by Harvest, an affiliate of the privately held oil and gas company Hilcorp.
Harvest’s project would repurpose a dormant liquefied natural gas export plant on the Kenai Peninsula so that it can receive cargoes of LNG shipped in from outside Alaska.
The retrofitting plan, according to utility studies and officials involved, could cost $500 million or more, and it has at least one major potential customer lined up: Anchorage’s cooperatively owned electric utility, Chugach Electric Association, which has endorsed the project. Harvest last week announced that it had finalized a deal to buy the plant from its previous owner for an undisclosed sum.

Meanwhile, Enstar, the natural gas utility, is working with another energy company, Glenfarne, on a separate project, also on the Kenai Peninsula.
That project would involve construction of new LNG imports infrastructure and, according to Enstar President John Sims, could also cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Urban Alaska’s other three electric utilities — one on the Kenai Peninsula, one in the Mat-Su north of Anchorage, and one in Fairbanks — could end up procuring imported gas from either project, though no formal agreements have been announced.
The parallel development efforts represent a significant split among urban Alaska’s utilities — which, according to regulators and watchdogs, also drove up costs for consumers by failing to coordinate when they spent $1.5 billion on new power plants and other infrastructure in recent years.

Sims acknowledged as much, and said he’d welcome intervention from regulators to encourage closer collaboration.
“It’s a mathematical certainty. All the load on the same project reduces the cost,” Sims said in an interview. “This isn’t the only example where utilities can’t work together and it’s cost ratepayers more.”
Chugach, Enstar and the other urban Alaska electric utilities had previously been studying import projects cooperatively in an Enstar-led working group they formed in 2022 in response to the impending gas shortage.
But then, earlier this year, Chugach effectively split off in its partnership with Harvest, according to Sims — who said in an interview that he was “very surprised” and only learned of that separate project when he heard a rumor about it the night before it was announced.
The announcement underscored an already tense relationship between Enstar and Hilcorp, the Harvest affiliate. The two companies had been feuding in court over the terms of an existing, unrelated natural gas supply contract.
Sims has said publicly that his company is not interested in participating in a project that could further consolidate the position of Hilcorp, which is currently urban Alaska’s dominant supplier to utilities of locally produced natural gas.
The Enstar-Glenfarne project, Sims said, would have the advantage of being what’s known as a “greenfield” facility — meaning it’s newly built — in contrast to the existing facilities that Harvest wants to repurpose.
“If you’re going to be spending half a billion dollars, I’d much rather do it on greenfield than something where I don’t know what I’m digging into,” he said.

A spokeswoman for Chugach, the Anchorage electric utility, said that the region’s dependence on Hilcorp is not inherently problematic and that the company has been an “excellent business partner.”
Chugach, said spokeswoman Julie Hasquet, is pursuing the retrofit because of how quickly the project can launch — as soon as 2026, according to Harvest. Chugach’s primary contract for locally produced natural gas ends in 2028, while the Enstar-Glenfarne project isn’t expected to come online until 2029 at the earliest.
“Our plans are not only the most cost-effective and closest to completion but are designed to be flexible, scalable and work with other long-term supply options to continue offering valuable service to Alaskans well into the future,” Harvest’s chief executive, Jason Rebrook, said in a prepared statement.
Sims said he thinks utilities could work together to stretch out scarce gas supplies so that Chugach could wait until the Glenfarne-Enstar project comes online.
No ‘blank check’ for Enstar
Some of Enstar’s customers, meanwhile, are raising concerns about what they describe as an unusual arrangement with Glenfarne that they say shifts risk to consumers.
Enstar, in filings with state utility regulators, said Glenfarne is expected to spend up to $48 million studying the project before making a final decision on whether to build it. If it’s not built, Enstar will still have to reimburse Glenfarne for those costs — and it aims to raise that money by billing its customers.
Residential consumers would see increases to their bills of $15 a month over the course of a year, Enstar said in its preliminary filing with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska in January.
That filing drew sharp objections from some watchdogs and consumers. One lawyer representing a pair of Anchorage commercial real estate firms wrote in a comment that Enstar “seeks to shield its shareholders from any risk associated with exploring the potential construction of a project that may never provide any benefit to ratepayers.”
“Speculative, non-regulated projects that Enstar wants to engage in are an Enstar shareholder and owner issue, not a ratepayer issue,” Robin Brena, a veteran energy lawyer and co-owner of one of the real estate firms, said in a phone interview.
The commission rejected Enstar’s request for preapproval to bill customers up to $48 million to pay Glenfarne, saying in a formal order that it would not give Enstar a “blank check.”
Commissioners did, however, say they would consider allowing Enstar to recover up to $42 million once the money is spent — if the company can show those expenses were reasonable, among other conditions.
A Glenfarne spokesman referred a request for comment to Enstar.

Jim Pillen said his team is ""working our tails off"" to ""make lemonade"" out of the sour announcement that the Lexington Tyson Foods plant is to close in January. Dec. 27, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska “got our butts kicked” by the Tyson Foods decision to close a Lexington beef plant employing about 3,200 people, Gov. Jim Pillen said Monday. But he sees a possible Hail Mary pass to resurrect the industrial property.
Pillen, in an interview with the Nebraska Examiner on the agribusiness closure, said he learned officially of Tyson’s decision Friday at noon, just a few hours before the Arkansas-based multinational corporation made the news public.

He said his team had been seeking a meeting with company officials amid the struggles faced by the cattle industry, including cutters and other meat processors facing lower cattle supplies and higher retail prices for beef. 
The governor said he was told a key contributor to Tyson’s decision involved the age and inefficiencies of the Lexington factory, which was built decades ago to manufacture combines and other farm machinery. 
The “good news,” Pillen said, is that Tyson officials are exploring other options for the Lexington property, including repurposing it into a specialty, “value-added” agricultural operation akin to Tyson’s Omaha plant that produces millions of pounds of raw and cooked bacon. 
 Specialty meat operation? 

His hope, he said, is that the company might take a cattle carcass, for example, Pillen said, and create a specific type of steak or other commodity and make something people want, as does Tyson’s Omaha plant. 
“There [are] discussions going on within the Tyson organization, ‘How can we turn that plant into a value-added plant with either pork, beef or poultry because they’re in that space. That’s a real-life possibility,” Pillen said.
Tyson Foods did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The governor harkened back to the origins of the Lexington Tyson plant. It was built originally to manufacture farm implements for Sperry-New Holland, which during the farm crisis in 1985 announced it would close and eliminate 940 jobs.
IBP in 1990 opened the property as a converted meatpacking facility. The company later was acquired by Tyson Foods, doing pivotal work for ranchers in west-central Nebraska. Pillen said the plant might have survived this round of Tyson cuts had it been tailor-made for beef production.
“My guess would be that if that plant would have been built brand new from scratch, this is a conversation that wouldn’t be taking place,” Pillen said. “They took lemons after New Holland and made lemonade out of it for a while. But as it got really, really competitive, [and] it’s not really one of the best plants in the United States.”
Asked whether workforce availability problems influenced Tyson — including limited availability of temporary foreign workers and immigrants who have staffed many of the cutting-floor jobs — Pillen said he was told the Lexington plant had a “great team,” which “made it extra hard.”
“Tyson wants to turn it into something because … when you have a great team of people, the last thing you want to do is walk.”
 ‘Lived this nightmare before’ 

Nebraska’s congressional representatives have taken a harder line on the closing than Pillen, who defended Tyson as an American-owned meat-processing, protein provider. He has said he is not an advocate of foreign-owned businesses crowding the food space.

Pillen’s family runs a massive hog and hog genetics operation based in Columbus, and his family has a significant ownership stake in a pork-production plant in Fremont. He said his family has long done business with Tyson’s plant in Madison. The company also has a major plant in Dakota City.
U.S. Rep Mike Flood, R-Neb, said in a video on social media that “we’ve lived this nightmare before,” when Tyson pulled out of Norfolk nearly 20 years ago.
He said the Tyson decision for Lexington “brought a lot of emotion back.” In 2006, he was a new state senator representing Norfolk when he said he got a call that the Norfolk plant would close and eliminate 1,300 jobs.
He showed a video of the abandoned Tyson plant in Norfolk and asked Tyson to help resurrect the Lexington facility in some way, even if for another company.
“We can do this much better,” he said. He also said, “There is life after Tyson,” adding that he worked with a local hospital in his northeast Nebraska town to build a nursing school. He said it helped create a “regional medical destination” with a health service system he called “unparalleled for a town our size.”
He said his city’s downtown has since seen major revitalization projects. 
 ‘Dude ranch’ fascination

Pillen acknowledged Tyson’s presence in other communities, saying,  “I think it’s incredibly important we’re focused on what we have.”
He said the state and its agricultural-focused economy cannot afford to feel sorry for itself. 
“What are we going to do?” he asked. “Wallow in the muck  … or are we going to roll up our sleeves and try to solve something?” He said he has spent much of his time since Friday “calling people and getting input” on next steps.

He said he has been privy to conversations about what it would take for the new Sustainable Beef in the North Platte area to take on a second shift  — perhaps opening slots earlier than anticipated for some Lexington-based workers. 
The Lexington plant is to close around Jan. 20. 
Pillen said one of the easiest, short-term ways to help might be to bus or transport former Lexington plant workers to the North Platte plant. He said Sustainable Beef already has hired many of their first 800 workers and a chunk was from Lexington. 
“So that transfer has been taking place,” he said. “We’re talking to people on all fronts to be able to get ideas and bring people together.” 
Pillen, Nebraska’s first farmer-governor in more than a century, talked about reasons behind the U.S. cattle shortage that has impacted meatpacking companies and processors. 
Among factors reducing the heads of cattle being raised, Pillen said, are extended drought conditions that shrank “mama cow herds” and bad winters that hurt cattle conception rates. He said the 2023 winter reduced herds and births by more than 300,000 cattle in Nebraska alone. 
Also, he said much ranch land is being gobbled up by rich people that prefer operating a “dude ranch” over raising cattle, which has contributed.
 ‘Gotta make lemonade’ 

Pillen said the number of jobs eliminated by Tyson may be lower than the 3,200 the company reported because of fewer shifts being run during tight times. But he called the loss devastating to a community of about 11,000 people in Dawson County. 
He urged Nebraskans to consider donating to charitable organizations, including local churches and civic groups trying to gather help for affected workers and their families over the holiday season.
He said Tyson didn’t ask for state incentives or other changes to keep the Lexington plant open. He said ag producers and industrial users are more interested in lasting property tax relief.
Tyson’s cuts stretched beyond Nebraska’s Lexington plant, which slaughtered up to 5,000 cattle a day, according to industry reports. The company said it was also downsizing a Texas beef plant to a single shift each day from two.
“We’re working our tails off,” Pillen said of his team. “This was a bad lemon drop day. But we gotta make lemonade out of it.”

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Facing a significant projected budget deficit, Idaho lawmakers will have major spending and cutting decisions to make during the upcoming legislative session, Gov. Brad Little said Monday, though he remained seemingly optimistic.
Little, during an Idaho AARP telephone town hall, addressed questions regarding education, health care, immigration, and other issues. 
“There’s going to be some significant decisions that the Legislature is going to make this year, but I would project that generally, the state will continue with their upward trajectory,” Little said. “Right now, we’ve already had to dial back spending a little bit, mainly to compensate for some of the tax bills that we did in previous years and the (federal) Great Big Beautiful Bill is going to have another impact.” 
A recent Idaho Fiscal Policy Center report found that tax cuts over the past five years have reduced the state’s revenue by $4 billion since 2021, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
New report shows 5 years of Idaho income tax cuts have reduced state revenue by $4 billion

The projected budget deficit for the current fiscal year is $58.4 million, the Sun previously reported. The projection does not include the impact of the federal tax and spending budget package, or “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which could result in an additional $284.4 million reduction in annual revenue, according to an analysis by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy.  
The budget shortfall is estimated to increase over time, with one scenario shared with state budget committee members this month showing a potential $555.2 million deficit for fiscal year 2027.
Little said that about 22% of the state’s general fund is set aside in a rainy day fund for emergency use. 
“I don’t think it’s raining. I think there’s some clouds out there, but I don’t think it’s raining,” he said. “… our ethos in Idaho is, don’t spend money we don’t have, save for a rainy day, be prudent about it, don’t grow government too much, and that’s what we’ll continue to do going forward.” 
 Little: Private school choice tax credit unlikely to increase this year

Two callers questioned the governor about the school choice tax credit approved in 2025, which set aside $50 million for a $5,000 per student credit that could go toward education expenses, including private school tuition. House Bill 93 allows families with incomes at or below 300% of the federal poverty level to receive the money in an advance payment rather than reimbursement later. 
One caller questioned why Little signed the bill when more than 86% of those who contacted his office about the bill asked him to veto it, Idaho Education News reported
A Twin Falls resident asked, “Would you at least veto any increase, even if you won’t do anything about what you signed already?” 
Little responded that he would “be very surprised” if the Legislature added money to the program, because it’s still in its infancy. 
“We haven’t even started it yet, we’re just getting the rules in place to see how it works,” he said. 
He also said he signed the bill because he proposed school choice legislation in his 2025 State of the State Address, and said the bill met enough of his requirements to be “contained” and “means-tested,” or targeted only at certain income groups. 
The bill in its first year prioritizes families at or below the 300% poverty level, which for a family of four is an annual income of $96,450. However, in the later years, it prioritizes families who have previously received it. 
He also received a question about the accountability guidelines in the legislation and not being “as stringent” as they are for public schools. The requirements under the bill include that the money goes to K-12 education “that includes, at a minimum, English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies,” according to the bill language. 
Little said the regulations on public K-12 schools are overly burdensome. 
“I, frankly, think we ought to look at the rules we have for public schools and make them more akin to charter schools,” he said. “I’m all for that.”

 Medicaid may face further cuts 

A St. Anthony resident, who said she had a child with autism and owned an agency that provided services to people with disabilities, questioned Little about the recent 4% cut to provider reimbursement rates for those who serve Medicaid patients. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced the cuts in August, a week after Little directed state agencies to cut mid-year budgets by 3% in response to the projected budget shortfall.

Little said that the budget for the program had grown too much. 
“As I look forward to Medicaid funding this coming year, it’s going to be a challenge again,” he said. “The bottom line is, the growth in Medicaid, both at the federal level and the state level, has been so large that it was just a matter of either terminating the program … or basically, dialing back the level of it so that my Medicaid budget balances, and we can live within the means we have there.” 
He noted there’s “not going to be a lot of new money this year,” and that the state was awaiting decision making by Congress regarding health care premium tax credits, which help keep insurance premium costs lower for private insurance purchased through the state marketplace and are set to expire this year. 
The congressional tax and spending megabill also included reductions in federal Medicaid spending of around $1 trillion over the decade. 
 Some lawmakers hope to address women’s health care shortage

A Lewiston resident said his adult children had moved out of Idaho because of a lack of job opportunities and because of Idaho’s strict felony abortion ban. 
“It’s just not reasonable or logical that they can’t be treated for miscarriage in Idaho, if they have severe complications of pregnancy, they have to go out of state to get treatment,” the caller said. 
Idaho’s law makes it a felony to provide an abortion in almost all cases except to remove a dead fetus, treat a molar pregnancy, prevent the death of the mother, and narrow circumstances involving rape and incest if a police report is provided in the first trimester. 
A study published this year found that Idaho lost more than a third of its practicing obstetrician providers since the state’s abortion ban went into effect, the Sun reported. 
Some Republican state lawmakers, including Rep. Mark Sauter, R-Coeur d’Alene, and Sen. Jim Woodward in the 2025 session, introduced legislation to add an exemption to the ban to protect the health of the mother, rather than prevent her death. None of the bills have received public hearings. 
Little noted that women’s health has been an issue discussed since the bill went into effect upon the U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022. 
He said there are “well-meaning people that are talking about some changes to that legislation.” 
“Idaho is never going to be a place where it’s a preferred place for abortions. That’s my position. That’s position the most Idaho,” he said. “But we want women’s health to be available at the highest level.” 
 Four ICE agents in Idaho, Little says 

A caller asked about immigration enforcement in Idaho, as it has escalated nationwide. 
Little said there are four federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents in Idaho. 
The governor noted that the Idaho State Police has signed what’s called a 287(g) agreement with the  ICE. The state approved ISP to spend up to $300,000 from the governor’s emergency fund to transport undocumented people to ICE detention facilities for deportation. 
Little said Monday the program is focused on people who have been convicted of separate crimes. 
“After they go through their due process, rather than turning them back out on the street that they’re they’re sent to their home country,” he said. 
Through this agreement, the state has transported more than 50 people to ICE detention centers. An analysis of criminal records by the Idaho Capital Sun found that most but not all had had convictions in Idaho, with some being charged and transported before their cases completed and a couple who had faced charges that were later dismissed.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Nov. 20, 2025.
For the second time in just over a year, farm workers and immigrant rights advocates last Saturday staged protests at multiple Hannaford supermarket locations to pressure the regional grocery chain to guarantee better labor conditions for dairy workers.
Locally, protesters gathered outside the Hannaford in Morrisville’s Fairground Plaza on Nov. 15 to push the company and its multinational Dutch parent company, Ahold Delhaize, to participate in immigrant rights advocacy group Migrant Justice’s Milk with Dignity program.
The Milk with Dignity program asks participating corporations to pay more for dairy products to ensure better working conditions for workers on dairy farms. Vermont-based ice cream giant Ben & Jerry’s has participated in the program since 2017.

In October, Vermont Way Foods, a progressive distributor of Vermont products, announced a partnership to allow Migrant Justice to monitor working conditions in their products’ dairy supply chain, and even promoted the partnership with a “Cheese with Dignity” product.
In a survey conducted by Migrant Justice of Vermont farmworkers, over two-thirds of survey takers said they make less than minimum wage — in some cases far less — while another two-thirds reported suffering an injury due to working conditions.
Though Migrant Justice has targeted Hannaford in pressure campaigns to join Milk with Dignity since 2019, the campaign has escalated since protestors last appeared at the Morrisville location in October 2024.
In April, Migrant Justice filed a complaint with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international trade forum in which 37 countries develop policy around economic trade, alleging “grave human rights violations” in Hannaford’s dairy supply chain.
With Hannaford under greater pressure, protestors returned to Fairground Plaza Saturday, Nov. 15 with makeshift instruments, blaring music and chants in English and Spanish, handing out flyers to would-be shoppers and asking them to boycott the supermarket for a day.

Ahold Delhaize responded by commissioning an independent human rights investigation. Migrant Justice “recently hosted the investigators charged with looking into labor violations, connecting them with workers on farms supplying Hannaford-brand milk,” the group said in a website post promoting the Nov. 15 protests, as investigators return to the Netherlands to submit their report.
Representatives for Portland, Maine-based Hannaford grocery or Ahold Delhaize did not respond to requests for comment.
With Hannaford under greater pressure, protestors returned to Fairground Plaza on with makeshift instruments, blaring music and chants in English and Spanish, handing out flyers to would-be shoppers and asking them to boycott the supermarket for a day.
A farmworker employed on a farm that guarantees fair labor conditions as part of the Ben & Jerry’s supply chain and asked that his name be withheld due to concerns of retaliation said that he valued the working conditions guaranteed by the Milk with Dignity program compared to what he sees on other farms.
“I have a voice, and I know that I have rights,” he said in Spanish, according to Migrant Justice spokesperson Will Lambek, who acted as translator. “For example, if I get sick, I can take a day off and I’ll still be paid for it. For Hannaford supply chain workers, even if they get sick, they have to keep working.”
Hannaford responded with an increased security detail, employing not just private security guards as they had the previous year but also law enforcement with the Morristown Police Department and the Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department. Officers questioned anyone attempting to park in the Hannaford parking lot to ensure only customers were allowed.
Farmworkers and activists gathered publicly on Nov. 15 even as federal immigration detainment actions have become increasingly common, with nine people detained in Hardwick in September and another seven detained after a targeted raid at a gas station in Jeffersonville earlier this month.
Eight people were detained after an immigration police raid on a Franklin County dairy farm in April, and Jose Ignacio De La Cruz, an organizer with Migrant Justice, and his stepdaughter were detained after being pulled over on the road by the United States Border Patrol in Richford in June.
“We are here again, speaking up and demanding our rights, and there is a lot of risk to that,” the farmworker said. “We understand that, but if we were to let ourselves be conquered by our fear, that would be letting them win.”

Gianforte and USFS Lolo Forest Supervisor Ben Johnson holding the permit for the 2025 State Capitol Christmas Tree
Most years, the tallest Christmas tree harvested in Montana, as far as the Daily Montanan is aware, takes up residence under the Capitol rotunda in Helena for the holiday season, towering nearly three stories tall and adorned with more than 3,500 lights.
On Monday, as Gov. Greg Gianforte looked on, foresters felled this year’s Capitol Christmas tree in the Lolo National Forest.
Near Seeley Lake, a Good Neighbor Authority project between the state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and the U.S. Forest Service provided an active forest management site to harvest the Douglas Fir that will serve as the state’s Christmas tree, all while contributing to the health of the forest.
“Each year, it’s a privilege to bring a tree from our public lands into the state capitol for all to enjoy,” Gianforte said in a statement. “Through the Good Neighbor Authority, the State of Montana and the Forest Service work together to actively manage our forests and improve their health. This year’s tree is an example of the good work happening to reduce fire risk in Montana.”
A spokesperson for the governor’s office said they didn’t know how tall the Douglas Fir was, but will have a better idea once it’s installed in the rotunda.
The Capitol Christmas tree is selected from a different parcel of public land around the state each year. Similarly, the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., displays a Christmas tree harvested from a different National Forest each year. The last tree from Montana — a 79-foot tall Engelmann Spruce from the Kootenai National Forest — was selected in 2017.
This year, a 53-foot red fir named Silver Belle all the way from the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest in Nevada arrived in D.C. over the weekend to become the nation’s Capitol Christmas Tree.
Montana has a long history of producing commercial Christmas trees.
At its height in the middle of the last century, northwest Montana was shipping more than 4 million trees to homes around the country, earning the town of Eureka the nickname “Christmas Tree Capital of the World.”
Now, Montana doesn’t rank in the top 20 states for growing commercial trees, with just 6,338 cultivated trees harvested in 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
However, following the governor’s lead, Montanans are able to harvest trees from the state’s vast public lands — data that is not available from state or federal agencies — creating a tradition for many Montana families.
The 2025 State Capitol Christmas tree will displayed in the Capitol rotunda throughout the holiday season. The governor and first lady invite Montanans to join them at the Capitol for a tree lighting ceremony on Monday, Dec. 1, at 5 p.m.
The governor encourages Montanans to participate in the unique tradition of harvesting Christmas trees from public lands to benefit forest health and resiliency as well as improve wildlife habitat.
Cutting any trees on state trust land requires a permit from the local DNRC field office. The cost is $10 per tree. To find a local DNRC field office to secure a permit in person to harvest a Christmas tree, see the map here.
Montanans can also harvest trees from National Forest land with a $5 permit, though some restrictions on height and species apply to trees from federal land.
Forest Service permits can be obtained online by visiting recreation.gov and searching “Christmas tree” and the forest you plan to cut it from, i.e. “Flathead National Forest, Lolo National Forest.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image001-1-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-11-24 19:56:59.017689

She worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service until she lost her job as part of the Trump administration's reduction of the federal workforce. (Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)When 9-year-old Liz Renner visited the Gavins Point National Fish Hatchery in southeastern South Dakota with her grandfather, she was hooked.
In adulthood, she devoted more than a decade of education and work to understanding the intricacies of fish biology and conservation. Then, in May 2024, she was hired to work at the hatchery as a fish biologist and member of the Pallid Sturgeon Recovery Program, working to save the endangered species of fish.
“But it felt more like a nightmare at the end than a dream come true,” said the 31-year-old, originally from Crooks.


From insiders to ousted
This is the first of four stories about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


Renner was laid off in February under Department of Government Efficiency action, reinstated in March, and then offered and accepted a deferred resignation weeks later because she feared she’d be let go again later on. She was paid her federal wages through the end of September in exchange for her leaving her position.
“I finally felt like I could breathe after I left the hatchery for a second time,” Renner said. “It was a sense of relief that the roller coaster was done for me.”
Renner was one of about 154,000 federal employees who took buyouts — officially known as deferred resignations — offered by the Trump administration earlier this year as a way to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said recently that he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
Of the 45 probationary employees laid off in February in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Mountain-Prairie Region, which includes eight states, Renner said she was one of at least 25 who didn’t return, either because they were not reinstated after DOGE cut them or because they accepted a buyout. Probationary employees are recent hires, usually in the first year of their position. Their loss burdened remaining employees with larger workloads and a hectic summer, Renner heard from her former colleagues.
‘My trust in these institutions is forever shaken’
At this point, Renner is grateful she was able to stay in her field and in the Midwest. Many other former federal biologists are not as fortunate, she said.
Renner moved in with her grandmother in Lyons, South Dakota, and splits her time between there and Lincoln, Nebraska, as a post-doctoral fisheries biologist at the University of Nebraska.
Now she researches, teaches and mentors students, and warns them about what they face. Their most promising options, she tells them, are finding a program out of the country, working in private consulting or with nonprofits, or working in liberal states with legislatures that prioritize conservation funding. 
Due to federal workforce reductions, Renner said, those recent graduates may be competing for an entry-level or seasonal job against someone with a master’s degree or over 10 years of experience in the field. Other peers have left the fisheries field altogether.
Renner remains passionate about research to conserve, propagate and reintroduce threatened and endangered fish and improve water quality in the state. She plans to stay in the field and look at ways to accomplish her mission outside of the federal government.
“My trust in these institutions is forever shaken,” Renner said, adding that if federal cuts continue, “I don’t know what young person in good conscience could look at what’s happened and say, ‘I want to work for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.’”

Nate Blouin is jumping into the race for a newly drawn congressional district favoring Democrats.  
Blouin is running for Congress in 2026 instead of a second term in the Utah Senate because he wants to stand up to President Donald Trump and work on making housing more affordable, he told Utah News Dispatch Monday.
“People are having to decide between a mortgage or child care, and that’s unacceptable. We should be able to provide people in the richest country in the world with all of those opportunities,” Blouin said. 
Blouin, 36, said he believes Congress needs more representatives who are younger and understand what it’s like to navigate today’s economy with student debt. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

Earlier this month, a Utah judge rejected a map proposed by the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature, saying it did not comply with a 2018 voter-approved law establishing an independent redistricting process and neutral map-drawing criteria. 
The judge selected boundaries pitched by a coalition of voting rights groups and citizens, creating the state’s first Democratic-leaning district in 20 years. 
Blouin’s announcement this week follows those of former state Sen. Derek Kitchen, state lawmaker Katheen Riebe and former congressman Ben McAdams, all declaring a bid for the U.S. House seat ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
Blouin was elected to the state Senate in 2022 and represents parts of Sugar House, Millcreek, Murray, West Valley City and South Salt Lake. He said the entirety of his current district is contained in the new District 1.
“I know from these constituents that I’m standing up for the stuff that they — the values that they — believe in, and I’m going to keep doing that,” Blouin said. 
Outside of serving in Utah’s part-time Legislature, he is a communications strategy consultant working with clean energy and environmental groups.

The report said Iowa corn harvest, at 99% of acres harvested, is “virtually” complete. The national report shows the other top corn-producing states have on average just 4% left to harvest. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said farmers delivered a “significant crop” in 2025 despite “variable” weather conditions, disease and a challenging agricultural economy.  
“Strong production requires strong markets, and we will continue working to build and diversify demand at home, across the country and around the world,” Naig said in a statement.

According to the report, 67% of topsoil moisture and 66% of subsoil moisture across Iowa is adequate. South central Iowa has the driest soil conditions with about 60% of topsoil and subsoil short of moisture. 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan said the statewide average precipitation for the Nov. 17 through Nov. 23 reporting period was 0.20 inch. That means precipitation was about half of the normal of 0.43 inch.
Glisan said the statewide average temperature for the period at 43.8 degrees Fahrenheit was 6.1 degrees above the normal.
Will Cannon, a board member with Iowa Corn Growers Association and a farmer in Jasper County, said his harvest wrapped up in a “pretty typical timeframe” though he said almost everyone he has spoken to had a handful of fields with “disappointing yields.” 
Cannon said these fields were hit with disease, like southern corn rust, or seemed to reach maturity quickly but with small kernel sizes. His estimations, and conversations he’s had with other growers, point to the warm overnight temperatures as the crop matured as the cause. 
“I think about everybody’s got at least one or two fields that were like that this year,” Cannon said. 
He said marketing corn this season has been “interesting” because the lack of federal farm reports during the 43-day government shutdown this fall meant producers were “flying blind.” 
The latest crop production report from USDA estimated corn yields were at 186 bushels per acre nationally, though the report does not include October yields due to the shutdown. Cannon said he expects the next report will show lower yield figures that will help some farmers’ marketing strategies. 
“There’s going to be a lot of people paying attention to that report, because, in theory, that’ll probably be the most complete report we’ve gotten in many, many months,” Cannon said. 
Iowa Capital Dispatch spoke with Cannon in early October about ag trade uncertainty, in particular with China. 
Since then, China agreed to purchase U.S. soybeans and remove tariffs on agricultural commodities like corn. 
Cannon said from his perspective, there is still uncertainty in the market and a general unease about the farm economy. 
He said on the other hand, he has been encouraged by conversations and legislative efforts to address some of the “fundamental issues in farming” like consolidation and high input costs. 
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, both Republicans from Iowa, have introduced legislation known as the Fertilizer Research Act that would require a government study on consolidation and pricing in the fertilizer industry. 
Grassley additionally led a hearing in the Senate in late October about consolidation in the fertilizer and seed industries that he alleged are causing elevated input costs. 
“Whatever you want to call it right now, farmers are still incredibly concerned about what it’s costing to produce the crop, and what the price is right now,” Cannon said. “There’s still a tremendous amount of concern about what it’s going to cost for next year’s crop to produce it.”

Free school meal advocates in North Dakota are calling on the state Legislature to prioritize permanent funding to pay for meals. (Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakotans may have the chance to cast their ballot on whether every public school student in the state can have breakfast and lunch for free. 
Advocacy organization Together For School Meals plans to submit language for the potential ballot petition to the Secretary of State’s Office this week. 
If approved and the required 31,164 signatures for constitutional ballot measure are gathered, submitted and verified, the measure would appear on the 2026 general election ballot in November with the free meals beginning during the 2027-28 school year.
Robin Nelson, chair of the ballot petition’s sponsoring committee, said the effort to provide school meals to North Dakota students for free began with a small team of citizens in preparation for the 2021 legislative session. While legislative proposals have failed, she said polling shows it is popular with the public.

“We carefully brought it through the proper channels legislatively and, due to the high approval rating across the state of North Dakota, we weren’t going to stop if this is what our North Dakota citizens want,” Nelson said.
Free school lunches for all students received 79% support in a recent North Dakota United poll. In 2024, a poll by the North Dakota News Cooperative revealed 82% of those asked support more government involvement in providing school meals.
She also said the measure would affect every public school student in North Dakota and private and tribal schools can opt-in to the program.
Nelson is a school board member for Fargo Public Schools and the CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of the Red River Valley, but she said she will be working on the ballot petition as a private citizen.
During the 2025 legislative session, two bills were introduced that would have provided breakfast and lunch for every North Dakota student, attending public or private school, at no cost to the student. Both bills failed in the North Dakota House of Representatives, with some lawmakers citing a need to balance the state budget while others said a federal program was adequate.

In submitted testimony, Lynelle Johnson, director of child nutrition and food distribution programs for the Department of Public Instruction, said the department estimated the cost to provide a breakfast and lunch to every North Dakota student would be about $140 million for the current biennium.
In the funding estimate, Nelson said the measure relies on schools receiving 100% reimbursement from federal free or reduced meal programs. Federal programs provide free school meals to students with household incomes at, or below, 130% of the federal poverty level, and partial reimbursement for households below 185% the federal poverty level. 
Legislators have used state funding to slightly expand who qualifies for free and reduced meals. Earlier this year, legislators added about $7.3 million in state funding. With the change, a family of four with income of $72,000 a year qualifies for free school meals. 
If the measure passes next year, the petition would allow state lawmakers to fund the program how they see fit. However, if lawmakers don’t identify a funding source during the 2027 legislative session, language in the petition would require it to be funded from the Legacy Fund earnings. That fund also provides money for property tax relief through the primary residence tax credit.
Amy Jacobson, executive director of Prairie Action ND and member of the coalition, said when kids are fed, they are more productive in the classroom.
“This is something that will directly impact a family’s ability to have more money in their pocket book and be able to spend that on other necessary needs that they do have,” Jacobson said. “There is nothing better that North Dakotans could be investing in than our future, and that is our children.”

""And a claimant will need to present a claim demonstrating injuries and causation.""","The temporary FEMA disaster recovery center in Mora, pictured June 7, 2022, during the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. FEMA officials said on Nov. 21, 2025 that those seeking compensation for recent well contamination will need to first prove “injuries and causation.” (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Officials with the federal claims office overseeing a multi-billion-dollar compensation fund for New Mexico’s Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims told Source New Mexico they will consider paying to address newly found well contamination, but only if victims first prove “injuries and causation.”
A recent independent geologic study discovered high levels of heavy metals in several dozen private wells in Mora County, findings the study’s author attributed to fire suppressants firefighters used in battling the 534-square-mile wildfire that raged for several months in spring and summer 2022. 
Geologist Kate Zeigler’s report — which documented elevated levels of metals like antimony, manganese and uranium beyond federal safe drinking water limits — also prompted the state Health Department to issue a health alert, warning families using the wells to drink bottled water and citing fire suppressants as a potential source for the contamination. Other state and local agencies have also since stepped in to donate pallets of bottled water to the area. 
Meanwhile, some Mora County residents and U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) have called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to use some of roughly $2 billion remaining in a compensation fund it oversees to help address the issue. The FEMA claims office responded Friday afternoon with answers to Source New Mexico’s questions about whether it will award compensation for claims for the latest contamination. 
New Mexico officials, Mora residents say feds should respond to groundwater contamination

Officials wrote in an unsigned statement that, “FEMA does not make determinations related to recent reports of heavy metals in drinking water in Northern New Mexico” and that the office “is not authorized to conduct studies of potential damages caused by the fire.”
Still, the statement said the office would consider claims individuals and households bring regarding contamination.
“Heavy metals caused by the fire can be compensable, and a claimant will need to present a claim demonstrating injuries and causation,” officials said in the statement.
Congress awarded FEMA $5.45 billion with the aim of “fully compensating” victims of the wildfire, which resulted from two botched prescribed burns on federal land in early 2022. In addition to burned property and smoke damage, the fire also caused widespread floods and debris flows, known as “cascading events,” for which the office has also agreed to pay. 
According to the latest figures, the office has paid about $3.24 billion in compensation. 
In an emailed statement to Source on Monday afternoon, Leger Fernández called on FEMA to quickly establish a process to address the heavy metal contaminants “rather than being dismissive.” 
“The office can and should create a protocol to quickly address these claims, similar to what they have done in other instances of loss,” she said.
Given that she helped draft and pass the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act, which created the compensation fund, Leger Fernández said she knows the bill’s legislative intent, which is to pay for the fire, as well as flooding and other ensuing harms. 
NM officials issue warning over high metals in Mora County groundwater

“The cascading events from the fire, including the flooding and now the water contamination, must be compensated,” she said. “Given that water is essential to life, these claims must be processed as expeditiously as possible.”
Paula Garcia, a lifelong Mora resident and director of the New Mexico Acequia Association, said the agency needs to be more proactive to deal with the latest environmental threat the fire caused. 
“The claims office should make a determination based on available data that the fire retardant drops caused elevated levels of heavy metal in our water. They don’t have to do their own study, she told Source. “It is within their power to make a determination on existing data on causation.”
She said she’s also unsure how claimants can prove “injury,” at least while compensation is still available through the fund. 
“Heavy metals have long-term impacts. I don’t see how an individual could demonstrate injury. Making people demonstrate injury and causation is a way to weed people out,” she said. 
According to the Health Department, prolonged or high-concentration exposure to the metals can damage kidneys and the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Infants, young children and pregnant people are the most sensitive, particularly to arsenic and manganese, which can affect brain development and cause other health effects. 
In the statement, the claims office noted that if a connection between the fire and the contamination is proved, the office would reimburse claimants, and encouraged people to contact claims office navigators to work on reopening or adding to their damage claims.
The statement also declined to respond to recent criticism from Leger Fernández and other members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation about the office’s treatment of “cascading event” claims. In a Nov. 6 letter, the delegation said FEMA was not acting quickly enough or at all on claims for new flooding damage. 
The statement provided to Source said FEMA does not comment publicly on its responses to congressional inquiries, but officials noted that claims can be reopened in some cases. 
“However, not all issues that arise from after the fire are caused by the fire, and in some cases requests for additional compensation have been found ineligible,” the statement reads.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_5381-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

(Photo via FWC)Florida’s first bear hunt in a decade will take place as scheduled next month after a state judge on Monday denied a motion by a conservation group to stop it from taking place.
Leon County Circuit Judge Angela Dempsey denied the temporary preliminary injunction sought by Bear Warriors United, which argued the hunt authorization was based on outdated data and will harm the bear population in Florida — right now estimated at around 4,050.
The group filed a lawsuit in September seeking to stop the 23-day hunt, after it was approved by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) in August and is scheduled to take place from Dec. 6 to Dec. 28.
“I’m going to find here that the plaintiff has not met their burden on substantial likelihood of success on the merits,” Judge Dempsey said at the end of a two-and-half-hour hearing that took place via Zoom on Monday.
“The 2015 hunt was found constitutional under the rational basis test and this hunt is significantly more conservative than that hunt in 2015, both in number of bears that could be harvested as well as the timing, when it’s a little less likely for more female bears to be killed.”
Supporters of the hunt point to increased interactions between bears and humans and consequent fears of attacks.
Questions about the data
Bear Warriors United contended the FWC was relying on “stale and outdated” data to reach the conclusion that the best way to manage the black bear population in Florida was a regulated hunt.
The most dramatic part of the hearing was an exchange between Thomas Crapps, attorney for Bear Warriors United, and FWC bear management coordinator Mike Orlando. Crapps asked Orlando at one point whether it “wouldn’t be more prudent to wait to get that information to decide whether or not a hunt was appropriate, based on more current data?”
“Actually, the science that we have now is actually very good data and, as those population estimates come in over time, we have the ability to actually adjust harvest rates and other things. But no, the population estimates that we’re working with right now are fantastic,” Orlando responded. “It’s good science.”
Orlando said that it takes up to two years for FWC to conduct a population study. That prompted Crapps to ask him why not wait to get more current data before making such an important decision?
“Because we will never have new data. It will always be old,” Orlando said. “So, what we’re doing again is taking a very conservative estimate approach to the hunting season, using the best available science that we have and, any new science that comes in, we will make adjustments. We have to be adaptive. That’s management 101.”
This will be the first bear hunt in Florida since 2015, when the hunt was shut down at the end of its second day after nearly 300 bears had been killed.
The bears are spread out across the state in seven areas known as Bear Management Units by the FWC. In justifying the hunt, the agency has said that, since 2015, the four largest subpopulations of bears have grown annually, and no subpopulations have shown evidence of decline.
Plan calls for removal of 172 bears in four ‘hunting zones’
The plan now allows for the removal of 172 bears from four “bear hunting zones” — 68 in the East Panhandle; 31 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in the South hunting area.
To participate, individuals must have been at least 18 years old by Oct. 1 and hold a hunting license and a bear harvest permit. Bear harvest permits cost $100 for Florida residents and $300 for non-residents and are not transferable. It cost $5 to submit an application, and there was no limit on how many applications individuals could submit.
However, not all of those who have received a permit will use it to kill a bear.
News 6 WKMG in Orlando reports that 44 people selected for the bear hunt are against killing bears. “By the time it’s all over with, we’ve got at least 52 of the 172, which will reduce the number of bears killed down to about 120 or less,” said Chuck O’Neal, president of Speak Up for Wildlife.
In his closing statement representing Bear Warriors United, Crapps noted that agency staff presented the first report on the Florida Black Bear Management Plan in December 2024 with a recommendation that no immediate action was needed.
“And it’s the FWC commissioners then direct them to have a hunt,” he said. “At that point, the science is being driven by the politics. And that is wrong.”
Not true, argued attorney Rhonda Parnell, representing the FWC.
“The science is sound,” she said. “Bears have always been a game animal. This hunt is no different than any other hunt, whether it is deer, turkey, quail, etc. We are the ones who get to make that determination. It is not for the court to say, ‘Well, you can determine deer hunting, but you can’t determine bear hunting.’ That would be an impermissible ruling by this court.”
Litigation will continue, as Judge Dempsey declined FWC’s request to dismiss the lawsuit. A hearing on that motion will take place on Dec. 15 — halfway through the bear hunt.
In a survey conducted by the FWC of more than 13,000 self-selected participants, 75% opposed the proposal, with just 23% in support. Other polls, such as a Remington Research survey commissioned by the Humane World for Animals, showed that 81% of Florida residents oppose the reopening of bear-hunting season.

About a decade ago, Ferguson, then Washington’s attorney general, chose her to lead his office’s new civil rights unit devoted to investigating and enforcing anti-discrimination laws.
On Monday, Ferguson, now governor, named Melody as Washington’s newest state Supreme Court justice.
Melody, 43, will succeed Justice Mary Yu, who announced her retirement in September. 
“Anyone who has had any interaction with Colleen in a legal setting would all agree that she has a brilliant legal mind,” Ferguson said at a news conference in the Supreme Court chambers at the Temple of Justice in Olympia. 
Melody said “the toughest question” in the hiring process was why she wanted to leave a job she so enjoyed.
“I never dreamt of being a judge,” she said. She added that working the past decade with individuals and juries, and in courthouses across the state, incited the desire.
Though the U.S. Supreme Court and federal courts are in the headlines, “state courts are actually the place where most of us who are able to access justice go to seek it,” Melody said, adding that they have “never been more important than they are right now.”
Yu will leave the court at the end of the year. An election will be held next year to complete the remainder of Yu’s term, which runs through Dec. 31, 2028.
This is Ferguson’s first appointment to the state’s high court. Sixteen people applied. He said he was evaluating applicants for their intellectual capacity, work ethic and ability to build consensus with other justices.
Melody, a native of Spokane and graduate from the University of Washington law school, worked previously in the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.
Ferguson, then attorney general, created the Wing Luke Civil Rights Division and hired Melody to guide the new department in 2015.
In her tenure, Melody has established the division as a “national powerhouse” for standing up for the rights of Washingtonians, “and, we’ve seen, many Americans as well,” Ferguson said.
In 2017, Melody helped lead Washington’s successful challenge to President Trump’s first travel ban, which barred the citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.
This year, Melody’s team won the first temporary restraining order against the second Trump Administration’s attempt to revoke birthright citizenship, protecting the constitutional rights of everyone born in this country.
“She’s a unique talent,” Ferguson said.
Washington’s nine state Supreme Court justices are elected to six-year terms with vacancies filled by appointment of the governor until the next general election. The only requirement for the office is that a prospective justice be admitted to the practice of law in Washington state.
Justice Sal Mungia, the newest member, was sworn into office in January following his narrow election win in November 2024. 
Each year, justices are asked to review more than a thousand cases, mostly from state appeals courts and some from superior courts.
Melody, during her remarks Monday, noted problems with declining credibility in courts and said that “the rule of law seems more fragile than it has to me at any point during my lifetime.”
“It seemed important to me,” she said, “that people of goodwill, who are willing to work hard and who have deep faith in the courts as cornerstones of democracy, that those people be willing to raise their hands and serve.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-2-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

The five-member search advisory constituency, announced Thursday, is tasked with helping to vet candidates for the historically Black university’s next leader, according to the IHL board. 
The board also announced plans to begin recruiting candidates to be Jackson State’s next president in December. The top job at Jackson State has been vacant since May, after Marcus Thompson resigned without explanation less than two years into his tenure. Thompson was the third president to depart in five years. 
Denise Jones-Gregory, who was the provost and vice president of academic affairs, is serving as the interim president. 
The constituency members “were selected for their professional insight and long-time connections with Jackson State University,” John Sewell, director of communications for the IHL board, said in an email.
The search advisory constituency group members are: 

Nicholas J. Hill, dean of the College of Business 
Candice L. Jackson, secretary of the faculty senate and an associate professor in the Department of English, Foreign Languages and Speech Communications 
Deidre L. Wheaton, associate dean of the College of Education and Human Development
Retired Brigadier General Robert Crear, Jackson State Development Foundation advisory board member
Patrease Edwards, national alumni association president

Some alumni still question if the IHL board will allow the group full agency to properly vet candidate applications and approve of candidate finalists. Jackson State alumni and supporters have questioned the IHL board’s opaque search process, advocating for more stakeholder input into selecting the next president.  
The creation of the constituency group is one way the board is acting on concerns from JSU alumni and supporters who want more input in the search process. Last month, the board voted unanimously to create the group.
IHL board policies allow for the creation of an advisory group of up to 15 members. It’s not clear why they selected only five. John Sewell, a spokesman for the board, did not directly respond to a question from Mississippi Today about the rationale for the group size.
The IHL board has not used an advisory group to assist with Jackson State’s president searches since 2017. That search resulted in IHL hiring William Bynum, who was unpopular among alumni and constituents — but Bynum wasn’t on the list of finalists the constituency group recommended. 
The board ultimately rejected the group’s input and named Bynum president of the university. Bynum resigned in 2020 after he was arrested in a prostitution bust that ended his presidential term. 
In 2022, the IHL board revised its policies to provide for a search advisory constituency. 
The advisory group should have a meaningful stake in the selection of Jackson State’s next president, said Mark Dawson, chairman of Thee 1877 Project, an alumni-led group advocating for transparency in the selection process. The number of alumni selected for the advisory group is disappointing, he said, and the individuals the IHL board selected for the advisory group doesn’t represent a breadth of alumni voices.
“Members should have the full ability to reject and approve candidates. As constituents, we should also know who the potential finalists are for university president,” Dawson told Mississippi Today.  “Our group will continue to advocate for a fair, transparent search and the opportunity for all constituents and stakeholders voices to be heard and involved in the university’s president search.” 
Sen. Sollie Norwood, a Democrat from Jackson, said he would want more representation of students and community in the group, but ultimately, those chosen will have the best interest of the university at heart. 
“My hope is that after all this we will have a leader in place. We’re missing out on a lot of opportunities, and we all need to galvanize and work together to take Jackson State to a place where it should rightfully be,” Norwood said. 
Since August, the IHL board has gathered constituent feedback to shape the role before it starts to seek potential applicants. The job profile will provide an overview of Jackson State as well as information on issues and challenges stakeholders presented during campus listening sessions in October.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/06182234/JSU18.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill is condemning the Trump administration for launching an investigation into an Arizona senator accused of misconduct by the Pentagon.
U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday said U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona) brought “discredit upon the armed forces” for joining other Democrats last week in a video telling military members they have the right to refuse to follow illegal orders. Kelly is a retired Navy captain.
Sherrill, a Democrat and former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot, in a statement called the Trump administration’s targeting of Kelly “another abuse of power by the most incompetent and unfit Secretary of Defense in our nation’s history.”
“Sen. Mark Kelly — a New Jersey native and fellow U.S. Navy veteran — has served our country with distinction, both in combat and space missions. Now, Hegseth wants to prosecute him for stating unequivocally that service members must follow the law and the Constitution — a reminder that Hegseth himself should heed,” she said.
Sherrill was elected governor earlier this month, and takes office on Jan. 20.
The six Democrats who appeared in last week’s video have been battling Trump since it dropped, with Trump accusing them of “seditious behavior at the highest level.” The Pentagon on Monday said potential repercussions for Kelly include recalling him to active duty for court-martial proceedings. 
Kelly said on social media that he would not be intimidated out of “holding this administration accountable.”
“I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution,” he said.
Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Kelly and the other Democrats in the video were encouraging “disorder and chaos within the ranks.”
“Not a single one of them … can point to a single illegal order that this administration has given down because it does not exist,” Leavitt said. “They knew what they were doing in this video and Sen. Mark Kelly and all of them should be held accountable for that.”

The lawsuit, filed last week in state court, asks a judge to pause Magellan of Idaho’s plans to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings. The cuts, providers argue, would effectively end the program, risking worsening mental health conditions and violent episodes in communities. 
“This is critical care — without their medication, these patients pose a serious threat of harm to themselves or others,” attorneys for the clinics wrote in support of their motion for a stay on the planned cut.
Magellan’s cuts, announced late last month, stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. The private company, which runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits, plans to cut peer support services and the mobile treatment program, called Assertive Community Treatment, on Dec. 1.
Spokespeople for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Magellan Health declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying they don’t comment on pending litigation.

The providers argue that the state can’t change payment methods for the Assertive Community Treatment program “without following the required procedures; without publishing its decision and the reason for it; and without otherwise complying with applicable law.”
Idaho Medicaid contractor to cut critical services for people with severe mental illness

Days before the lawsuit was filed, several leaders of the mental health clinics that sued the state told the Idaho Capital Sun they feared these cuts could risk violent episodes in communities. 
Many of the roughly 400 to 500 people on the program will end up homeless if the program ends, Tueller Counseling Service Clinical Director Tom Tueller previously told the Sun.
In a news release Saturday, the Idaho Association of Community Providers said the program ending would shift costs to police, jails, local governments, hospitals and emergency medical services. The group’s analysis said the program costs the state $7 million each year.
“Idaho is eliminating every evidence-based program for its highest-acuity psychiatric populations,” the analysis found. “These cuts will not save money — they will destabilize six distinct populations and shift $150-180 (million) in new costs to Idaho’s hospitals, counties, EMS systems, and child-welfare programs.”
A Change.org petition opposing Magellan’s cuts has over 7,500 signatures.

(Courtesy of Getty Images)After a months-long state budget impasse that resulted in no new recurring funding for mass transit agencies, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Monday that he’s sending an additional $220 million to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) to fund repairs and infrastructure projects meant to improve safety. 
The money will come from the Public Transit Trust Fund, which is broadly used for capital projects, and will be used in part to comply with federal mandates following a series of fires on SEPTA railcars.
“800,000 riders depend on SEPTA every single day, including 55,000 students who rely on SEPTA to get to school,” Shapiro said at a press conference Monday in Chester County. “… Mass transit is critical to our commonwealth’s success, it is critical to our commonwealth’s economy, and it’s critical that we invest in it.”
SEPTA is the largest mass transit authority in Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, its leaders warned that the agency was entering a “death spiral” unless lawmakers could find a new source of funding.

Ultimately, the Shapiro administration directed funding from the state’s Public Transit Trust Fund to SEPTA to keep the transit authority afloat. However, many Democratic state lawmakers and mass transit advocates say a long-term solution — and more money — is still needed.
The $220 million Shapiro announced for SEPTA today, the second major investment in a matter of months, will be used to repair and maintain its existing fleet, purchase new equipment, upgrade infrastructure in SEPTA stations, and replace catenary wires for trolleys and railcars.
SEPTA General Manager Scott Sauer said the projects are necessary to “overcome the current crises” and “prevent problems moving forward.”
“We’re looking at every mile of infrastructure, each railcar, bus and all the other equipment that SEPTA runs to make sure we are putting out safe and reliable service each day,” he added.
SEPTA had already been carrying out a series of safety improvement projects following an emergency order from the Federal Railroad Administration after an investigation into five fires on Silverliner IV railcars used by the transit authority which had passengers on board.
The Governor made the announcement at SEPTA’s Frazer Shop & Yard in Chester County.
A long fight over transit funding
When budget negotiations began in February, mass transit funding was a key point of disagreement at the state Capitol between Democrats, who have a large Philadelphia-area caucus, and Republicans, who are more likely to represent rural parts of the state and object to increases in recurring spending.
Shapiro and Democrats had pushed to increase the share of sales tax the state directs to transit authorities in all 67 counties, which cover urban, rural and suburban areas. But Republicans in the state Senate ultimately blocked those efforts, citing, in part, failures by the largest transit authorities to tackle issues of crime and fare evasion. 
Roughly 1 million Pennsylvanians — about one in 13  people in the state — use mass transit every day across the commonwealth.
“Sadly, the Republicans who lead the Senate have been unwilling to come up with a deal to deliver reliable, recurring funding for mass transit,” Shapiro said at Monday’s press conference. “That left SEPTA in a position earlier this summer where they didn’t have enough funding for their operating costs at their operating service levels.”
What’s at stake over proposed increase in mass transit funding in Pa.? 

While budget negotiations dragged on last summer, SEPTA announced a series of fare raises and service cuts to offset what they called a lack of state funding. However, the Court of Common Pleas blocked the proposed cuts to bus and rail service, saying they disproportionately impacted low-income and minority riders..
The Shapiro administration then directed $394 million in capital projects funding to SEPTAy, effectively ending the fight over new transit funding in the 2025-2026 state budget.
It was a victory for Republicans, who had pushed to fund the state’s transit authorities with money from the Public Transportation Trust Fund, which they said contained more money than necessary for just the capital projects it was intended for.
“We have been consistent in recognizing the value of transit while making it clear investments by taxpayers need to include reasonable accountability measures,” Sen. Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said in a statement Monday. “It was not until our transparency efforts shed light on the massive fund balance that the Governor’s hand was forced to finally make these resources available for their intended use.”
But SEPTA and other transit authorities say the solution was only a stopgap, and are continuing to push for a new source of recurring revenue that will keep them afloat into the future.
“For the second year in a row, Gov. Shapiro has stepped up and offered a lifeline to public transit in the southeast,” said Sauer.
In 2024, Shapiro unilaterally diverted $153 million in federal highway to SEPTA, a move that Republicans in the statehouse objected to.
Shapiro was also joined Monday by Democratic allies, such as Philadelphia Mayor Charelle Parker, Senate Appropriations Chair Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia) and House Transportation Chair Ed Neilson (D-Philadelphia).",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SEPTA-Bus-2025-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City) pleaded not guilty Monday to federal extortion charges alongside her two co-defendants, during a brief appearance in U.S. District Court in Baltimore.
A federal grand jury indicted Attar in October, on charges that she attempted to blackmail a political consultant who she feared would spread negative information about her to thwart her 2022 reelection campaign.
Prosecutors allege that Attar’s brother, Joseph Attar, took part in the plot, as did a campaign volunteer, Kalman Finkelstein, a Baltimore City police officer who has been suspended without pay.
Attar, brother and campaign volunteer charged with reelection extortion plot

All three, who were released from federal custody, appeared together in the courtroom Monday morning before Magistrate Judge Douglas R. Miller, each represented by their own attorneys. During the brief proceedings, each defendant rose and affirmed that they understood the charges, before formally entering their pleas.
Judge Miller set a Dec. 15 deadline for pretrial motions, though either side could request an extension.
Jeff Ifrah, an attorney for Dalya Attar, issued a statement after Monday’s hearing that said he plans to file a motion to dismiss the case. Attorneys representing the other two defendants declined to comment following Monday’s proceedings.
Attar, 35, was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2018, as a Democrat representing Baltimore’s District 41, and reelected in 2022. In January, she was appointed to fill the District 41 Senate seat, which became vacant when former Sen. Jill Carter stepped down.
Besides serving in the General Assembly, Attar is a lawyer and a former Baltimore City assistant state’s attorney.
Prosecutors allege that as Attar prepared for her 2022 reelection bid for the House of Delegates, Attar grew concerned that a political consultant, who was not identified in court documents, would attempt to derail her campaign, according to her indictment.
The three defendants, alongside unnamed co-conspirators, colluded to install cameras inside smoke detectors in a room where the consultant was staying, and videotape the consultant having an extramarital affair.

“I just want her to be a non-issue in my mind and in reality that won’t happen as long as she is relevant or doesn’t have anything to worry about,” the then-delegate wrote in a January 2020 message.
Joseph Attar ultimately used the footage to threaten both the consultant and the married man with whom she was having the affair.
Each of the three defendants face charges including conspiracy, extortion and interception and disclosure of a wire, oral or electronic communication.

“You decided to commit fraud and murder,” Judge Christina Reiss said in imposing the prison term for Serhat Gumrukcu in the 2018 killing of Gregory Davis of Vermont.

BURLINGTON — Calling his crimes “brutal” and “brazen,” a judge ordered a former California man to spend the rest of his life behind bars for leading a cross-country murder-for-hire plot that led to the death of a Vermont man.
The sentence handed down Monday by Judge Christina Reiss in federal court in Burlington came after 43-year-old Serhat Gumrukcu maintained his innocence and claimed he played no role in the events leading to the 2018 fatal shooting of 49-year-old Gregory Davis of Danville. 
“I didn’t plan it, I didn’t ask for it, “I didn’t know about it,” he said during the hearing.

This was the first time Gumrukcu spoke publicly since a jury convicted him in April following a five-week trial. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all charges, including murder for hire and conspiring to commit wire fraud. The verdict came after three other co-defendants reached plea deals and testified against him. 
In pronouncing the sentence Monday, the judge pointed out that Gumrukcu had the sole motive for the killing — silencing Davis, so he wouldn’t expose his deceitful business schemes — and that he should bear the consequences for his actions. 
“You decided to commit fraud and murder,” she said.
Gumrucku is a Turkish national who had been living in Los Angeles, California, for about a decade before Gregory Davis’ killing. In Turkey, Gumrukcu had worked as a magician before moving to the United States where prosecutors said he falsely posed as a medical doctor.   
Gumrukcu’s husband, William Anderson Wittekind, attended the hearing, sitting in the courtroom gallery behind him. After the hearing as Gumrukcu was placed in handcuffs and being led away, he turned to Wittekind and the two appeared to share a glance.
The three other participants in the plot were sentenced over two days in September to prison terms ranging between roughly nine and 16 years.
Gumrukcu was also initially set to be sentenced at that time, but sentencing was delayed after his attorney requested more time to prepare for the proceeding.
The murder-for-hire charge alone against Gumrukcu carried a mandatory sentence of life in prison, leaving little suspense about what sentence Gumrukcu would receive.
“I didn’t choose the sentence for you, Congress did,” the judge told Gumrukcu in formally imposing it.
In addressing the court, Gumrukcu said he made mistakes but still followed his principles and commitment to non-violence, maintaining that he wasn’t involved in the killing of Davis, despite the jury’s verdict.
Gumrukcu said he has sympathy for the family and what they have been through, but was saddened by the fact they believe he was involved in the plot. 
In her statement to the court, Melissa Davis, Gregory Davis’ wife, thanked all the people who worked to ensure justice, saying that she and her family are living proof that the legal system works.
Gregory Davis was the father of six when he was killed, and his wife was pregnant with the couple’s seventh child. 
Melissa Davis remembered her husband as “funny” and “brilliant” and described how his absence has been felt in every birthday, graduation, and holiday he missed. 
Still, she forgave Gumrukcu even if he had shown no remorse. She had previously addressed the four defendants in September and offered forgiveness to all of them, but Gumrukcu.
“It is not my job to condemn you — that belongs to God,” Davis told Gumrukcu on Monday. “My job is to live free,” she said, adding that forgiveness would allow her to move forward without anger or bitterness.
Gumrukcu and Gregory Davis had spent years prior to the murder working on a several million dollar business deal involving oil trading. Prosecutors had contended during the trial that Gumrukcu masterminded a plot to kill Davis because he was afraid the Vermont man was going to expose his fraudulent business tactics. Prosecutors added that Gumrukcu had sent fake emails and provided phony financial records. 
Jerry Banks, a former detention officer in Colorado, had been recruited by another plot member to serve as the hitman. Banks shot and killed Davis on a snowy night in January 2018 after kidnapping Davis from his home. Banks, posing as a deputy U.S. Marshal complete with a uniform and badge, showed up at Davis’ residence and told him was under arrest for racketeering.
Banks, according to prosecutors, then drove Davis away from the home in handcuffs before stopping a few miles away in a pull off in Barnet where he ordered Davis out of the vehicle. Banks then repeatedly shot Davis, killing him.
Investigators spent the next several years poring over business and banking documents and electronic records to piece together the links among the four men prosecutors would eventually charge for their roles in the deadly plot.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Stendig, one of the prosecutors, told the judge that while Gumrukcu quoted the nonviolence philosophy spoken by Gandhi, it would be Davis’ murder that would define Gumrukcu’s life.
Susan Marcus, Gumrukcu’s attorney, contested the prosecution’s argument that Gumrukcu had obstructed justice. 
But the judge disagreed with her, saying that Gumrukcu’s trial testimony – denying any participation in the murder-for-hire plot – amounted to perjury and obstruction of justice.
In addition to sentencing Gumrukcu, the judge ordered that all four defendants should pay a total of $1.36 million in restitution to Davis’ family.  
The payments made by each of the defendants toward that restitution would be based, in large part, on a percentage of their incomes. The restitution figure, according to prosecutors, was based on an estimate of the amount of money Davis would have earned had he continued to work up until his retirement age.
Davis’ estate has also filed a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Gumrukcu in federal court in Vermont, which remains pending. 
Melissa Davis, leaving the courtroom, spoke about Gumrukcu’s statement in court.
“He was trying to become the victim, and I reversed his lies with the truth,” she said. “Justice has been served.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)State lawmakers are recommending the General Assembly continue to ease regulations for housing developers and strongly consider funding to incentivize housing and infrastructure construction as Kentucky grapples with a significant housing shortage. 
A couple of lawmakers on the Kentucky Housing Task Force during a Monday meeting emphasized the urgency of the shortage as the panel released recommendations ahead of the legislative session beginning in January.
A national research firm hired by the Kentucky Housing Corp. estimated last year the state needs more than 200,000 housing units, including rentals and homes for sale. The gap could grow to over 287,000 units by 2029 without efforts to build or repair housing, the study said, with low-income renters being particularly squeezed by the growing shortage. 
Rep. Mike Clines, R-Alexandria, told his colleagues the legislature must act. “I do think it’s time for us to really write some legislation that’s going to make some changes for our housing shortage,” Clines said.
The nine-page memo of recommendations, created after four prior meetings of the task force that began this summer, recounted gathering input from a number of groups including the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, the libertarian think tank Mercatus Center, the Homebuilders Association of Kentucky, the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity and the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky. 
Most of the recommendations to lawmakers for the 2026 legislative session, when a two-year state budget will be crafted, focused on regulatory changes that seek to lower the cost of housing construction by either encouraging or mandating state and local governments “eliminate barriers” to building new homes. 
Those regulatory recommendations include: 

A two-year moratorium on any changes to state building and electrical codes “that would result in any increase to construction costs of residential units.” 
Allowing regulated third parties to issue permits for housing construction in lieu of the state. 
Recommending that local laws requiring a certain number of parking spots for housing developments “be reduced or eliminated entirely.” 
Various changes to the state building code that would “reduce costs to homebuilders.” One recommended change includes requiring only one staircase in multi-family and apartment buildings, the memo arguing that the cost is “exorbitant” to require additional staircases in larger housing developments “while any safety benefit is likely negligible.” 
Allowing religious institutions to build housing on their own land with less regulation, pointing to a bill filed, but not passed, in this year’s legislative session that aimed to do that.

The lawmakers on the task force write in their memo that the regulatory changes would build on bills signed into law during this year’s legislative session such as a law that prevents local governments from implementing certain restrictions on manufactured housing.
Sen. Robby Mills, R-Henderson, a co-chair of the task force, in a Lantern interview after the meeting said a large debate before the legislature is how far the state government will go in telling local communities how to regulate housing construction. Mills said he generally supports local government control but that “we’ve got to get active in building residential units.”
“We’ve got to allow more building to take place in Kentucky. And if it doesn’t happen then we need to step in, or we’re going to be, once again, falling behind,” Mills said. “I do believe the locals need to have an opportunity to act and react.” 
New take on factory-built could ease housing crunch, says Kentucky nonprofit

The task force recommends allowing local governments to establish “districts” within their boundaries where housing developers and local governments would be incentivized to build. 
The task force is also calling for lawmakers to strongly consider throwing state funding at the issue, especially to establish a revolving loan fund for housing infrastructure similar to a fund in Indiana and to create a state low-income housing tax credit to match an existing federal tax credit. 
Adrienne Bush, the executive director of the advocacy group Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, said she’s overall “pretty pleased” with the memo, including a recommendation that would increase the real estate transaction fees that go toward the state’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund that subsidizes housing construction. 
“We have this proven tool. It’s been working well for Kentucky,” Bush said, referring to the fund. “It just really hasn’t kept pace with what is needed to build and repair and renovate.” 
Bush said that “housing is fundamental” despite potential budget constraints. Republican legislative leadership is projecting a more challenging state budget due to federal funding uncertainty, and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has said his administration is making adjustments after state revenue came in below projections for the last fiscal year.
“It is becoming clearer, clearer and clearer every day that without state financial intervention, Kentucky is going to continue to fall further and further behind in terms of our housing stock,” Bush said.
As the state budget is crafted, Mills said, a lot of things will “fall on the cutting floor because of the cost of Medicaid and other large ticket items.” He said he still planned to encourage his fellow lawmakers to put money into incentivizing affordable housing construction.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_9913-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota soybean industry leaders said Monday that a new trade pledge with China is lifting prices but hasn’t erased anxiety about how much farmers depend on a single foreign buyer.
“China’s the number one buyer of soybeans out of the United States,” said Tom Kersting, CEO of South Dakota Soybean Processors. “At times, they buy 60% of all the exported soybeans out of the U.S.”
Harvest of stress: Soybean farmers await help as tariff dispute closes China market

Kersting was one of the participants in a panel discussion about soybeans hosted by the Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary Club. South Dakota produced $2.3 billion worth of soybeans last year, the ninth highest value in the nation.
Kersting said China has “quietly” stepped back into the U.S. soybean market since Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the trade pledge in late October, after China had been boycotting purchases of U.S. soybeans in retaliation for tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Soybean prices at grain elevators were “right around $9” per bushel before the news of the trade pledge, Kersting said, and are now “over $10.”
But farmers are not benefiting equally from the price bump. Some sold at lower prices before the trade pledge announcement.
“The prices really didn’t appreciate till after harvest was pretty much complete,” Kersting said. “The ones that had some beans stored, they’ll see those gains.”
By his rough estimate, a new $500 million Mitchell soybean processing plant that opened in September has added 25 cents per bushel in value to local cash bids. 
Lake Preston farmer Paul Casper said the price increase has pushed him “closer to break-even on beans,” while Trump’s tariffs have raised the price of farm inputs such as fertilizers.
Casper said Brazil has emerged as a rival to U.S. soybean farmers after years of infrastructure investment backed by China, which makes the future feel less certain. Yet Casper said he still has faith in Trump. 
“I’m still thinking this dealmaker dude has got something up his sleeve,” Casper said.

Kersting said the threat of tariffs nudged other buyers to the table, including Vietnam and Thailand, “who we sell a lot of soybean meal to.”
Both men warned that long-term overreliance on China leaves U.S. agriculture vulnerable.
“At the end of the day, you should not be making deals with people you don’t trust, and nobody trusts them,” Kersting said. 
Doug Sombke, president of the South Dakota Farmers Union, did not appear on the panel, but said weeks ago after the trade pledge announcement that Trump is attempting to put out a fire he himself started, “and the building is already charred.”
“We went backward from where we started, and we didn’t need to do that,” Sombke said. “This isn’t a win. We’ve been played.”
Sombke said the numbers he has heard regarding the trade agreement fall short of what producers were counting on. He said smaller and beginning farmers are being squeezed the hardest.
“Well-established farmers are just going to eat through some of their equity,” he said. “But the younger farmer, the smaller guy, doesn’t have that.”
Sarah Sellars, an assistant professor and Extension specialist at South Dakota State University, told South Dakota Searchlight that the trade deal is “positive in a market that’s been facing a lot of negative news lately,” but said farmers “are still facing really tight crop margins.”
“If we’re not factoring in the money given by government programs or crop insurance, the cost of production is higher than what we’re actually able to sell the crop for,” she said.
On Monday, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the Trump administration plans to announce a financial aid package for U.S. farmers and provide more details on the China trade deal within two weeks. The aid package is designed to compensate farmers with government payments for tariff-related losses.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in The Citizen on Nov. 20, 2025.
“No hunting” signs posted around Charlotte’s 50-acre Burn’s Meadow have stirred contention between an elected official and volunteer, resulting in the co-chair of the trails committee leaving his post after saying he was “harassed” by a selectboard member earlier this month.
Jack Pilla, co-chair of the trails committee, submitted a written resignation to the selectboard earlier this month and filed a formal complaint this week, saying selectboard member Lewis Mudge “verbally attacked” him after Pilla placed “No Hunting” signs along the perimeter of Burn’s Meadow.
Mudge, in a phone call, denied Pilla’s characterization of the conversation as “harassment,” and said his concern was rooted in the lack of proper procedure taken and the possibility that the new signs would open the town to a legal battle with an upset hunter.

Pilla said he received a phone call in September from someone wondering about hunting on other recreation paths located in the town. He said there’s always been discussion about whether hunting is allowed on town-owned lands that are near the extensive trail network. He often sees people out squirrel hunting, noting that seeing someone sitting up in a tree stand with a .22 while walking the recreation path can be off-putting for some trail users.
“That’s been a question I’ve had for many years and in the Charlotte Park and Wildlife Refuge, there is no hunting there,” he said. “I was on the [Charlotte Park and Wildlife Refuge] committee years ago, and I actually posted 290 acres of that entire park and not once did I have any negativity from the selectboard. I had some feedback from some of the locals who like to hunt there, but it is what it is.”
Pilla said former town administrator Nate Bareham — who resigned in October — gave him permission to move forward with the state’s procedure of posting the land.
The registration for Burn’s Meadow, located just off Greenbush Road, was submitted, with the town administrator’s signature, to the town clerk’s office on Oct. 13, citing the property’s proximity to the public trail system. “There are regular posted signs that the state wants you to use and that’s exactly what we used,” Pilla said. “And you have to date them, and then there’s a whole procedure of [posting] every 400 feet and it has to be on the perimeter. So, I did that.”
He said roughly 20 signs had been posted, although most, as of Monday, had been taken down, with a few still spotted along the perimeter. While the signs remained unbothered for a few weeks that followed, in November, he was contacted by Mudge. “Within a two-hour period, before I could even talk to him on the phone, he had called and texted and voice mailed me eight times,” Pilla said. “I call that harassment.”
He said after he finally called Mudge back, the conversation — which he said wasn’t really a two-way dialogue — lasted roughly three and a half minutes before he finally had to hang up. “He was just livid and was all over me,” Pilla said. “I couldn’t deal with any more of his yelling at me.”
For Mudge, the issue isn’t just whether there should or should not be hunting on town land. It was ultimately a concern over ensuring proper procedures and public input are being taken and the real possibility of opening the town to extensive legal liability. He learned about the signs from a hunter in town, who said he was prepared to consult a lawyer due to the issue.
And although Pilla went to the town administrator, Mudge says the green light should never have been given in the first place, seeing as a town administrator works under the direction and supervision of the selectboard.
“The signs say that we’re going to prosecute anyone who’s violating these laws,” Mudge said. “With all due respect to Jack, and I’m not saying that facetiously, he can’t post signs saying that the town is going to prosecute people without running that by the selectboard. The town administrator at the time, frankly, made a mistake that should have been raised with the selectboard and it wasn’t.”
Charlotte is not the only Chittenden County town in which committees are discussing how to balance the wide array of users on town-owned forests and land. The approach is, however, different.
The Citizen reported last week that the neighboring town of Hinesburg’s forest committee opted this year to close a large swath of the recreation trails in the Town Forest and the LaPlatte Headwaters Town Forest to all recreation except hunting from Oct. 25 to Dec. 14 in order to encourage the sport as a management tool to prevent over-browsing by deer.
Charlotte selectboard chair and liaison to the trails committee, Lee Krohn, did not comment on the situation or how the selectboard could chart a path forward. But in an email to Pilla following his resignation, both Krohn and Mudge expressed their dismay that Pilla had resigned from the town committee.
“Not happy you are resigning, Jack. You’ve done an admirable job on the trails committee,” Mudge wrote in an email to Pilla. “Sorry things got heated on the call, Jack. It is just that procedures were not followed correctly. I hope you will reconsider your resignation.”
Pilla, in his formal complaint, cited the town’s harassment policy as a violation and, in a separate email, requested that Mudge be removed from his selectboard seat. While his resignation remains as is for now, he did admit that he’s not sure how long he will be able to stay away from the trail work that he’s spent over two years dedicating his time to.
It remains unclear what the status of the posted signs are or how the selectboard will take the issue up. The selectboard and former town administrator have been drafting a new handbook for committees and commissions in town that they’re hoping will more clearly establish general rules of procedure for volunteers, public officers and boards.
But in this case, it may be too little, too late.
“I just don’t need this shit, selectboard members all over me when I am following procedure doing work on the trails,” Pilla wrote. “I’m a volunteer spending way too much time and energy to make a better place for people in this town and I don’t need to be yelled at by Lewis for following procedure.”

(Photo provided)An abrupt shift in the way the federal government allocates funds to help the homeless has shocked groups that provide housing aid throughout Kentucky, a change advocates say could put many low-income, mostly disabled Kentuckians, back on the streets.
Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky
“We are looking at a severe cut to our existing programming,” said Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, which helps provide homes for about 60 households. “There are folks who without this program would be homeless. They most likely will be homeless again without rent support and case management.”
Overall, the changes announced Nov. 13 by the U.S. Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) could put more than 2,000 Kentucky households at risk of becoming homeless again, according to an analysis by the Corporation for Supportive Housing, which is working with providers.
In Louisville, the changes could cause more than half the 1,900 people in what’s called “permanent supportive housing” to lose housing, according to the Louisville Coalition for the Homeless.
“This puts everything at risk,” said Katharine Dobbins, CEO of Wellspring, a Louisville nonprofit that specializes in finding homes for and supporting people with severe mental illness. “Many people we serve come from chronic homelessness. There’s a reason people are chronically homeless. They usually are pretty disabled.”
At stake is much of about $48 million that flows to Kentucky each year in HUD money, with the largest portion, $23 million, going to Louisville. Most of it is used  for permanent, supportive housing to help people find and stay in homes with services including counseling, mental health and addiction treatment, financial education and other help.
For more than a decade, HUD has prioritized such spending as the best way to combat homelessness, with about 90% going to permanent housing. But the new federal rules announced Nov. 13 cut to about 30% what states can spend on permanent housing.
‘Biden-era slush fund’
This month, the federal government announced a major shift in how it allocates funds, stressing that the majority of money now must go to short-term, “transitional” housing aimed at getting people into jobs and in charge of their own housing.
Generally, transitional housing is covered for about 24 months.
In a news release, HUD announced the new funding priorities as “monumental reforms” aimed at ending the “Biden-era slush fund.”
“We are stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values and incentivized never-ending government dependency,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in the news release. The new plan, Turner said, will carry out President Donald Trump’s mandate to “make our cities and towns beautiful and safe.”

It also announced a new method to score applications for HUD money that considers public safety, self-sufficiency, enhanced treatment options and “cracks down on DEI, gender-ideology extremism, and the misuse and abuse of taxpayer dollars on illegal aliens.”
‘Cruelty and criminalization’
Advocates, including the  Washington D.C.-based National Low Income Housing Coalition, say the changes will simply worsen the nation’s struggle with homelessness.
The HUD changes “signal a fundamental shift in federal homeless policy away from effective, humane approaches and toward wasteful cruelty and criminalization,” it said in a news release.
In Kentucky, around 3,700 individuals with disabling conditions live in permanent, supportive housing, which advocates say has proven to be the best solution for preventing homelessness.
Catherine McGeeney. communications director, Louisville Coalition for the Homeless
“We know that permanent housing is the solution to homelessness,” said Catherine McGeeney, communications director for the Louisville Coalition for the Homeless, which coordinates HUD funding for the area. “It effectively ends homelessness.”
And the changes will affect a wide range of programs throughout Kentucky including housing help offered by domestic violence, veterans and mental health groups as well as agencies that directly serve the homeless, Bush said.
At Volunteers of America (VOA) in Louisville, staff are looking at how to best try to preserve funds for programs such as Unity House, that help families in its shelter with services meant to help them become independent and move to housing, said Tamara Reif, director of housing services. The nonprofit agency also provides case management for residents in permanent housing supported by Louisville city government.
“Case management is what keeps folks housed,” Reif said. “The more services you provide to people, the more they are going to stay housed and not return to homelessness.”
The new federal rules allow case management but now require at least 40 hours a week for services including counseling, job training and other aid. Work hours may be included in the 40-hour requirement.
VOA typically provides about six hours  to 10 hours a week of case management.
More than 50% of clients VOA now serves already have jobs and most of the rest are seeking employment, Reif said.
‘Bad for all of us’
In Kentucky, advocates agree self-sufficiency is an important objective, stressed in services offered to the homeless. But many clients with severe mental illness, addiction and other disabilities simply can’t go through a short-term “transition” program and be expected to survive independently, they said.
“It will be bad for all of us, even if you’re not currently experiencing homelessness,” Bush said. “If you’re frustrated with the number of people on the streets or camping, it’s just going to cause that number of people to grow.”
McGeeney said she understands the frequent complaints by some about the growing number of homeless encampments and people on the streets.
That’s because the number of people losing housing is growing faster than local housing services can accommodate, she said.
In 2025, about 5,800 people in Kentucky were considered homeless through an annual “point in time” count, a number that has increased every year since 2022, Bush said.
Last year, programs in Louisville placed 1,600 people into housing even as another 3,300 people became homeless, McGeeney said.
“We know the programs we are running are very effective,” McGeeney said. “Ninety percent of the people we put into permanent housing stay housed. We just don’t receive enough funding for those programs.”
Now agencies are likely to receive less money unless they can reorganize or repurpose services to align with the new HUD requirements.
But the changes — combined with unusually short deadlines — have left agencies scrambling to decide how to provide as much help as possible to the homeless.
In past years, HUD typically announced funding criteria for the following year by late summer, McGeeney said. And typically, the federal government would simply renew most existing programs that met standards.
This year, the notice for applicants was issued Nov. 13 with a deadline for applications of Jan. 14 to apply for HUD funds with dramatically different rules. And new awards of funding won’t be announced until early May, though some federal grants will expire before May 1.
‘Scramble’ to apply
“It’s so quick to shift everything over,” said Ra’Shann Martin, executive director of the St. John Center in Louisville.
St. John provides a day center for homeless people as well as providing housing for 200 formerly homeless people, Martin said.
“Housing is the long-term solution we want for everybody,” she said. “Supportive housing is the intervention that has been the most effective at helping people succeed.”
But getting next year’s application together while trying to preserve resources for the 200 people it helps house has been a “scramble,” she said.
Katharine Dobbins, CEO of Wellspring
“It’s very possible to adapt but just adapting in such a short timeline with so many vulnerable people in our care contributes to the scramble.”
The expiration of some grants with no guarantee of renewal is another concern, said Dobbins, with Wellspring.
Her agency currently provides housing for 24 women with mental health and addiction issues in a program called Journey. Most have experienced significant trauma including sexual abuse and trafficking.
The HUD grant that provides money to pay rent and provide support services to those women expires Jan. 31. If it’s renewed, funds wouldn’t resume until after May 1, she said,
“I’m extremely concerned about this population of women,” Dobbins said. “When the grant ends, their rent ends because there’s no money coming through to pay their rent. Most need support services and we can’t pay staff to provide support. Talk about a cliff.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/St.-john-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 17:58:27.049744

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar and other Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor leaders denounced President Donald Trump and Republicans’ recent attacks on Minnesota’s Somali-American community at the State Capitol on Monday.
“We do not blame the lawlessness of an individual on a whole community,” said Omar, referring to a slew of Minnesota human services fraud cases, many of which involved Somali-Americans charged with bilking hundreds of thousands of dollars from government programs meant to feed hungry children, assist young people with autism and help people find housing.
Trump posted on Truth Social Friday that he’s ending Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota specifically, alleging without evidence that “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State.”
(The legality of removing TPS from residents of a specific state, like Minnesota, is dubious, as noted by Omar.)
Temporary Protected Status for Somalia is currently already scheduled to end in March. Addressing the 400 or so Somalis in Minnesota protected under TPS, Omar said, “We will make sure we do everything that we can to help make sure that your status is adjusted” before then.
Revoking the status would affect 0.5% of Somali Minnesotans. There are roughly 80,000 Somali Minnesotans; an estimated 41,748 residents were born in Somalia as of 2024. Most Somali Minnesotans were either born here or are naturalized citizens. Many came to Minnesota as refugees from an ongoing civil war starting in the 1990s, which the United States has been heavily involved in.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in Minnesota on Sunday that her office will evaluate whether to revoke protections for Somali nationals, which would require giving 60 days’ notice, the New York Times reported.
Trump’s post came two days after a City Journal article alleging that the ill-gotten gains from human services fraud are being funneled into the Al-Shabaab terror network in Somalia.
“We broke the Somali fraud story and called on President Trump to revoke the Temporary Protected Status for all Somalis. Now, the President has delivered,” wrote Rufo in an X post. A Fox9 article in 2018 also made the assertion that fraud cash was going to Al-Shabaab.
Federal prosecutors have said that dollars meant to feed children instead went to buying luxury vehicles, real estate in Minnesota, Ohio, Kentucky, Kenya and Turkey, and to fund international travel.
The U.S. Attorney, which is responsible for federal terrorism charges, has not charged any defendants with financing terrorism.
In another Monday press conference, Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-MN, a Muslim civil rights group, said the broader social media attacks following the article were part of a larger coordinated attempt to spread fear of Muslims by what he called “Israel-first politicians.”
“Obviously it’s normal for people to share things within days, but within minutes means that somehow there is an organized campaign to push this information out and to create it to be viral,” Hussein said.
Noem also announced in an official news release on Monday it will remove Temporary Protected Status from Myanmar effective January 26, citing improvements to the situation in the country.
John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters, “The (U.S.) factual analysis is fantastical. Contrary to its content, there have been no improvements in governance or stability.”

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)U.S. Sen. Susan Collins has signed a referendum effort seeking to bar transgender girls from participating on girls’ sports teams and from using girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms. 
The Republican’s signature was shared on social media Sunday by someone involved with the campaign and reshared by the Maine Republican Party. 
A spokesperson for the senator confirmed on Monday that she had signed the petition.
“Senator Collins supports Title IX, which provides opportunities for girls and women to compete in sports that they did not have prior to the passage of this landmark law,” wrote Blake Kernan in an emailed statement. “That federal law makes distinctions on the basis of sex, not on the basis of gender identity, thus promoting fair competition.” 
Kernan continued, “Reflecting this view of the federal law, she signed the petition, but will not be involved in the state referendum campaign because, as a federal official, she does not advocate on state ballot issues.”
Collins took a similar position earlier this year, when several agencies in the Trump administration launched probes into Maine’s inclusive transgender student policies and threatened the state with the loss of federal funding. 
At the time, Collins wrote on social media that while she would “continue to advocate strongly for federal funding for Maine, I disagree with the state’s position and instead support the original intent behind Title IX.” 
“People who are transgender deserve to be treated with respect and dignity,” she wrote. “But that does not change the fact that Title IX mandated equal access to athletic resources and facilities on the basis of sex — not on the basis of gender identity.”
Title IX, the federal anti discrimination law, has been consistently interpreted by the Trump administration to enforce action against trans people, although the law itself does not mention them, and has been interpreted by courts to protect gender identity. 
Petition effort
The petition will need about 68,000 signatures by early February to make it onto the 2026 ballot. The number of signatures required represents 10% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in 2022. 
If it passes, the proposal would require schools to separate athletic teams, locker rooms, and bathrooms strictly by “biological sex,” forcing trans students to use facilities corresponding to their sex assigned at birth. It would also mandate the establishment of coed teams. 
The petition is the latest effort by a conservative group to roll back Maine’s inclusive policies, which for two decades have guaranteed transgender students the right to participate on teams and use facilities aligned with their gender identity under the Maine Human Rights Act.
The proposal resembles recent rules adopted by several school boards that defy state anti-discrimination laws. Last week, the Maine Human Rights Commission sued five districts that recently passed anti-trans policies. 
Kit Thompson Crossman, executive director of the quasi-independent state agency, told Maine Morning Star that a lawsuit is the fastest, most transparent way to ensure that schools do not impose rules that discriminate against students based on gender identity. 
A coalition of LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations have denounced the effort, expressing concern that the campaign and the politicization of the issue will negatively impact trans kids in Maine.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cumberland-trans-rally-10-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 17:58:27.049744

Jennifer Cogley, director of programs for the foundation, said Monday the coalition has reached its $50,000 fundraising goal.

“Across Poweshiek County, food pantries and meal programs are already feeling increased demand, and they are working tirelessly to support families who are struggling,” Cogley said in the release. “The Grinnell Food Coalition is committed to uplifting these organizations. We believe it’s essential to work alongside the groups who have their boots on the ground every day, ensuring our neighbors have access to the food they need.”
While benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are being issued once again after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the release stated “many households and local food providers continue to face significant strain as demand for food assistance rises.”
With the funding, the food coalition will distribute “up to” 3,000 $10 vouchers for groceries to those in need across Poweshiek County, according to the release, and bolster area food pantries and other food programs that have seen increased demand. Organizations are also encouraged to apply for emergency food grants through the coalition, as “typical funding limits” will not be applied.
Barb Baker, director of advertising and community relations at Grinnell Mutual, said in the release the donations will hopefully “serve as a springboard for support” for residents and organizations working to help them.
“Grinnell College is glad to be part of a community that pulls together in times of need. We’ve seen this community accomplish amazing things when working together, and we’re proud to collaborate with our partners at Grinnell Mutual to support this emergency response,”  said Monica Chavez-Silva, Grinnell College vice president for community engagement and strategic planning, in the release.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)State employees filed a formal complaint on Monday accusing the Mills administration of not bargaining in good faith in ongoing negotiations for labor contracts that expired at the end of June. 
The state employees’ union, which represents about 10,000 workers across four bargaining units, filed the complaint with the Maine Labor Relations Board Monday, according to a news release.
In the complaint, the Maine Service Employees Association, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union (MSEA-SEIU Local 1989) specifically alleges Gov. Janet Mills’ administration violated state labor laws related to prematurely declaring impasse, regressive bargaining, cancelling bargaining sessions following the premature declaration of impasse, and otherwise engaging in behavior designed to frustrate the collective bargaining process.
After almost a year of attempted negotiations, the Mills administration declared an impasse last month. The union alleges this was done without discussing a third of the proposals put forward by state workers. Now, the union is asking the labor board to order that the declaration of impasse be withdrawn. 
A spokesperson for the Mills administration told Maine Morning Star that the state was surprised by the filing because both parties were supposed to meet Tuesday to discuss the union’s complaint. The state said it disputes each allegation and anticipates filing its response to the complaint by Dec. 15.
“The Administration will continue to negotiate with MSEA and defend itself against these unfortunate claims before the labor relations board,” the spokesperson said
Mark Brunton, president of MSEA-SEIU Local 1989, said the union has for years pleaded with the administration to address widespread recruitment and retention issues among state employees due to uncompetitive wages. 
Brunton said the administration should be held to account “for its intransigence not only at the bargaining table but also for the understaffing problem and the vacancies resulting from the persistent state employee pay gap,” according to the statement. 
Vacant positions not only affect the economy, but can also create “impossible” workloads and, in some cases, dangerous working conditions, he added.
State employees experience a 14% pay gap compared to their private sector counterparts, according to the State of Maine Market Pay Report the Mills administration conducted in September 2024. That is a slight improvement from the 2020 report that showed state employees had a 15% pay gap. 
According to the Mills administration spokesperson, base wages for state employees have increased by 24%, on average, since 2019 when Mills took office. State workers have also received merit increases, longevity pay for staying in their positions longer than five years and other benefits financial or otherwise.
The complaint filed Monday isn’t the first time state employees have gone to those measures. Brunton said they have filed seven such complaints against the administration in the last five years.
“This administration has gone to great lengths, including violating the basic foundations of labor law,” Brunton said.

Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, faces a complaint related to how he spent campaign contributions at, among other places, a barber shop, a cigar shop and a high-end Denver hotel. There is also a donation to the Israeli rugby team Maccabi Tel-Aviv Football Club.
The complaint was filed in August by Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican. Weinberg had an opportunity to respond to the complaint and address the allegations. The submitted documents are not publicly available.
“Given their responses to the Complaint, Respondents did not substantially comply with Colorado campaign finance law,” the investigation notice, dated Nov. 19, says.

The enforcement team in the Elections Division has 30 days to either dismiss the complaint or file it with a hearing officer.
Weinberg told Newsline he thinks the donation to the rugby team triggered the complaint. He said he sponsored the team by purchasing the players’ jerseys when they competed in a 2024 tournament in Glendale. The jerseys featured the phrase “Weinberg for Loveland” and served as advertisement for his campaign. Weinberg is Jewish and has family ties in Israel. He said the opportunity to meet the rugby players at the tournament was a “humbling experience.”
“Everybody has the right to look into this stuff. But I’m not going to lawyer up. I’m fully transparent — I know that everything I’ve done campaign-wise is not in violation,” he said.
Weinberg has served in the House of Representatives since 2022, when he was appointed to replace Hugh McKean after his death. Last week, he announced his reelection campaign for next year.

Michelle Lujan Grisham's remarks on crime during her State of the State speech on Jan. 21, 2025. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Sam Bregman, the Bernalillo County district attorney seeking the Democratic nomination for New Mexico governor, on Friday announced proposals to “fix” the state Legislature by seeking term limits for lawmakers, extending the length of legislative sessions, paying lawmakers and changing the system by which the state doles out funding for big-budget infrastructure projects.
In a statement, Bregman said the changes will ensure the state government “works for the people, not the politicians.”
His campaign’s plan calls for working with state lawmakers to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would create term limits for state representatives and senators; making legislative sessions an annual 90-day affair; creating salaries for state legislators in line with New Mexico’s median salary; and requiring all new capital outlay projects to be included in the state budget and subject to public debate.
Bregman in a statement said the Legislature is “dominated by long-serving incumbents” and hopes that term limits will attract new candidates for office.
Extending the length of legislative sessions, which currently alternate between 30 and 60 days, would give policymakers adequate time to effectively govern, he said. In the 2025 regular legislative session, leaders from the nonprofit Common Cause New Mexico pushed to “modernize” the Legislature, noting that its sessions are among the shortest in the U.S. The short sessions routinely lead to debates that are “curtailed and cut short,” the group said at the time.
Bregman’s campaign said that providing salaries for New Mexico’s lawmakers, who are the only ones in the nation not to earn compensation for that work, would lower barriers to holding elected office.
And introducing more public debate to the capital outlay request process would cut down on the potential for “political favors” to be the deciding factor in which costly public infrastructure projects advance.
“For far too long, New Mexico has been last in all the good things and first in all the bad things,” Bregman said in a statement. “With the right leadership, New Mexico can finally move from the bottom of the rankings to the top, where we belong.”
If elected, any road toward implementing Bregman’s envisioned changes would have to go through the state’s 100-plus lawmakers. It’s unclear whether there’s much appetite among those office-holders for provisions such as term limits.
“If you expect me to be a full-time legislator and you’re going to pay me enough to do that … that’s a lot of money,” Senate Minority Floor Leader William Sharer (R-Farmington) told Source NM. Any salary from the state would likely be less than he earns as a business owner and traveling to Santa Fe for three months each year could make it impractical to continue running his business, he said.
Sharer, who first won election in 2000, said he was in favor of term limits early in his tenure. In the subsequent decades, though, he said he’s learned that legislative staffers “know everything” and is concerned that term limits would “in essence, turn the staff into the real governing body.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) A California union and a group of farm workers from around the country are suing to stop new, lower-wage federal guidelines that save money for farmers but cut pay for temporary foreign agriculture workers — hurting local laborers as a result, the suit alleges. 
In a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court, the United Farm Workers and 18 individual workers sued the U.S. Department of Labor over the October guidelines for laborers who are in the United States under temporary, H-2A visas. The new guidelines set lower wages — differentiating them by state — including pay cuts to account for the value of free housing provided by law to foreign workers. 
“Farm workers, and the rural communities across America they sustain, need and deserve fair wages and job security, not a race to the bottom with an endless supply of cheap foreign labor,” Teresa Romero, president of the United Farm Workers, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. 
Trump allows more foreign ag workers, eases off ICE raids on farms

The new Trump administration rules are “drastically cutting the minimum wage that U.S. employers must pay foreign farmworkers, all while costs and wages in other sectors have sharply increased,” the lawsuit states, adding that the lower pay for foreign workers will also force cuts for American workers. The lawsuit asks a federal judge in California to halt implementation of the guidelines and recalculate wages. 
The lawsuit also objects to first-time pay differentials based on the value of employer-provided housing. It alleges violations of laws requiring that foreign visas not affect wages of U.S. workers with similar jobs. 
The cuts “will severely impact farmworkers — some of the most vulnerable members of our society and many of whom already live in poverty,” according to the lawsuit. 
One worker, not identified by name, works in Missouri with an H-2A foreign worker visa was formerly paid $17.83 an hour and will suffer a $4.08 pay cut, leaving him unable to afford food and essential protective clothing for his job helping with squash, eggplant and other vegetables, according to the lawsuit. 
One worker, Irene Mendoza, a U.S. citizen, said in the lawsuit that her wages could be cut by $3.22 an hour, to $13.78, because of the guidelines, even though she doesn’t need a foreign worker visa, forcing her to get a second job to pay for food, housing and transportation between jobs in some of the states where she works. Mendoza said in the lawsuit that she works picking and packing green beans and potatoes in Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin.
Midwest farm economies suffered while some Sun Belt states kept rolling in early 2025

The lower wage guidelines vary by state and are subject to state minimum wage laws that could make them higher in some states. In North Carolina, for instance, the new hourly wage is $11.09 for less-skilled workers, compared with $16.16 last year, and $12.27 for local workers who don’t need housing, according to a Cornell University analysis.
The Department of Labor referred a Stateline request for comment to the Department of Justice, which declined comment. 
Some farmers and experts have hailed the new guidelines as lifesavers that will stave off bankruptcy as costs rise and some prices for their farm goods stay low. 
Almost half the H-2A visas in the 2025 fiscal year were in a small group of states including Florida (60,000), Georgia (44,000), California (37,000), Washington state (36,000) and North Carolina (28,000). The government expects an additional 119,000 visas to be issued under the new rule, on top of the nearly 420,000 a year issued in recent years. 
Public comments on the rule are open until Dec. 1.

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Washington state is fining health insurance giant Regence Blue Shield over half a million dollars for disparities between its mental health and medical coverage.
For years, Regence failed to provide the state with detailed documentation showing its behavioral health offerings are comparable to medical or surgical coverage, in violation of state and federal law. The data the company did provide showed major differences between the two types of care, including for in-network reimbursement rates, among other areas. 
“Throughout this process, Regence’s staff appeared to willfully misinterpret our questions, dismiss our concerns and generally disregard their own responsibilities to their members’ well-being,” state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer said in a statement.
Regence argued parity wasn’t an issue, but didn’t provide documentation to prove that, according to the Office of the Insurance Commissioner.
“The data Regence provided, or in some cases failed to provide, demonstrates a lack of accountability for following this nation’s insurance laws,” Kuderer said.
A Regence spokesperson said the company has “implemented state and federal requirements for behavioral health access in good faith, made necessary updates and will continue prioritizing compliance while supporting future rulemaking for clear, consistent standards.”
“Everyone should have access to high-quality behavioral health care,” spokesperson Ashley Bach said in an email. “We value our collaborative relationship with the Office of the Insurance Commissioner and worked diligently to provide comprehensive responses to the OIC’s inquiries.”
Under an order signed Friday and announced Monday, the insurer will pay the state $550,000. It’s the second major fine Kuderer’s office has issued over mental health coverage parity issues since she took office this year.
The money will go to Washington’s general fund, the main source of funding for state operations. Since 2001, the insurance commissioner’s office has sent over $44 million from fines like this back to state coffers.
Persistent parity problems
State and federal law require insurers to cover behavioral health treatment similar to physical health care. For example, an insurer can’t charge different co-pays for mental health treatment and physical health. And if there’s no limit on outpatient physical health care visits, there also can’t be a limit for mental health care.
Despite mental health parity laws, mental health coverage still often doesn’t stack up. 
A nationwide study last year found patients went out of network to see a behavioral health specialist 3.5 times more often than they did for physical health clinicians. For some types of care, the disparity was even greater. Going to out-of-network providers generally results in higher out-of-pocket costs.
And for those who stay in their insurers’ network, reimbursement rates were higher for physical health office visits than mental health appointments, the study found.
This year, Washington state legislators passed a bipartisan law aimed at bridging this divide. 
The new law, which takes effect in 2027, seeks to make clear that mental health and drug treatment are “medically necessary” care that insurance companies are required to cover. Insurers argued it would drive up premiums. 
Over the summer, Kuderer’s office similarly levied a $550,000 fine against Premera Blue Cross for not following mental health parity laws. The company’s online provider directory also didn’t comply with state law.
The insurance commissioner’s office has been scrutinizing mental health care parity among Washington insurers with the help of federal grants.
In 2023, the agency found similar violations at UnitedHealthcare, resulting in a $500,000 penalty.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration this year has paused new rules issued by former President Joe Biden that looked to strengthen mental health protections and hold insurance companies accountable for denying such coverage.
This is notable because many Washingtonians are subject to federal mental health parity laws, instead of the state’s. That includes those on Medicaid and workers on so-called “self-funded” plans whose employers directly pay for medical benefits, instead of through premiums to an insurance company.
This isn’t the first time the state has dinged Regence this year. 
Last month, Kuderer’s office fined the company $100,000 for denying over 950 claims for treatment due to a lack of prior authorization between June 2020 and May 2022. The care included physical, occupational, speech and hearing therapies.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/patty-kuderer-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 17:58:27.049744

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)A coalition of Democratic attorneys general is withdrawing one of their lawsuits filed in Rhode Island’s federal court after the Trump administration agreed to drop a rule that would have restricted aid for undocumented victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and a coalition of AGs from 19 other states on Monday submitted their motion to dismiss their complaint against the U.S. Department of Justice that sought to block the new “Legal Services Condition” that would have applied to grant programs under the Violence Against Women Act and  the Victims of Crime Act.
The lawsuit filed in Providence’s federal courthouse Oct. 1 argued the administration violated the U.S. Constitution’s Spending Clause, along with the Administrative Procedure Act, when creating the conditions barring nonprofits from administering legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status in this country.
AG coalition files suit in R.I. to block Trump from tying immigration status to victim service funds

States were notified of the rules on Aug. 18 via what the complaint called “surprise notices” informing them they could no longer provide legal services to undocumented immigrants with funding allotted to them through the federal grants.
Attorneys general argued that the restrictions would have strained victim services programs by forcing states to screen immigration status. The coalition also warned legal residents and U.S. citizens could also be denied help.
“With this agreement, the Trump Administration is effectively surrendering, as well they should, for attempting to withhold critical funding for victims of sexual and domestic violence,” Neronha said in a statement. “When a victim seeks help, the first question can never and will never be concerning their immigration status.”
But a Department of Justice Spokesperson in a statement still maintained that any grants funded by the agency cannot be used to provide services to undocumented migrants “unless otherwise required by federal law.”
“The Department of Justice will continue to ensure taxpayer dollars are used responsibly and for services that directly benefit Americans and lawful residents to prevent American taxpayers from being treated like second-class citizens,” the spokesperson said.
A separate suit against the DOJ and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to stop withholding Victims of Crime Act funding to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement remains ongoing in Rhode Island federal court.
But even as that lawsuit plays out, the DOJ has already posted its state-by-state allocations of the congressionally appropriated Victims of Crime Act — without any strings attached. Rhode Island will receive over $4.8 million for federal fiscal 2025. In federal fiscal 2024, the state received $3.3 million.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The legal wrangling in Utah’s ongoing redistricting saga isn’t over. 
In a flurry of more court filings last week, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson was again tasked with sorting through more issues with Utah’s congressional boundaries after Utah’s top election officials raised some technical issues with the new map. 
Split homes and other boundary issues in Sandy, Cottonwood Heights, Alpine, Highland, Orem, Huntsville and Summit County led the lieutenant governor’s office to ask the court for clarifications to Utah’s new map ahead of implementing it for the 2026 elections. 
Meanwhile, attorneys for the Utah Legislature — which continues to protest the state’s court-ordered redistricting process as a violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches — argued the lieutenant governor’s request for boundary clarifications “amplifies how these proceedings have transgressed the Utah and U.S. Constitutions,” they wrote in court filings. 
“Plaintiffs’ counsel can instruct the Lieutenant Governor how to resolve those issues. But in doing so, the constitutional problem — the denial of the Legislature’s constitutional authority to redistrict — only becomes more obvious,” legislative attorneys wrote.

Further, lawmakers’ attorneys argued the boundary issues “further reveal that there was no good reason” for the judge to choose the plaintiffs’ map over the Legislature’s map, arguing that the boundary issues resulted in a similar number of county and city splits as lawmakers’ preferred boundaries. 
Therefore, they argued the “only map approved in accordance with constitutional requirements” is the Legislature’s 2021 congressional map, and that Gibson should throw out the plaintiffs’ map, which she picked on Nov. 10. 
Months ago, Gibson issued a ruling voiding the 2021 map as the result of an unconstitutional process, ruling the Utah Legislature overstepped its constitutional authority when it undid a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4, which implemented an independent redistricting process. In that August ruling, Gibson restored Proposition 4 as Utah law, while ordering a “remedial” court process to enact a lawful map ahead of the 2026 elections. 
In that court-ordered process, Gibson ultimately picked a map submitted by the plaintiffs instead of the Legislature’s preferred map — ruling that lawmakers’ map, known as map C, didn’t adhere to Proposition 4’s neutral map-drawing criteria to the “greatest extent practicable.” The map she picked creates a compact congressional district in northern Salt Lake County — resulting in one Democratic-leaning district and three safe Republican districts. 
In response to the Legislature’s complaints against the new map, attorneys for the plaintiffs in the case argued that the boundary issues identified by the lieutenant governor — which were largely the result of annexations that took place after the 2020 census — were not out of the ordinary in redistricting and that the Legislature’s attorneys didn’t follow Utah’s rules of civil procedure when requesting the stay. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

“Ten days after this Court’s ruling — ten days in which an entire emergency appellate process could have commenced and completed — Legislative Defendants now suggest in three paragraphs at the end of an unrelated 10-page filing that the Court should stay its orders in this case and permit the 2021 congressional map to govern the 2026 election,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. 
“They seize on minor technical questions raised by the Lieutenant Governor — questions that arise with every redistricting map, are more prevalent in Map C, and exist in the 2021 congressional map — as the hook to belatedly raise this request,” they added, arguing it should be rejected. 
After hearing recommendations from both the lieutenant governor and the plaintiffs to remedy the boundary issues, Gibson on Friday issued an order implementing a minor fix to move a single home in Sandy from District 1 to District 4 to prevent a one-home precinct, which would have resulted in voter privacy issues. 
As for the boundary issues, Gibson deferred to the lieutenant governor’s discretion to make boundary clarifications when there is uncertainty. 
“The Court notes that Plaintiffs have suggested an approach to making determinations with respect to those issues and the Lieutenant Governor may take those suggestions into consideration when making determinations for implementation,” the judge wrote. “Likewise, as the Lieutenant Governor notes, the Utah Code grants discretion in making determinations should questions subsequently arise.”
Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

As for the Legislature’s complaints regarding the number of city splits, the judge noted that attorneys for both the plaintiffs and the Legislature agreed to use 2020 census files in the court’s “remedial” map-drawing proceedings. 
“For that reason, any municipal annexations that took place after the Census Bureau provided the 2020 municipal file did not factor into any analysis (by the parties, any experts or the Court) assessing the map proposals,” Gibson wrote. “Notably, no party raised any issues regarding any possible discrepancies between the 2020 municipal boundaries and current municipal boundaries.” 
Gibson issued her order last week while acknowledging that time is of the essence, with state election officials needing to implement the map with enough time for county clerks to finalize their precincts ahead of candidate filing opening in January.
The judge said she would explain her legal reasoning — as well as address the Legislature’s attorneys request for a stay — at a later date. 
“The Court will endeavor to issue that analysis as soon as possible,” Gibson wrote.

It’s the first major state facility set to be permanently relocated as a result of damage sustained in the devastating flooding of 2023.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s flood-prone hub for vehicle maintenance is getting a new home — on higher ground.","BERLIN — David Thurber was helping clean up the Vermont Agency of Transportation’s Central Garage in Berlin, days after flooding inundated the facility in July 2023, when he came across a drawer full of photos. The images gave him pause, he recalled in a recent interview. They showed the same location, decades prior, also flooded over.
It was a timely reminder, Thurber said, of something he and other agency leaders had long known to be true: The Central Garage, which has sat on the same site along U.S. Route 302 for the past seven decades, was long overdue to be relocated.
“It was like, no, we can’t keep doing this every five, or even 10, years,” said Thurber, who oversees the facility’s operations. “It would just be crazy.”

The Central Garage is the state’s nexus for outfitting and maintaining its snowplows, road graders, pickup trucks and almost “anything with a tire,” as Joe Flynn, the state secretary of transportation, put it. When the state gets a new plow, for instance, it often comes here first, where workers install key electronics and other finishing touches before sending it out to a regional hub in other parts of the state.
But like so many other pieces of state and local infrastructure in Vermont, the Berlin garage was built on land that’s highly susceptible to flooding. The facility is surrounded by water on two sides: The Stevens Branch of the Winooski River runs along its western edge, while the Pond Brook traces its southern boundary.
In July 2023, both those waterways leapt over their banks and flooded much of the facility with several feet of water, washing away tools, damaging vehicles, leaving offices full of mud and rendering many of the facility’s vehicle bays unusable.
As the old photos Thurber found show, however, that was far from a one-off. Todd Law, the transportation agency’s fleet division director, said his father, who also worked for the agency, remembered flooding at the Central Garage in the 1970s. The site has flooded more than half a dozen times since Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, Seven Days reported last year.
The damage in 2023, however, was “the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Flynn said in a recent interview, sitting in one of the facility’s few office spaces that wasn’t damaged in 2023.
Now, the transportation agency is in the early stages of building a new, more modern facility on an empty plot of land just over a mile away, still in the town of Berlin. The new garage — which would be far less prone to flooding — is slated to cost around $25 million, an amount the state hopes will be covered, at least in part, with recovery funding provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The project is notable because it is the first major state facility set to be permanently relocated as a result of damage from the flooding in July 2023, according to Doug Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer.
Plans also call for the existing garage facility to be torn down and its land to be turned into open space to help mitigate future flooding. The state has recently been working out the details of that process with the town of Berlin, where some local officials have raised concerns with the state’s plans for the new garage over the past year.

“It’s not going to alleviate all the flooding — but it can help,” Flynn said of the area around the current site. “It just makes sense.”
‘Just isn’t what it used to be’
The agency’s Central Garage is, in fact, a hodgepodge of different garages, sheds and small office buildings, with a large parking lot in between. Five structures on the site took significant damage in July 2023. One, a small shed, was essentially destroyed.
Flynn showed a reporter a photo he took of a dumpster flowing down Route 302 on the back of rushing floodwaters. The dumpster crashed through part of the facility’s fence, toppling it. “That’s how much force was behind it,” he said of the water.
On a given day, there are eight to 10 vehicles at the garage getting annual preventative maintenance, and four or five more in for finishing touches, such as getting the agency’s “VTrans” decals tacked on, according to Law. At times, there can be two dozen or more vehicle chassis parked in the lot outside waiting to be outfitted with new parts. 

On a recent morning, crews were doing routine maintenance ahead of the first major snowfall of the season. One snowplow was opened up to get new turbochargers installed; another was lifted into the air while a worker stood underneath, filling its differential fluid. A cruiser for the Department of Motor Vehicles police force was getting its winter tires put on.
After the July 2023 flooding, crews worked for about a month to get the Central Garage back to a state where it could service vehicles. Flynn said he and other agency leaders were impressed by how quickly the facility’s staff, along with other state workers, got it up and running again.
But there was a significant loss: the facility’s largest vehicle maintenance building took too much damage, largely to its electrical systems, for repairs to be cost efficient. The building still sits mostly empty today, except for some equipment that’s in storage.
As a result, the transportation agency has shifted much of its vehicle maintenance into an adjacent building that was previously used for storage, after putting in new ventilation and pumping systems there. That building sits at a higher elevation, so it saw almost no flooding in 2023 beyond some water lapping at its edges. 
A smaller building at the rear of the complex — just a stone’s throw from the Stevens Branch — has long housed several maintenance bays, too. It was also inundated with water in July 2023. But its key mechanical systems were elevated after a flood in a previous year, Thurber said, which made it easier to get the building back into service. 
Overall, the 2023 flood damage left fewer vehicle bays available for the Central Garage’s staff to work on snowplows and other trucks each day. That’s had a noticeable impact on its operations over the years since, said Andrew Casavant, the transportation agency’s Central Garage regional supervisor.
In a larger building, like the one that’s been unusable since 2023, parts could be easily swapped between two different vehicles that were being worked on at the same time, he said. That building also had a dedicated parts shop for easy access. Now, parts frequently have to be ferried across the facility’s parking lot, he said, which can be time consuming — and potentially dangerous when it’s raining or snowing outside. 
Having less space also means the facility’s staff are, sometimes, tripping over one another while working on vehicles, Casavant said. The crew have still been able to get done what they need to in recent years in the leadup to the winter, he said, but preparations have been inching closer to the start of the season than he’d like.

“The job’s still getting done, but it’s just not in the time frame that we would like,” Casavant said. “I’ll be honest. Our output just isn’t what it used to be.”
‘We couldn’t stay where we are’
Plans for a replacement garage facility are already well underway. 
In the 2024 legislative session, state lawmakers sent the agency $2 million to purchase a roughly 23-acre parcel off nearby Paine Turnpike for the project. Plans are to build a 53,000 square foot structure with 22 maintenance bays split into two wings, with parts storage in between.
The transportation agency considered about a dozen other sites for the project, according to Law, of the fleet division, including on land the state already owned, such as the nearby Edward F. Knapp State Airport.
Officials chose the site they did partly because it is adjacent to an existing state facility, the Berlin Vermont State Police barracks, on a site that formerly housed the state Department of Libraries, Flynn said. The state had considered buying the land that’s now slated for the central garage facility to be used as the state police barracks in the past, so it was already on his and other officials’ radar, he added.
The site also has access to a local municipal water and sewer system, which was another plus, Flynn said. He called the location “kind of serendipitous.”

The state bought the land later in 2024 from Superior Development Ltd. That company is owned by Wayne Lamberton and Randal LaGue, according to business records available on the Vermont Secretary of State’s website. Lamberton and LaGue have done business with the state before — they built the large rest area just off Interstate 89’s Berlin exit in a partnership with former Gov. Peter Shumlin’s administration.
Lamberton is a close friend of now-Gov. Phil Scott’s and has ties to a construction business Scott previously owned a portion of. Both Lamberton, and Superior Development Ltd., have contributed to some of Scott’s past political campaigns, according to campaign finance records on the secretary of state’s website. 
For instance, the company donated $4,000 to Scott’s 2016 gubernatorial campaign and made in-kind contributions totaling $1,000 to Scott’s 2018 campaign, records show.
Law said in an email that the agency’s decision to buy the new parcel had nothing to do with Scott’s relationship with those developers, and was instead entirely due to the merits of the site. He also noted, in an interview, that the transportation agency wanted to build the new facility close to the current one to make it easy for its employees to stay in their jobs.
At the local level, however, it hasn’t been an entirely smooth ride for the state’s plans. 
Last year, according to reporting from the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus, Flynn got a stiff reception to the plans from the Berlin Selectboard. That’s because the new garage would be built in the area Berlin wants to build a new, walkable town center, the paper reported, and some board members worried the garage project would be out-of-line with that vision.
But at a subsequent meeting, the board members softened their tone on the project and said they wouldn’t stand in the way of it, the Times Argus also reported.
Vince Conti, the Berlin town administrator, said last week that the town and the state have largely come to an understanding related to both the current and new garage sites. The plan is now to install a sidewalk along the new garage parcel, he said, paid for by the state as well as a federal grant the town already has access to.
Meanwhile, the town and state have drawn up an agreement saying the current garage site will be cleared for open space once the agency is able to relocate its operations, Conti said. He said the state will pay for soil cleanup work that needs to take place on the site from decades of use before that happens.
“I think there’s mixed feelings about it, probably both on the board and within the town as well,” Conti said. But he added the project was likely to advance, regardless.
Law said in an email he wasn’t aware of any outstanding points of disagreement between the town and state, and noted the town’s purview over the project was limited. 
Flynn said he and other state leaders hope that, by turning the Central Garage site into open space, they’ll be creating more “water storage” upstream of downtown Montpelier, which sits several miles west of the facility. He hopes that could help, even in a small way, reduce the impacts of future flooding that’s inevitable in the capital area.
To make that happen, the state is also relying on help from FEMA. The federal agency has a program to pay costs of relocating a structure when analysis determines that is more feasible than rebuilding on the original spot. Flynn hopes FEMA will pay as much as 80% of the project’s cost, though negotiations are still underway. 
Law, the fleet director, said he has been meeting with FEMA officials regularly and expects to know how much the federal government will contribute by mid-January. Those efforts come as the state is still reviewing estimates for how much FEMA will pay to help the state repair the 2023 damage to the complex of state offices in downtown Montpelier, according to Farnham, the state’s recovery officer.
The state hopes to break ground on the Central Garage project next year, with completion possible in 2028.
Law said even with details still to be worked out, he’s certain the state won’t be staying at its site on Route 302. He remembered standing with a group of state officials and surveying the post-storm damage in 2023.
“It became very clear, very quickly — for everybody that was down there — that we couldn’t stay where we are,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-24 21:31:26+00:00,CT Mirror,Revolution Wind work goes on as Trump administration misses deadline,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/ct-revolution-wind-ruling-appeal/,The Trump administration has missed the deadline to appeal a federal judge’s decision ordering work to resume on the Revolution Wind project.,"The Trump administration missed last week’s deadline to appeal a federal judge’s decision ordering work to resume on the Revolution Wind project, handing another victory to advocates and local officials who have fought to keep the project afloat.
Construction of the of the 704-megawatt wind farm — which is being staged from the State Pier in New London — was allowed to resume on Sept. 22 after U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that the federal government lacked justification when it halted work on the project earlier this year.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which issued the stop-work order, had 60 days to appeal the judge’s decision. That deadline passed on Friday, Nov. 21 with no action taken by the federal government. 
“The Trump administration is rightly choosing not to continue to defend the indefensible,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement Monday. “Trump’s erratic actions were the height of arbitrary and capricious government action, and their decision not to pursue this defense is further confirmation of that. This is a major win for Connecticut workers and Connecticut families.”
A BOEM spokesperson declined to comment Monday.
In response to a series of questions seeking clarity on whether the administration was dropping its opposition to Revolution Wind, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly provided a statement that included no mention of the project or the court ruling.
“In just a few months, President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and restored American energy dominance,” the statement read. “This means prioritizing the most effective and reliable tools to power our country, which includes following through on his promise to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ and unleash domestic oil, gas, and nuclear power — supporting thousands of good-paying energy jobs across the country.”
Revolution Wind was already 80% complete when the stop-work order was issued in August. All the foundations for the project’s massive turbines had been driven into the seafloor.
The Trump administration cited unspecified national security concerns as its rationale for halting the project. The project’s proponents said it had undergone extensive reviews during the years-long permitting process, which included approvals from the federal Department of Defense.
Revolution Wind’s developers, which include Danish energy company Ørsted, filed suit challenging the stop-work order in federal court in Washington, D.C.
Lamberth, the judge in the case, was appointed to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan. In remarks from the bench in September, Lamberth chided the the government for failing to provide evidence to support its order, which he called “the height of arbitrary and capricious action.”
“There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm,” Lamberth said, adding that the developers were required to meet strict deadlines to get the project up and running.
Since work resumed in September, the project has progressed to around 85% completion, according to Ørsted’s most recent quarterly earnings report. Construction is currently slated to finish in the second half of 2026.
A spokesperson for Revolution Wind declined to comment on the government’s decision not to appeal Lamberth’s ruling. 
A second lawsuit challenging the federal government’s action against Revolution Wind was filed in September by Tong and his counterpart in Rhode Island, Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha. That case remains pending as of Monday.
The project employs nearly 1,200 workers across both states, according to the lawsuit, including more than 100 jobs at the State Pier in New London. The wind farm itself is located in federal waters off the coast of Block Island.
Both Connecticut and Rhode Island also signed agreements to purchase the power produced by Revolution Wind once it is online. Under the terms of its contract, Connecticut’s utilities will purchase up to 304 megawatts for $99 per megawatt-hour.
Separately this week, another federal judge in Washington, D.C. is considering whether the Trump administration erred in its decision to halt all approvals for future offshore wind projects, according to Reuters. Trump announced that order as part of a flurry of executive actions upon his return to office on Jan. 20.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Revolution-installed-turbine-082025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

(Photo via Google Earth)Over the past five years, there have been at least 15 cases of Iowa nursing home workers being accused of taking photos or videos that violated residents’ right to privacy and dignity, an Iowa Capital Dispatch review of state records shows.
The most recent case involves a northern Iowa nursing home that was cited for failing to report an employee’s allegations that a caregiver streamed video of a partially undressed resident to the social-media platform Snapchat.
The Nora Springs Care Center, which is 10 miles east of Mason City, has been fined $500 for failing to report to the state inspections department an employee’s allegation of resident abuse.

According to state inspectors, a certified nursing assistant was working the evening shift on Sept. 6, 2025, when she went to the care center’s shower room to obtain a wheelchair. The CNA allegedly reported that after she knocked and opened the door to announce that she was entering the room, she saw another staffer in the room, kneeling down in front of a resident who had known cognitive issues.
The CNA allegedly reported she could see that a cell phone was propped up against the wall and was recording on the Snapchat app, a social media program that streams video but typically limits the viewability of the content to a brief period before it becomes inaccessible.

According to inspectors, the CNA alleged the worker who was kneeling in front of the resident appeared startled and quickly stood up. Upon fully entering the shower room, the CNA allegedly reported, she could see her own leg come into view on the video recording, and she could also see the resident’s leg on the phone screen.
She allegedly stated that after she grabbed the wheelchair, she turned back to leave the room, and her colleague was standing in the doorway with no cell phone in sight. At that point, the resident was sitting in a shower chair with a shirt and briefs on, but their pants were not fully on.
The CNA left the shower room and immediately reported the incident to the nurse on duty. The resident was interviewed by the care facility’s staff three days later and allegedly stated he had no concerns regarding improper treatment and had not witnessed any improper cellphone use.
According to inspectors, the facility conducted a “comprehensive investigation” that included interviews with the staffs and found “no evidence” to support the CNA’s allegations.
“To reinforce expectations and safeguard resident privacy, the facility has implemented robust staff re-education, increased supervision, and ongoing monitoring to ensure strict adherence to all cellphone-use and abuse-prevention policies,” state inspectors reported.
According to the inspectors, the facility’s administrator allegedly confirmed Nora Springs Care Center had not notified the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing of the incident as required.
Records show over 15 cases of media abuse
An Iowa Capital Dispatch review of state inspection records shows that since 2021, there have been at least 15 other instances of care facility workers taking photos or videos that resulted in the homes being cited for violating residents’ rights. In most of those cases, the photos or videos were shared with others via social media.
Among the cases:
Bishop Drumm Retirement Center, Johnston: In January 2024, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing cited this nursing home for four separate instances of social-media abuse.
In one instance, a male resident was photographed sitting in a wheelchair with a blue bonnet on his head with a caption underneath stating, “Like, why are you stealing my bonnet?”
In another instance, video was recorded of a resident sitting on a toilet with their pants around their ankles while an unidentified individual waved their stocking feet back and forth under the resident’s nose as the resident protested, saying, “Stop doing that, your feet stink.” A caption underneath the video read, “Gassed.”
In the third instance, a resident was photographed sitting on a toilet with their pants around their ankles with their shirt off and exposing one side of their breasts. A caption underneath the picture “was not able to be read,” inspectors reported.
In the fourth instance, inspectors reported that a video showed a resident of the home lying in bed with their eyes open and a blanket over them while another individual was “shaking their butt — twerking — in front of the resident’s face.”
The available records indicate each of the four residents was “exposed to social-media abuse by a member of staff,” but they don’t indicate how the photos or videos were shared, what social media platform was used or how many workers were involved.
No fines or penalties were imposed by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing as a result of the inspectors’ findings.
Good Samaritan Home, Algona: In November 2024, state officials cited this facility with failing to protect residents from personal degradation. The violation was tied to a video posted to social media of a CNA having a conversation with a resident sitting in her wheelchair in her room.
In the video, the worker was seen talking about being the resident’s friend, pulling the woman’s pants up and sitting on her lap. “You can clearly see and hear the resident in the video,” an employee who reported the matter allegedly told inspectors.










This man is literally dying.


– Caption to photo posted on social media by an Iowa caregiver 


In addition, inspectors reported that a dietary aide indicated she had received “a couple of videos” and photos from a former colleague, one of which showed a resident’s feet with a caption stating, “This man is literally dying.” Another photo was of a catheter bag with the caption, “The color of a resident’s p—.”
The Iowa Department of Inspections Appeals and Licensing imposed a $500 fine for resident abuse and the personal degradation of residents, plus a $500 fine for failing to adequately report resident abuse to state regulators.
Good Samaritan Home, Ottumwa: In August 2023, this facility was cited for failing to maintain residents’ personal privacy. A certified nursing assistant at the home had allegedly reported that she personally witnessed a colleague using the social media platforms TikTok live and FaceTime while at work and then, without disconnecting, entering residents’ rooms to provide personal care while livestreaming.
The CNA allegedly reported that on one such occasion, she heard her colleague state a resident’s name.  The home’s assistant director of nursing told inspectors no formal disciplinary action was taken, but there were “verbal discussions” about personal phone use during work hours.
Altoona Nursing and Rehabilitation Center: In August 2022, the state cited this facility for resident abuse related to video of a resident’s shredded brief that was shared with at least one other staffer. The state inspection report gives no indication as to whether the resident was visible in the video, but indicates that when a licensed practical nurse was informed of the matter she “went to the staff member who took the video and escorted that staff member out of the facility.”
Parkview Manor, Wellman: In January 2024, state inspectors cited this facility for failing to treat residents with dignity by posting a picture of a resident on social media. The undated photo showed a resident laying in bed, with her right arm visible, and papers and clothes strewn on the floor. The photo displayed “facebook.com” at the top, inspectors reported.
A dietary aide told inspectors she’d heard that a housekeeper posted a picture of a resident on social media, adding that she had then been asked to help remove the photo from the social media site. Another worker told inspectors she had visited a social media site and had seen three photos of “a resident’s room, which was a mess.”
National study completed last month
Last month, Colorado’s Long-Term Care Ombudsman published a report that examined 100 incidents of privacy violations in 30 states that took place between March 2017 and April 2025.
The incidents involved caregivers taking unauthorized photos and videos of residents and posting them to various social media platforms. The report cited “many disturbing incidents” of photos and videos “showing naked residents in compromised positions in their beds or in their bathrooms with feces on them, or verbal/mental or physical abuse of residents with demeaning captions.”










My mom has dementia for some time now. Why would he video her? Was he trying to embarrass her?


– Daughter of a resident at Karen Acres Center, Urbandale


The report indicates that of the 100 incidents that were examined by the Colorado ombudsman, six took place in Iowa. The report does not include the incidents referenced above that took place during the March 2017-April 2025 timeframe, although the incident at the Altoona home doesn’t appear to have involved any social media postings.
According to the ombudsman’s report, the homes with the most incidents of social-media abuse were Illinois, with nine; Michigan, with eight; and Minnesota, with seven.
Along with Iowa, the states of Ohio, Indiana, California, Kansas and Oklahoma each had six incidents detailed in the report.
The six Iowa incidents identified by the Colorado ombudsman are:
Karen Acres Center, Urbandale: Sometime in 2024, a worker recorded video of a female resident lying in bed, speaking random words, with her face visible in the video. The worker could be seen in the video, wearing a hoodie while rubbing his chin and rolling his eyes while the resident spoke in an incoherent manner.
The worker posted the video to Instagram with the words, “Everyone, say hi to (resident’s first name).” The resident’s daughter later told inspectors, “My mom has dementia for some time now. Why would he video her? Was he trying to embarrass her?”
The worker later explained his actions to investigators by saying he had been “chilling and talking” to the resident. “I videoed it and put it on my Instagram and let it out there,” alleging that he had seen others posting similar pictures and thought it was OK to do so. The home reported the matter to the state as required.
Clearview Home, Mount Ayr: In December 2022 or January 2023, a caregiver at the home recorded video of a male resident in bed tearing up his briefs. The worker later explained that she shot the video because she thought it was funny, and asserted that when she placed the phone in her pocket she accidentally uploaded the video to Snapchat.
An assistant administrator stated that initially management of the home dismissed the matter as “teenage drama” between the worker who shot the video and the worker who saw it on Snapchat, but months later, when another worker was alleged to have taken photos of a different resident, the investigation into the May 2023 incident was reopened and the employee admitted shooting the video. The home failed to report the matter to the state as required.
Accura Healthcare, Pleasantville: In March 2022, a CNA recorded video of herself reclining in a chair while a resident with dementia rubbed her feet. The video, uploaded to Snapchat, was titled “A real man.” The worker, who admitted the conduct, was suspended by the facility. The home failed to report the matter to the state as required.
Living Center West, Cedar Rapids: In November 2024, a worker uploaded to Snapchart video of a male resident holding an ice cream cone. The man, who had moderate cognitive impairment, appeared to be sitting in a wheelchair without his dentures in place, as a female asked, “Let me see your teeth.” The man then displayed a toothless smile and the female laughed. The home reported the matter to the state, but not in the required timeframe. The worker was fired.
Careage Hills Rehabilitation and Health Care, Cherokee: In February 2021, a CNA used Facebook to relay to others the details of a fatality in the home. (State inspection records describe the CNA’s communication as both a “post” to Facebook as well as a message sent using the Facebook’s Messenger app.)
The information shared by the CNA included the name of the resident who had died after falling out of a chair while being removed from the home’s whirlpool bath. The worker was counseled by the facility and given a verbal warning, according to inspectors.
Midlands Living Center, Council Bluffs: In September 2024, a nurse aide in training allegedly recorded video of a discussion between herself and a resident which she later uploaded to Snapchat. It showed the aide talking to a resident whose face and body were obscured so she could not be identified, but others later told inspectors they recognized the voice.
The resident could be heard asking for help with the nurse aide responding in a condescending and disrespectful tone, “I would be willing to help you, but you haven’t listened to me once this entire night. I can’t help you if you’re not going to listen to me.” The aide was fired. The home reported the matter to the state as required.
Social-media violations in other states
A total of 147 victims were identified as part of the Colorado Long-Term Care Ombudsman’s report. About 88% of the victims were reported to have some level of cognitive impairment.
While many state investigation reports didn’t reference the specific social media platform used by the caregivers, the most commonly named platform was Snapchat, followed by Facebook.
Among the incidents identified in states other than Iowa:
Colorado: A video showed a woman with severe cognitive impairment on the floor after falling off her bed while wearing only Depends. The caption on the video read: “How the f— did you end up here?”
Ohio: A video showed an African American woman with cerebral vascular disease seated on the toilet with feces running down her leg. A cartoon image of a nurse aide was placed over the woman’s face and upper torso. The caption on the video read: “Bruh, now I am pissed and ready to f-ing go.”










We have cardboard coffins.


– Oregon nursing home workers to a resident


Oregon: After a resident with dementia repeatedly expressed their desire to make funeral arrangements for an already-deceased relative, two CNAs recorded video of themselves pretending to be funeral home staff and offering the resident funeral-plan options. While laughing, they made comments such as, “We have cardboard coffins.”
Oklahoma: Two CNAs recorded video of themselves taunting a woman with dementia as they held down her hands and inserted their fingers, wet with saliva, into the woman’s ears.  The Snapchat video was shared with another employee of the home.
New York: A video showed a CNA pulling a wig off of a woman with dementia and then slapping her on her head with it.
Illinois: A video showed a CNA jiggling the loose skin and tissue on the back of the arm of a woman who had severe cognitive issues. The caption on the video read: “Don’t leave your family members with her, she plays with their skin.”
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley is a Republican from New Hartford, Iowa.
In 2016, following a spate of photo-related cases of nursing home abuse in Iowa and other states, U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa called on federal officials to take a more active role in fighting privacy violations of nursing home residents. In the wake of that effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent out a memo to state inspection agencies reminding them of residents’ privacy rights.
In 2024, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing reported that a review of inspection reports from 31 states showed evidence of abusive privacy violations involving 152 nursing home residents.
Writing in McKnight’s Long-Term Care News, Eilon Caspi stated that 85% of the victims had some level of cognitive impairment, and that the cases involved workers sharing on social media photos and videos of residents in a demeaning, humiliating or abusive manner.

Jones announced his candidacy for Alabama governor Monday afternoon. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones officially joined the race for Alabama’s governor Monday afternoon.
Jones posted a video to social media Monday where he confirmed the “worst kept secret” in Alabama. He also teased an official kickoff next month.
“Folks in Alabama deserve a governor who is going to fight for them,” he said. “What we’ve heard all along is that Alabama wants their next governor to be someone who lives here, who works here, who listens to the people of this state, who understands the people of this state.”
A message seeking comment from Jones was left Monday afternoon. Jones’ gubernatorial campaign was formally registered with the Alabama Secretary of State’s office early Monday afternoon. 
Alabama’s primaries are May 19.
Jones’ entry into the race likely sets up a rematch with U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who defeated Jones in the 2020 senatorial race and has largely cleared the field in the GOP gubernatorial race. It also gives Democrats their highest-profile gubernatorial candidate since Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox and Former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Sue Bell Cobb jockeyed for the nomination in 2018. 
A message seeking comment from Tuberville’s campaign was left Monday afternoon. Communications director for Tuberville’s campaign Mallory Jaspers posted to social media Monday morning that the governor’s race will yield similar results.
“This race is already over — but if Comrade Doug wants to get blown out again, be our guest,” Jaspers wrote. 
In a shot at residency questions that have dogged Tuberville for several years, Jones in his video said Alabama “wants their next governor to be someone who treats this state with grace and dignity, and not just like a rest stop on the way to the Florida beach.”
The path to the campaign
Rumors of Jones’ candidacy picked up over the weekend when the Voice of Alabama Politics reported Sunday that Jones would file the necessary paperwork to enter the race this week. Monday morning, staff at the Secretary of State’s Office said Jones’ campaign would not appear until it received the physical form with Jones’ signature in the mail. 
Jones is a former U.S. attorney who secured convictions against Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. in 2001  and Bobby Frank Cherry in 2002 for the murder of four little girls in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963. Both men were sentenced to life in prison. 
In 2017, Jones launched what at first appeared to be a longshot bid for U.S. Senate, promising to focus on “kitchen table issues” for Alabamians. In a December special election, Jones beat Republican nominee Roy Moore, a former Alabama chief justice who divided Republicans and faced accusations of sexual abuse and misconduct during the campaign. 
Despite outraising Tuberville in the 2020 election, Jones lost re-election by election results as President Donald Trump easily won Alabama and straight-ticket Republican voting pulled Tuberville ahead. After his defeat, Jones, a longtime supporter of Joe Biden, helped the Biden administration guide U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination through the U.S. Senate. 
Jones had been dropping hints of a gubernatorial run throughout the year. He endorsed and campaigned for Alex Braswell, a Democratic candidate in the House District 11 special election this summer. He hosted a town hall for Braswell, who was the first Democrat to run for the seat in nearly 20 years, in Cullman, his wife’s hometown.
Jones hinted at his run for governor at a town hall hosted by U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham, earlier this month.
Jones was also part of a discussion in October with former U.S. Attorney Bill Baxley where the pair of attorneys reflected on the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.
“At the time, it was a hope of race here in America. But today, it’s really a hope for everyone, given all that we’re doing,” Jones said at the event hosted by the Southern Poverty Law Center. “Even when I tried these cases years ago, immigration issues and other issues of hate will begin to bubble up. And today it’s really the hope of so many people that we can all live on this planet together, love each other a little bit more, (and) respect each other a hell of a lot more.”
Jones joins Will Boyd and Chad “Chig” Martin in the Democratic primary. Tuberville and Ken McFeeters make up the Republican primary so far.
Democrats face a tough battle for statewide office in Alabama. Jones, who was the first Democrat to win election to the U.S. Senate in 25 years, is the only Democrat to win a statewide vote for a political office since 2008, when former Public Service Commission President Lucy Baxley narrowly won election to the PSC. The last Democrat to win the governor’s mansion was Don Siegelman in 1998. Siegelman served a single term.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_0104-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

The evidence, ranging from a sexual assault kit to fingernail scrapings and strips of masking tape, is tied to the 2002 killing of a 6-year-old girl in Greenville.
If the evidence is lost, attorneys Jacob Howard and Adnan Sultan argue, their client King Young Brown Jr., should be exonerated.
Brown is incarcerated in the Marshall County Correctional Facility and serving two consecutive sentences — 30 years for rape and 20 for manslaughter. He was convicted in 2005 of raping and killing the child whom the attorneys refer to as R.W. in their motion. 
It was a day Gloria Brown, King Brown Jr.’s mother, remembers well. She said her life before that day was different. Her son was 15, and had never been arrested before. He will turn 39 in prison next month.
“I may not be behind bars, but I feel like I’m doing the time with him,” Gloria Brown told Mississippi Today.
For many years after the little girl’s death, the family of R.W. held a block party in her honor at H.T. Crosby Park, where she was last seen alive. Addie Cannon, R.W.’s aunt, misses her niece.
Cannon believes the state has the right man behind bars. 
“She was just a little shy child,” Cannon recalled. “I will always remember the way she said, ‘Hey auntie, come give me a hug.’”

Brown Jr.’s attorneys are appealing his convictions and hope a new analysis of the evidence will help to exonerate their client. They write that as recently as Aug. 29, 2023, the Washington County Circuit Clerk’s Office in Greenville had the evidence. 
On Sept. 16, Washington County Circuit Court Judge Richard A. Smith ordered Circuit Clerk Barbara Esters-Parker to ship the evidence within 30 days to Bode Technology, a Virginia-based company that provides forensic DNA analysis, including newer methods such as Touch DNA and Y-STR testing. Smith’s order also required Esters-Parker to email a copy of the shipping receipt.
But in a Nov. 6 court filing, Howard and Sultan allege that Esters-Parker can’t account for the evidence or the other exhibits.
“More than thirty (30) days have passed since the Court issued its Order and the Clerk has failed to ship the specified biological evidence to Bode Technology,” the attorneys wrote.
Esters-Parker and Deputy Clerk Cynthia Lakes declined to comment because of pending litigation.
If the evidence is not located, the attorneys argued, the court should vacate Brown Jr.’s convictions and drop the related charges, the attorneys wrote. 
On April 21, 2002, R.W. was found dead in a garbage bin that belonged to her grandmother’s neighbors — Brown Jr.  and his family. Brown Jr. was tried three times for the crimes. The first two trials resulted in hung juries. At the third trial, after over 13 hours of deliberation, a jury found Brown Jr. guilty of rape and manslaughter. 
“We remain hopeful that Mr. Brown will have the opportunity to establish his innocence through the DNA testing ordered by the circuit court,” said Sultan, an attorney at The Innocence Project who focuses on securing DNA testing for post-conviction cases and overturning wrongful convictions. Howard, senior counsel for the Mississippi office of the MacArthur Justice Center, also focuses on wrongful convictions.
Modern DNA testing
In their motion, Howard and Sultan said, “Law enforcement collected a wealth of biological evidence in this case that has never been subjected to DNA testing or that can be re-tested using more advanced technology.”
None of the hairs collected from Brown Jr.’s home that underwent microscopic comparison were linked to Webster or her “material relatives” the attorneys wrote. “The results of this testing were never presented to a jury.”
The prosecution’s case against Brown Jr. hinged on the testimony of a hair follicle expert who compared microscopic hairs found at the Brown home to those of the victim, the court filing reads.
There is also controversy over the accuracy of microscopic hair comparison. In 2016, then-FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter that FBI examiners made statements about the analysis that “went beyond the limits of science,” putting “more weight on a hair comparison than scientifically appropriate.”
In 1999, a Justice Department task force found that 96% of 150 cases involving microscopic hair analysis had flaws. In 2009, the National Academy of Science announced that microscopic hair analysis had “no scientific support.” After Innocence Project co-founder Peter Neufeld asked the FBI to review cases in which microscopic hair analysis had been used in evidence, the FBI established that every member of the agency’s 28-person hair and fiber unit had given flawed testimony in the 268 convictions that were reviewed. 
“In several cases in which microscopic hair comparison evidence was introduced, defendants were later exonerated by DNA after being convicted,” Comey wrote. “We want to make sure there aren’t other innocent people in jail based on our work.”

In R.W.’s case, the state did not submit for modern DNA analysis of any of the DNA evidence nor did prosecutors present it to a jury.
The analyst who inspected the fingernail scrapings from R.W.’s killing in 2005 conceded it was difficult then to make an accurate identification of the perpetrator given the capabilities of technology at that time. Modern DNA testing doesn’t require as large of a DNA sample to get a result. 
Some DNA testing was not used at Brown Jr.’s trial because the defense received the results too late to review them and get an expert in court, according to Howard’s and Sultan’s recent motion.
Earlier this year, on April 8, Assistant District Attorney Austin Frye  responded to a motion for post-conviction DNA testing by listing evidence he said was already presented to the jury including Brown Jr.’s fingerprints on both the outer ring of the garbage bag and garbage bags at his home, and DNA analysis results that proved Brown Jr.’s hairs matched those found in the inner and outer garbage bags of where R.W. was found. He also touted the results of microscopic hair comparison, and he said further DNA testing would not exonerate Brown Jr.
Frye did not address the issue that none of the hairs the state submitted from Brown Jr.’s home matched the victim or any of her material relatives. Frye could not be reached for comment by the time of publication.
Sultan and Howard explained that it would make logical sense that Brown Jr.’s hairs and fingerprints would be found in a garbage bin he along with his family used regularly.
A “wealth” of biological evidence suitable for modern DNA testing became available after Brown Jr.’s 2005 trial, said Huma Nasir, an expert the defense team retained who is a director at a private DNA analysis lab in Oklahoma City.
Howard and Sultan’s Nov. 6 motion asks the Washington County Circuit Court for a hearing to determine the chain of custody of the evidence and to have the circuit clerk and deputy clerk testify under oath.
A 2009 Mississippi law mandates preservation of all biological evidence in criminal cases with the court instructed to “impose appropriate remedies” and “order appropriate sanctions” in the case of violation. The law was amended in 2011 to clarify that when biological evidence needed to be destroyed, the incarcerated and their attorney should be notified along with other interested parties.
“Innocent people mistakenly convicted of the serious crimes for which biological evidence is probative cannot prove their innocence if such evidence is not accessible for testing in appropriate circumstances,” read the 2009 law.
Two decades of difficult memories
When R.W.’s killing made headlines in 2002, both the victim’s family and that of the accused were thrust into the media spotlight. The two families had been next-door neighbors for more than two decades.
For Gloria Brown, King Young Brown Jr.’s mother, the news of potentially missing evidence felt like a blow. She hopes that he will win his appeal. She and her stepfather say they were with Brown Jr. the night R.W. was killed. 
“I felt that it was the end for me, and didn’t feel like I’d survive it,” Gloria Brown said of her son’s trials and convictions. “But I had a lot of family support that helped me. I didn’t think I’d be able to be this strong.”

She says it was hard to watch the police search her home after the murder. Her late husband, King Brown Sr., was a well-respected city councilman in Greenville and known as a peacekeeper during contentious council meetings. She wasn’t accustomed to the scrutiny.
The recent motion about the missing evidence has also dredged up difficult memories for Cannon, R.W.’s aunt. She still remembers the mints that her sister, R.W.’s mother, would bring from Sonic Drive-In. Her niece loved them. Cannon also still remembers the scream she believes was hers on the night R.W. disappeared. 
Cannon remembers the shock of identifying her niece’s body over two decades ago. She is wary of the defense’s push to vacate King Young Brown Jr.’s conviction if the evidence is not located. 
“When my sister passed, that’s when it really took a big toll on me because I know that’s [the killing of R.W.] why she was sick,” Cannon said of R.W.’s other aunt. “And it’s still terrible, just the idea of him thinking that he needs to get out. You don’t need to be in the free world if you can do a child like that. You don’t need to be here.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21133628/IMG_3852.jpg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

(File photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)COLUMBIA — When Iris Barham’s great-grandfather started in the dairy business, he milked cows by hand and delivered the bottles door-to-door in Cherokee County.
Today, robots milk the cows on an Anderson County farm Barham runs with her father and brother.
In the future, Milky Way Farm hopes to install a robotic manure system to clean the barns, as well as an automated system to bottle-feed calves, said Barham.
Developing more of these types of technologies that make business easier and more profitable for South Carolina farmers are what a one-time grant program hopes to accomplish.
“Each step is to improve the welfare of the animals on our farm, but also to improve the quality of life of the people that are working our farm,” Barham said Monday at the announcement of a new program for farmers.
The Cultivating Innovation in SC Agribusiness Program, funded by a $600,000 donation from the Wells Fargo Foundation, will award 14 grants worth $30,000 each to farmers or startup companies with ideas for using technology to sustain South Carolina’s nearly $52 billion agriculture industry.
New SC law aims to preserve dwindling farmland

Applications open Dec. 1 and close just before midnight Feb. 2, 2026. An information webinar is scheduled for 4 p.m. Dec. 4.
“Our funding reflects a clear belief that supporting small farmers and agribusiness is essential to South Carolina’s economy and our future,” said Pam Bryant, a vice president of philanthropy at the Wells Fargo Foundation.
The grants act similar to seed money or an angel investment to help get projects started.
Barham told the SC Daily Gazette she intends to apply for a grant to help buy a robot to feed calves.
Beyond the $30,000 grants to the award winners, Wells Fargo’s donation also funds a series of training sessions, covering subjects such as intellectual property and how to fundraise for next steps after the initial grant round is over. Or, as in Barham’s case, how to keep growing the farm’s customer base so her daughter can one day take over as a fifth-generation dairy farmer.
The program will be jointly operated by the South Carolina Research Authority, state Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Small Business Administration-supported Small Business Development Center, headquartered at the University of South Carolina.
South Carolina’s Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers said technology and agriculture have become synonymous.
“We have technology using optics to grade peaches,” he said. “One of our great peach farms over in Edgefield County uses a scanner that I think replace as many as 20 people to grade the peaches.”
Other farms, he said, are using drones and infrared technology to monitor the health of crops and spray for weeds.
That type of technology has helped farmers stay in business amid rising costs, labor shortages and environmental conditions such as drought, Weathers said.
“Because of the challenges for agriculture, we have to think smarter going forward than we have up until today,” he said.
The state’s agriculture agency has a history of helping farmers through its Agribusiness Center for Research and Entrepreneurship (ACRE), founded in 2018. Those grants are capped at $25,000 each.
The Milky Way Farm, which has 120 dairy cows, was among the recipients in 2021. Barham said that helped buy a $200,000 robotic milker.
“It’s a drop in the bucket but every little bit helps,” she told the Daily Gazette.
In the most recent round, announced in May, a dozen farms were collectively awarded $200,000 in state funding.
That includes Kindlewood Farms in Walterboro, which spent its share on a greenhouse to extend the growing season for tomatoes sold to Lowcountry restaurants. Harvest Moon Farm and Flower in Pelzer used its portion to convert a yurt on its property into a farm store for its pick-your-own flower operation. And Old McCaskill’s Farm in Rembert used its funds to develop a line of freeze-dried meals made from produce grown and processed on the farm.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/robotic-milker-1024x749.jpg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)Bishop William Barber, North Carolina faith leaders and dozens of activists gathered at the N.C. General Assembly Monday to symbolically eulogize the thousands of people that they believe will die as a result of cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs.
Barber said communities are just now beginning to feel the impact of cuts from the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he has dubbed the “Big, Ugly, Deadly, Destructive Bill.” He said the refusal to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits could result in 51,000 American lives lost annually.
“Later this week, we will be releasing an open letter to every member of the General Assembly, demanding that every member put down partisan politics and pick up humanity,” said Barber.
Barber said he wants lawmakers to return to Raleigh for an emergency session to address ongoing state cuts to Medicaid and to urge Congress to pass the enhanced ACA subsidies that are set to expire on December 31, 2025.
Barber said the cuts to Medicaid, the loss of the health care tax credits, and the withholding of SNAP benefits during the federal government shutdown are all examples of “policy violence” inflicted on the most vulnerable.
Nikki Williams came downtown Raleigh Monday to take part in the symbolic eulogy, with the hope state legislators would understand the importance of strengthening the social safety net.
“I personally receive Medicaid, and without Medicaid, I can’t receive pain management. I can’t go to the dentist,” explained Williams. “I appreciate financial assistance, but it doesn’t cover everything.”

Pushing a rollator with a sign that read “Save Our Healthcare,” Williams shared that she has already heard from friends who have seen their monthly health insurance premiums double without the subsidies in place.
Williams believes those who may find themselves uninsured in the new year will simply turn to the emergency room for primary care. Those with insurance may find themselves paying more to offset the cost of the uninsured.
“Then that means everybody’s fees [cost] going up, so that the doctors can get paid,” said Williams.
It may be a legislative long shot to expect lawmakers to address the Medicaid funding gap before the end of the year, but Williams remains ever hopeful.
“It’s not about having the funds to do it. It’s about not having the willingness to do it,” Williams said. “And they should be ashamed because their people should come first. Their people put them in office. It’s their responsibility to protect them.”
North Carolina has cut payments to Medicaid providers from 3% to 10% this fall. Democratic Governor Josh Stein says those cuts are necessary because state lawmakers failed to fully fund the program. Stein has called on state House and Senate leaders to return to Raleigh and address the funding shortfall.
Republican state lawmakers say those cuts were premature and politically motivated. Both the House and Senate have separately approved plans to fully fund the Medicaid program, but have shown little willingness to reach a compromise that would end a months-long standoff. Earlier this month, Republican legislative leaders refused Stein’s call to hold a special session.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-24 20:59:44+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump’s ACA subsidy stance unclear as CT premium hikes loom,Katy Golvala and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/trumps-aca-subsidies-premium-hikes/,President Donald Trump was reportedly mulling the rollout of a health care proposal on Monday that could shake up last-minute negotiations.,"In 2008, Leslie Silverman was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. A divorce left her without health insurance, and she was grappling with a chronic disease, all while raising three young children. When the Affordable Care Act passed, it was a saving grace, she said.
“This insurance — this exchange — is a lifeline for so many,” Silverman said during a press conference in Hartford on Friday.
Like Silverman, more than 140,000 Connecticut residents are waiting to see if there will be an extension of the enhanced subsidies that help lower costs for Affordable Care Act health plans. They are set to expire on Dec. 31, and without congressional action, premiums are expected to rise for many in 2026.
Congress remains locked in a fierce debate over the fate of the tax credits, which were created under Democrats’ pandemic relief bill in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025. And as President Donald Trump was reportedly mulling the rollout of a health care proposal on Monday that could shake up last-minute negotiations, the path forward is in limbo just weeks out from the deadline.
The enhanced premium subsidies were in the spotlight throughout the 43-day government shutdown, with Democrats making their extension a key demand to end the stalemate.
If the subsidies lapse, Connecticut residents could see their premiums rise by an average of $2,380 per year — or about $198 a month — according to mid-October estimates provided by the state’s health care marketplace, Access Health CT. A household of four would see premiums rise by an average of over $10,000 per year.
Enrollees in Affordable Care Act plans can qualify for various subsidies to reduce health care costs based on their income. Households earning between 100% to 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for getting financial help to afford plans. The 2021 bill expanded eligibility to those who make more than 400% of the federal poverty level.
As part of a deal to end the shutdown, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., pledged to hold a vote on renewing the subsidies by the second week of December. While enough Democrats got behind it to reopen the government, most in the party — including all of Connecticut’s delegation — opposed it because it wouldn’t guarantee an extension. And House GOP leadership hasn’t made a commitment to schedule such a vote in the lower chamber.
Republicans haven’t coalesced around an alternative to the subsidies, but some got behind an early idea by Trump to send money directly to consumers that could be used to cover the cost of premiums. As debate over a solution intensifies in the days since the shutdown ended, he told Congress to “not waste your time and energy on anything else.”
“THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE $TRILLIONS, AND RIPPED OFF AMERICA LONG ENOUGH,” Trump wrote last week on the social media platform, Truth Social. 
Yet reports suggested Trump was warming to a temporary extension of the subsidies for another two years in a plan that was expected to be released on Monday. It also limits eligibility to those who make up to 700% of the federal poverty line.
While an announcement was never officially scheduled for Monday and the details were light, the forthcoming proposal was delayed as the framework started to get pushback from some congressional Republicans skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, according to MS Now.
That has left an already uncertain policy on even shakier ground heading into the final weeks of the year and an imminent deadline for the enhanced subsidies.
Advocates fear that if premiums go up dramatically, people who purchase plans through their state’s exchange will lower their coverage or drop it entirely. That means sicker individuals will remain on the rolls, which could drive up costs. Plus, those forgoing health insurance could end up relying more on emergency rooms if they get ill.
“Make no mistake, your health care cost will rise even if you think you’re fine, because the ripple effect will go through our entire health care system and our economy,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said.
Silverman, who currently works as an independent marketing consultant and still gets her insurance through Access Health CT, has considered several options if the subsidies expire. She said she could go without insurance, find a full-time job to qualify for employer-sponsored coverage or leave Connecticut altogether. She’s also thought about moving to a state where health plans are cheaper for people who are self-employed.
“I love where I live. I love my community,” Silverman, who lives in West Hartford, said. “It’s a really tough financial choice.”
But there is limited time for Congress to address the subsidies before the end of the year. Lawmakers are out of town this week for Thanksgiving, and when they return to Washington in December, they will only have three weeks in session before the rest of the holidays.
If they can’t find a resolution, that means the issue could slip into the next year and subsidies would go away. U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., insisted Democrats would keep pressuring Republicans to take it up. But GOP leadership in both the Senate and House control what votes come up on the floor, and the minority party has little recourse.
“When these premium increases go into effect in January, the pressure is just going to mount because that’s when the real misery happens,” Murphy said. “As that pressure builds and builds and builds, we will keep at it. We will keep pressing our Republican colleagues to come back to the table and to reinstate those subsidies, even if we do it in January, February, March. We can at least stem the full year impact of those rate increases.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ACA-SUBSIDIES-1124-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

Credit: AP Photo/Bruce Newman
It is Monday of Egg Bowl Week, and we are in unchartered territory – even for Lane Kiffin.
Rick Cleveland
 I mean this in two ways. First, his Ole Miss Rebels are 10-1 heading into the Egg Bowl, needing only a victory over 5-6 Mississippi State to either earn a bye or a first-round home game in the FBS playoffs. Ole Miss, for the first time since integration, is a legit national championship contender in late November. Secondly, 28 years into his coaching career at age 50, the immensely talented Kiffin has taken his otherwise tired act – that of narcissistic coaching diva – to a new level with his highly public flirtations with Florida and LSU.
Will Kiffin leave Ole Miss for Florida – or, more likely, LSU – or will he stay at Ole Miss and coach his team in the playoffs and beyond? It is almost as if he is a high school recruit, sitting at a press conference with three caps in front of him? Which will he choose?
I have no clue what will happen Friday in Starkville and then Saturday in Oxford when Kiffin’s decision is supposed to come, but clearly Kiffin already has worn out his welcome with a huge segment of Ole Miss faithful.
None of this is normal.
I do have a clue about this: If Kiffin chooses to leave Ole Miss and his team with it headed into the playoffs, that will be his everlasting legacy. He forever will be the coach who deserted his team at its moment of highest achievement.
Think about it, Brian Kelly was roundly criticized for leaving Notre Dame for LSU when the Irish were still under playoff consideration (not when they were already in). Kelly famously left Notre Dame because he thought LSU afforded him a better opportunity to coach a national championship team. We see how that turned out. Notre Dame, under Kelly’s successor, Marcus Freeman, has at least played for the national championship earlier this year. Meanwhile, LSU has fired Kelly, who never made the playoffs at Baton Rouge, and now the school is scheming every which way on how to not pay Kelly what’s left on his contract.
None of that would appear to matter to Kiffin, who seems completely oblivious to the image he portrays. That is a telling characteristic of a narcissist, a person who exhibits a grandiose sense of self-importance, a need for excessive admiration, a lack of empathy, and a sense of entitlement. A diva simply enjoys all the attention.
Many, including Kiffin’s former boss, Nick Saban, blame the current college football system for the situation Kiffin and Ole Miss find themselves in. And, yes, it is a bad system. But for my money what Kiffin is doing can’t all be blamed on the system.
Kiffin has spoken in the past about how OIe Miss and the Oxford community have been integral in his personal growth and transformation. He has gone so far as to say he needed Oxford and Ole Miss more than Oxford and Ole Miss have needed him. I would agree. But they have been good for each other. If Ole Miss wins Friday, as the Rebels are favored to do, that will make 50 victories over the past five seasons. Yes, Kiffin, an offensive genius, has been good for Oxford. Ole Miss enrollment is up nearly 17 percent over that period. Coincidence? No.
But then Ole Miss has compensated Kiffin royally for his success. He makes nearly $10 million a year, more than twice what any Ole Miss coach has made before him. The university has raised his assistants’ salary pool to a point where it is competitive with any. Ole Miss has been on the cutting edge in NIL compensation for its football athletes. Ole Miss held its nose and abided Kiffin’s well publicized dalliance with Auburn three years ago – one that ruined another promising season – and has given Kiffin almost a blank check for what he needs to compete with the nation’s football powerhouses. What’s more, Keith Carter has pledged to provide even more. And yet Kiffin’s family has made quite public visits to Gainesville and Baton Rouge to check out schools and neighborhoods. Said one of my most loyal friends, a zealous Ole Miss fan for more than six decades, “I just wish Lane wouldn’t rub our faces in it.”
Kiffin, however, is oblivious.
One person, whose opinion I highly value, tells me I am overreacting to Kiffin’s public waffling. He says the Ole Miss-Lane Kiffin situation is the new normal in college athletics. He says the coaches are mercenaries and the players are mercenaries, as well. Get used to it.
Further, he says, “The days of college coaches and athletes caring for the school as much as the fans and alumni are over, gone forever.“
The more I think about it, the more I realize he is correct. But I don’t have to like it. And I don’t.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/21135351/AP25290045208644.jpg,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486

But at least in Comey’s case, in which charges were brought on the eve of the statute of limitations expiring, that appeared unlikely.120-day clockU.S. attorneys are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, but the attorney general can appoint someone on an interim basis for 120 days. After that, the judges in the district are responsible for appointing an interim prosecutor.“Ms. Halligan was not appointed in a manner consistent with this framework,” Currie wrote.Bondi appointed Erik Siebert as the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in January, while his confirmation was pending in the Senate. After 120 days, the judges in the district allowed him to continue.Siebert resigned in September, reportedly under pressure from Trump and Bondi to bring charges against Comey. Bondi then named Halligan, at the time a White House aide who had also worked for Trump in a private capacity, as the interim U.S. attorney. But Bondi could not do that because, after 120 days, the responsibility for naming an interim U.S. attorney fell to the district court judges, Currie wrote.“The 120-day clock began running with Mr. Siebert’s appointment on Jan. 21, 2025,” she wrote. “When that clock expired on May 21, 2025, so too did the Attorney General’s appointment authority. Consequently, I conclude that the Attorney General’s attempt to install Ms. Halligan as Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was invalid and that Ms. Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role.”Quick indictmentHalligan, after gaining office in September, quickly secured a two-count indictment against the former FBI chief from a grand jury in Alexandria. Comey was accused of lying to Congress about whether he had authorized a press leak of information related to an FBI investigation of Russian actors’ involvement in Trump’s first presidential campaign. However, U.S. District Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick wrote last week that issues with evidence, testimony and statements to the grand jury in the case outweighed the usual heavily guarded secrecy of proceedings. He said “profound investigative missteps” could result in the dismissal of Comey’s indictment.Comey has pleaded not guilty.James won more than $300 million in a civil case against Trump related to business fraud, though a state appeals court later overturned the sentence as overly punitive.Trump has publicly blasted James and Comey as using the mechanisms of legal proceedings to persecute him. In an extraordinary public message to Bondi just before Halligan replaced Siebert, Trump complained that the prosecutions against both were not developing faster.The Justice Department did not respond to a message seeking comment Monday.",,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486

(Photos by John Partipilo)With one week until the Dec. 2 special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, the money is pouring in, signaling both parties think the race is competitive. 
Former Tennessee General Services Commission Matt Van Epps, a Republican, was slightly favored by most political rating organizations to defeat state Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Democrat, in the special election to replace retired former U.S. Rep. Mark Green. The district was redrawn in 2022 to include parts of Nashville, Clarksville, and a swath of rural and suburban Tennessee counties with strong GOP leanings. Green won the district in 2022 and 2024 by nearly identical 20-percentage point margins. 
But as President Donald Trump’s approval rating has steadily dropped over the last few months because of the government shutdown, his handling of SNAP benefits and the impacts of tariffs on farmers and consumers, the Democratic Party has sensed an opportunity. 
Political action committees, PACs, tied to Democratic donors have spent almost $1.8 million in the race to help Behn, and Republican-tied PACs have spent $2.3 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings as of Nov. 24. The latest spending in the general election comes after nearly $3 million was mostly to help ensure a Van Epps victory. 
Of the $4.1 million spent so far, more than two-thirds has been spent on negative advertising about Behn and Van Epps. 
For Democrats, the vast majority of their PAC money has been spent by two groups: HMP and Your Community PAC.
The largest individual donors to HMP this year are Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain, and Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix. The HMP PAC also received a significant contribution from the House Majority Forward, a campaign arm of U.S. House Democratic leadership. 
Your Community PAC’s money doesn’t link back to an individual donor but to a group called North Fund, whose donors are untraceable. The North Fund, as of 2024, was run by a Washington, D.C. consultant named Jim Gerstein, who has served as a pollster and independent expenditure campaign organizer in support of several Democratic Party candidates. 
For Republicans, MAGA Inc. has spent nearly $1.2 million in the race, with Club for Growth and  Conservatives for American Excellence spending a combined $1 million. 
MAGA Inc. is Trump’s primary PAC, whose largest individual donors this year are Jeff Yass, a billionaire investor who most notably owns a significant stake in Chinese social video company TikTok, and Kelcy Warren, the billionaire owner of Energy Transfer Partners. 
Conservatives for American Excellence spent around $600,000 in the primary to help Van Epps. The organization has received most of its donations from Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, billionaire owners of two hedge funds.
Club For Growth’s main backers are Yass and Virginia James, a long-time conservative donor and supporter of private school vouchers. Club for Growth also funds the School Freedom Fund, which spent around $850,000 to help Van Epps in the primary and spent more than $3.3 million in 2024 to elect a slate of pro-private-school voucher supporters to Tennessee’s state legislature.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/behn-vanepps.jpg,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, visits Normandy, France, in 2023 to commemorate the 79th anniversary of the D-Day invasion during World War II and to pay respects to 9,386 American soldiers buried at Normandy American Cemetery. (Submitted)TOPEKA — The U.S. Senate passed a bill introduced by Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran to establish a 10-year program to identify Jewish-American servicemembers interred in cemeteries overseas with markers that didn’t properly indicate the individual’s religious heritage.
The measure sent to the U.S. House would allocate $500,000 annually to the American Battle Monuments Commission for research on members of the armed forces who could have been mistakenly memorialized. The commission would be responsible for contacting surviving descendants to determine whether the family was able to confirm an error and, if so, decide whether to have the grave marker replaced.
Operation Benjamin, a nonprofit organization working to preserve memories of Jewish-American men and women who gave their lives in World War II, estimated at least 600 had been incorrectly buried overseas under a Latin cross rather than a Star of David.
“All veterans, especially Jewish-American veterans who have served and sacrificed for our nation’s freedoms, deserve to have their faith accurately represented at their final resting places,” Moran said. “This legislation makes certain that the religious heritage of those who have died for our country is rightfully represented at their gravesites and gives their families the lasting comfort of knowing their loved one’s faith is recognized and memorialized with dignity and truth.”
The legislation was introduced in April by Moran, chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nevada. The bill was cosponsored by 18 Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, but not U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican.
“I’m glad to see that our bipartisan legislation to make sure our servicemembers and their faith are correctly reflected at their gravesites has passed the Senate,” Rosen said.
Rosen said the nation should make certain fallen veterans were honored with “dignity and and accuracy at their final resting place.”
Under the Senate’s version of the Fallen Servicemembers Religious Heritage Restoration Act, the battle monuments commission wouldn’t conduct a rededication ceremony and replace a marker without permission of a decedent’s next of kin.
During World War II, soldiers were given the option of having their religious affiliation noted on U.S. military dog tags. A soldier could have a “C” for Catholic, “P” for Protestant or “H” for Hebrew. In some instances, Jewish-American servicemembers misrepresented their religious faith when issued a dog tag or defaced the identification tag before combat because of concern German soldiers would treat captured Jewish troops harshly.
Another issue was injuries to deceased soldiers could be so significant that military personnel couldn’t be identified or their religious background was obscured.
In 2022, the American Battle Monuments Commission, in coordination with Operation Benjamin, engaged in the kind of remedy the Senate bill was designed to support. The commission and organization replaced Latin cross headstones marking graves of seven Jewish-American service members with Stars of David during services at Epinal American Cemetery in France and three other American cemeteries in Europe.
The commission said the group included Army Private Marvin Ashkenas, a Bloomfield, N.J., native killed in action Oct. 3, 1944. He was born in New York City to Russian-Jewish immigrants and enlisted in 1942. His tags were lost and he was placed in a temporary grave during a nondenominational ceremony. When he was moved to Epinal American Cemetery his religion was listed as “unknown” and his gravesite incorrectly marked with a Latin cross.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Moran-photo-normandy-2023.jpg,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486

Phil Murphy's final energy master plan maintains the state's commitments to cutting fossil fuel sources and focusing on renewables. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy’s vision for New Jersey energy policy remained mostly unchanged in a new version of the state’s energy master plan released Monday.
Though the new plan places less emphasis on wind energy than the 2019 master plan it succeeds, the document unveiled Monday continues to urge New Jersey to build renewable generation and slowly phase out fossil plants to meet energy and emissions goals over the coming decades.
“This report is the culmination of our no-regrets strategy to tackling the challenges of energy affordability, supply and demand, and climate change,” Murphy said in a statement. “I am proud of all that we’ve been able to achieve to make our energy sector cleaner and more efficient over the past eight years. This report’s recommendations will help guide energy policy to new heights in the future.”
Governor Murphy’s energy policy scrutinized as his two terms wrap up

Murphy, a Democrat, leaves office on Jan. 20 after two terms as governor, and another Democrat, Mikie Sherrill, is set to succeed him.
The state’s energy master plan is a policy document whose drafting is mandated by law, though it has no force of law on its own. Its recommendations and framework do not bind lawmakers, but legislators have previously advanced bills to enshrine parts of the 2019 plan in law.
The new plan maintains Murphy’s goal of having New Jersey generate 100% of its electricity from renewable or low-emitting sources by 2035.
That includes a planned phase-out of natural gas plants, which accounted for about 48% of the state’s energy generation in 2023. Mirroring some past proposals, the energy master plan calls for the state to bar the creation of new gas plants and allow existing ones to shut down rather than be renewed.
The plan allows natural gas plants using renewable biofuels under some scenarios, and some gas plants would persist through at least 2050.
Republican lawmakers — and even some Democrats — have criticized the administration for shuttering some of the state’s existing fossil fuel plants without replacements on hand. They said natural gas should be a part of New Jersey’s energy mix.
The plan’s call for renewables differs somewhat from the one issued in 2019. Mainly, the more recent plan places less emphasis on wind generation.
Murphy made wind a key pillar of his energy policy, but the projects not killed by economic headwinds are stalled following a federal permitting and leasing freeze instituted by President Donald Trump’s administration.
Eric Miller, executive director of the state’s climate action and green economy office, said the administration wanted to be sure the new master plan “was responding to the world as it is, not as we want it to be.”
The plan urges New Jersey to continue advocacy before PJM Interconnection, which operates the grid that serves New Jersey and 12 other states. Democrats have said delays in PJM’s interconnection queue are to blame for recent electricity price increases.
Those increases are tied to surging demand spurred by artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth energy needs following decades of largely level electricity demand.
The plan says New Jersey could help offset those increases by raising income limits on certain utility assistance programs, raising caps on some existing programs’ awards, and potentially tying electricity prices to the time of day.
The plan says New Jersey could continue to weigh the benefits of levying additional fixed charges based on ratepayers’ income, but stops short of proposing that the state do so.
It also maintains dramatic goals for building electrification. Each of the plan’s scenarios would require full electric heating by 2050 in the residential and commercial sectors, though the plan would allow at least some amount of gas heating.
Likewise, it maintains ambitious goals on vehicle electrification. Under each scenario, New Jersey would maintain an existing policy that seeks to phase out the sale of new gas-burning light-duty cars by 2035.
“We are doing everything within our control to expand state programs. We work closely with the utilities so we can expand their programs so that we can continue to expand our EV incentives, expand EV adoption, and most importantly, enhance a lot of the EV infrastructure development that we’ve already started on,” said Preethy Thangaraj, the climate action office’s deputy director.
Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in New Jersey, accounting for 35% of state emissions in 2021, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. That level at least doubled emissions from other sources apart from electricity generation, which accounted for 18% of 2021’s emissions.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3N2A6964-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486
,DC,2025-11-24 20:16:41+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Press access to Oval Office argued in case involving Trump and wire service,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/press-access-oval-office-argued-case-involving-trump-and-wire-service,,"WASHINGTON — A three-judge federal appeals panel grilled lawyers for a former White House official and The Associated Press Monday in a case that could significantly overhaul press access to the Oval Office and Air Force One.The two sides sparred over whether the president, in this case President Donald Trump, has sole discretion over which reporters can take part in the press pool in certain White House spaces, based on a journalist’s or their employer’s viewpoint.The dispute between the Trump administration and the AP erupted earlier this year after the wire service refused to use the term Gulf of America, designated by Trump, for the body of water the AP continued to call the Gulf of Mexico. Judges Robert L. Wilkins, Gregory G. Katsas and Neomi Rao, for the U.S. Appeals Court for the D.C. Circuit, poked holes in each side’s arguments on whether the First Amendment stops at the Oval Office doors or the tarmac outside Air Force One, and if the president can decide who’s included or excluded.The press pool is a small, rotating group of reporters, specified in advance, who travel with or attend events hosted by the president. They then send dispatches to hundreds of other journalists, and often publish quickly about the president’s activities.The Department of Justice’s Yaakov Roth argued that because of legal precedent, the administration cannot ban a larger group of “bona fide journalists” from using White House media passes to access the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, where press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other administration officials take questions from reporters.However, he argued, the president is well within his bounds to exclude reporters from his “personal spaces,” including the Oval Office or Air Force One, which are strictly “by invitation only.”Katsas, appointed during Trump’s first administration, asked, “Do you really want a room-by-room, space-by-space, jurisprudence? It’s really about access to the president. Is it really different if an event is moved from the Oval Office to the Rose Garden?”“If the president did an event in the (Brady) briefing room, we wouldn’t be having the same argument,” replied Roth, principal deputy attorney general for the DOJ’s civil division.Wilkins, appointed in 2014 by President Barack Obama, pressed further and asked if the White House is permitted to “revoke” a journalist’s media pass.Roth answered that “viewpoint discrimination is not permitted” when issuing passes and opening up access to the Brady room.“The question here is does that carry over (to the Oval Office or Air Force One)? I think the answer to that is no,” Roth said.The Oval Office doorIn his opening statement, AP attorney Charles Tobin argued, “The First Amendment does not stop at the Oval Office door” and that a “system” has been established in which the president cannot ban a reporter from spaces where the press pool is permitted. For example, recent Cabinet meetings and Oval Office visits by foreign leaders have been open to the press pool.“If it’s a pooled event, then the president cannot pick and choose,” said Tobin, of the firm Ballard Spahr.Katsas pressed back, asking, “How does the president get to pick who will come to the Oval Office for (a private) event?”Tobin replied with the hypothetical example of Trump inviting conservative media personality Tucker Carlson for a one-on-one interview. “It’s not a pooled event,” he said.Tobin continued his argument that the pool system was established under President Dwight Eisenhower and has since become “a defined government program.”Rao responded skeptically to Tobin, “you’re resting your whole argument” on the White House not having any say over the pool who follows the president.“It’s not some fixed thing. It’s changed over time,” said Rao, who was appointed by President Joe Biden in 2019.“It’s a government program. It must be administered in a viewpoint neutral (manner),” Tobin replied.“Does the White House determine whether an event is a press pool event?” Katsas followed up.“They do that all the time, your honor. It’s a defined government program,” Tobin replied.Katsas pushed back: “If you win on that theory, then the next day the White House can stop designating events as pooled events.”Wire service banThe Associated Press sued the former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich and other press staff for banning the wire service from events in the Oval Office and other spaces after Trump disagreed with an editorial decision by the wire service.Shortly after Trump renamed the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, the AP issued style guidance instructing journalists to continue using the body of water’s established name, but to add a note that the president had changed it on U.S. maps and government documents.The AP sets style standards for journalists across the industry.The case has been winding through the federal courts since February.Budowich left the administration in September.The White House began denying the AP entry to the Oval Office, East Room and other places on Feb. 11.Leavitt announced in late February that White House officials would take over pool rotation decisions from the White House Correspondents Association, a member organization that has self-governed journalist rotations and briefing seats placement since the Eisenhower administration.",,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486

In August, WyoFile profiled a Cuban man being held in the Natrona County jail during a grueling imprisonment by ICE. A reporter recently caught up with the man, who is now in Mexico. 
The post From a Casper jail to an unknown land, a Cuban man’s deportation saga continues appeared first on WyoFile .","Josue Rodriguez Perez, a Cuban immigrant who spent 40 days in the Natrona County jail during his months-long imprisonment by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, was deported to Mexico in September. 
Today, he is sharing an apartment in the seaside vacation destination of Cancun alongside other deported Cubans. But Rodriguez is on no vacation. The federal government cast him into Mexico, a nation to which he had no ties, and he has essentially become a man without a country. His legal status in Mexico is in question, the career he built as a commercial truck driver with a valid U.S. work permit is over and he is separated from his wife and family.
Sharpening that separation is Rodriguez’s inability to enter the United States, while his brother fights an aggressive cancer that has spread throughout his body, Rodriguez said during a recent phone interview with WyoFile.  
Rodriguez spends much of his days walking around in a foreign land, trying not to let his mind wander, he said. “Every day I feel sad,” he said, “it’s hard to think.” 
WyoFile profiled Rodriguez in late August during his time in the Natrona County Detention Center, where ICE deposited him while they tried to find a country that would take the Cuban immigrant.
ICE agents detained Rodriguez at a federal office in Miami when he went to renew a work permit that had allowed him to live and earn in the United States since 2017. Rodriguez and his father fled Cuba, where an authoritarian government squashes independent political activity, tightly controls the press and limits freedom of speech, in 1993 and were granted legal U.S. residency.
But after a tragic car accident upended Rodriguez’s life and led him down a path of addiction, the Cuban man went to a Louisiana state prison in 2012. The felony ruptured his legal residency, but since Cuba won’t accept most deportees from the U.S., a diplomatic antagonist, the federal government allowed Rodriguez to stay. 
He served his sentence and emerged from prison reformed. He married and became a truck driver who criss-crossed his adopted country. He has not been charged with any new crimes. 
President Donald Trump’s second administration upended that life. Though the Trump administration says it’s targeting undocumented immigrants who are committing crimes and are public safety threats, the federal government has, in reality, been seeking to deport broad swathes of immigrants, including by changing laws and policies to categorize some groups in the country legally as subject to deportation. 
Unlike past presidents, Trump wants to deport people to third-party countries like Mexico. When Rodriguez showed up to renew his work permit, he was detained and moved around the country in shackles, in what seemed to him like cruel randomness. He spent time at ICE detention centers in Florida and Texas before landing in Aurora, Colorado, and then Casper’s jail. 
He does not remember his long stay there fondly. “That was hell for me,” Rodriguez said. 
ICE brought Rodriguez to the Natrona County jail on July 18 as part of a group of more than 40 detained immigrants. As of Friday morning, 12 of those people remained incarcerated there, four months later. 
Fearing interminable imprisonment, Rodriguez signed an agreement allowing him to be deported to a third country — but for weeks, the federal government seemed unable to find a place to send him. 
Josue Rodriguez stands in front of a monument in Cancun to the Cuban poet and philosopher Jose Marti, a leader in the country’s struggle for independence from Spain. The inscription on the monument can be translated to: ‘I am a son of America, to her I am bound.’ (courtesy photo/Josue Rodriguez)
He never went before an immigration judge during his detainment, he told WyoFile. In June, the United States Supreme Court overruled a lower federal judge and allowed the Trump administration to pursue third-country deportations. The high court’s decision came via its emergency, or “shadow,” docket, through which the court issues brief, often unexplained orders on requests from the president for legal permission to proceed with a policy despite unresolved legal challenges. 
In late August, as WyoFile was preparing to publish a story about Rodriguez’s imprisonment, ICE moved him and other Cuban detainees again, this time to El Paso, Texas. On Sept. 9, he was taken across the Mexican border. Rodriguez described a harrowing journey, including two men on his bus into Mexico who refused to get off in the strange new land and were beaten by a security contractor. 
There were kind guards, too, Rodriguez said. He remembered one guard in Aurora, an employee of the private prison company GAO, who told Rodriguez he had already served his time for the crimes he committed in 2012 and did not deserve to be in prison again. 
After months in the hands of ICE, Rodriguez described his reception by Mexican authorities as welcoming, and a deep relief. He got a hot meal and a hot shower. Though he stayed in a jail cell, the door was unlocked. But then, he was released into Mexico, without a passport or identification. Instead, he was provided t a piece of paper that gave him 10 days in the country. He still has not been able to secure an identification. 
Rodriguez and the other Cubans who made their way to Cancun faced exorbitant prices from locals capitalizing on the influx of confused strangers arriving in their country. Amnesty International has decried third-country deportation as a denial of due process and a human rights abuse that is placing people in unsafe conditions. The human rights organization reported in September that the U.S. has deported more than 5,700 non-Mexicans to that country this year. 
At one point, Rodriguez said, he and his now roommates were defrauded out of $2,000, money mostly sent by relatives they had left behind in the United States, as they tried to find housing. 
His wife has visited him in Mexico, and they spent four days and nights together, he said. But she is employed in the U.S., and it’s not realistic for her to uproot to Mexico and be with him more permanently. 
“It’s hard to think that we’re not going to be together anymore,” he said. The sharper pain today, he said, is the fear that he won’t get a chance to see his brother alive. Rodriguez, for now, is trying to figure out where he can safely stay in the long term and what he will do for work. He is buoyed in part by fellowship with his roommates, the other displaced Cubans. “We take care of each other,” he said, “we respect each other and we love each other.”
He has dim hopes of being able to return to the United States. The big rig truck he sunk tens of thousands of dollars into has been repossessed by the bank he had taken a loan from to start his career, he said. 
Perhaps the president who follows Trump will “want to make up for what Trump did,” Rodriguez said. It’s his best hope for a legal pathway back to Florida and his family, he said. “We were good,” he said of himself and other Cubans in his situation. “We were working, we were paying taxes, we were helping.”

A 30-year-old political newcomer, who acknowledges that he’s skipped voting in past Republican primaries, entered the GOP primary for governor Monday by comparing the President Donald Trump-endorsed candidate Byron Donalds, who is Black, to a “slave.”
James Fishback met with reporters shortly after filing his paperwork and tore into Donalds, a U.S. representative from Naples, as someone beholden to corporate interests, including those in the tech sector. 
He called Donalds — who could become Florida’s first Black governor — a “slave” and spotlighted his arrests when he was a college student more than 20 years ago.
“Bryon Donalds is a slave. He is a slave to his donors. He is a slave to the corporate interests, to the tech bros that want to run our state into, in his own words, a financial capital,” said Fishback, an investment firm founder and the son of a bus driver. He lives in Madison.
“Why not be an agricultural capital? Why not be a farming capital? Why not be a citrus capital? Again, why do we have to become a financial capital? He wants turn Florida into Dubai, Singapore, or Hong King. We like Florida just the way it is.”
Fishback runs Azoria Capital, which made news recently when two of its exchange-traded funds were liquidated following a lawsuit against Fishback by his former employer, Greenlight Capital. 
A fourth-generation Floridian who grew up in south Florida, Fishback shone a spotlight on the differences between himself and Donalds, a transplant from Brooklyn, New York, who came to Tallahassee to attend college.
Fishback accused Donalds of spending the past week in Washington, D.C., meeting with “tech bros” and promising to speed up construction of artificial intelligence data centers and quantum computing in Florida. By contrast, Fishback promised that as governor he would “cancel and stop the construction of any AI data center.”
“I have yet to find a Floridian, whether it’s in Marianna, Miami, Pensacola, or Pahokee, who has pulled me aside and said, ‘Please work with Byron Donalds to speed up the data centers. We want our water supply to be intoxicated [sic]. We want to pay double for our electric bills,” Fishback said.

In addition, Fishback’s platform includes clamping down on Blackstone Inc. and Airbnb’s Florida homebuying; abolishing homestead property taxes across Florida; and eliminating the use of H-1B visas. Those go to overseas candidates with college degrees who don’t intend to immigrate permanently but could take highly skilled positions that U.S. companies struggle to fill. 
Gov. Ron DeSantis last month said the Board of Governors should fully “pull the plug” on the visas.

“I’m going to completely and totally end the H-1B scam. The H-1B scale and the corresponding alphabet letter soup of immigration visas allows foreigners from India, China, anywhere in the world to come here and to steal jobs from qualified Floridians. That ends on Day One,” Fishback said.
He promised to build upon the governor’s immigration enforcement efforts and work “hand in hand with President Trump “to ramp up mass deportations.” Fishback alleged there are 1.4 million people illegally in Florida “occupying homes that Floridians could occupy and they need to leave.”

Fishback focused on what he called his affordability agenda but also took repeated shots at Donalds, highlighting a 1997 marijuana charge that was dismissed as part of a pre-trial diversion program and a bribery charge in 2000 that was later expunged from his record.
“It was right here in Leon County that he was arrested and charged with selling marijuana and it was right here in Leon County where he was arrested and charged for bribery. So, I’m sorry. Byron Donalds is utterly disqualified. The people of Florida know that. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be losing in the polls to undecided even though he’s been in the race now for nine months,” Fishback said. 
Fishback referenced a poll from The American Promise that shows 43% of 800 respondents support Donalds, while half of those polled, 51%, remains undecided. 
(Fishback drew less than 1% support in the poll of 800 respondents conducted Nov. 17-19. Former House Speaker Paul Renner had 2% support and Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, who has not announced his candidacy, had 1% support.)
“You know what that tells me? Floridians are hungry,” Fishback said, “and Floridians want a real fighter. They want a fighter like President Trump, like Gov. DeSantis, who’s not going to make excuses.”
Fishback called Trump the “greatest president in U.S. history” and said he still hopes to earn Trump’s support in the August 2026 Republican primary, as well as the support of Gov. DeSantis, who will be term limited out of office, and First Lady Casey DeSantis.
Ryan Smith, chief strategist for the Byron Donalds for Governor Campaign, dismissed Fishback’s assertions that Donalds won’t win.
“Byron Donalds will be Florida’s next governor because he is the proven conservative fighter endorsed by President Trump. Anyone running against him is an anti Trump RINO [Republican in name only] and will get crushed in the Republican primary,” Smith said in a text to the Florida Phoenix.
Fishback’s Monday press conference came as a news report surfaced that he unsuccessfully pressed the Trump administration for an appointment on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

(Photo by Russ Taylor/National Park Service)Alaska commercial fishers caught much more salmon in 2025 than they did last year, but the money they earned was modest, according to the statewide harvest report.
The state commercial salmon haul totaled 194.8 million fish, the 12th largest since 1985, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s preliminary annual summary, released this month.
Measured in pounds, the 2025 harvest was about average compared to the last 40 years the agency has been keeping an all-species record, the Fish and Game summary said.
But the amount of money paid to harvesters delivering their fish – known as ex-vessel value – was the 13th lowest since 1975, when adjusted for inflation. This year’s total was $541 million, the department said.

This year’s totals represent a big improvement from last year, when only 101.2 million salmon were harvested. It was the third lowest haul since 1985 and the ex-vessel value was $304 million, the third lowest since 1975 when adjusted for inflation. In weight, the 2024 harvest totaled 450 million pounds, the lowest on record.
Alaska salmon, particularly Chinook, have been shrinking in size over the past decades, a trend that scientists attribute to a variety of factors, including climate change and ocean conditions.
This year, sockeye salmon accounted for the most value among Alaska’s five salmon species, continuing the long-term pattern in the industry. A little over a quarter of the landed fish were sockeye, but they made up 58% of the value, according to the Department of Fish and Game’s summary.
Pink salmon, the most plentiful and cheapest of the Alaska species, made up 61% of the total fish harvested and 21% of the total ex-value. The pink salmon harvest was about 14% less than expected at the start of the season, the department said.
At the other end of the volume spectrum, the statewide Chinook harvest, which accounted for only 181,892 of the 194.8 million total, was 26% higher than predicted in the preseason forecast, the department said.
Chum salmon accounted for 10% of the harvest and coho accounted for 1%, the department said.
The harvest totals are preliminary and subject to revision as more information is received, the department said.

,DC,2025-11-24 19:29:46+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Pentagon investigates Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly after he appears in video blasted by Trump,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pentagon-investigates-arizona-sen-mark-kelly-after-he-appears-video-blasted-trump,,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense announced on social media Monday it's looking into “serious allegations of misconduct” against Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, one of several lawmakers who posted a video last week telling military members they are not required to follow orders that violate the law. The video spurred anger from President Donald Trump, who posted, also on social media, that he believed the video from six Democratic lawmakers represented “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”The claim led to safety concerns on Capitol Hill, especially after a year that included numerous acts of violence against lawmakers and key political figures. The Defense Department announcement didn’t detail exactly how Kelly may have violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice but stated that “a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.” It was unclear how the military review and threat of court-martial proceedings would fit with the constitutional protections held by members of Congress for speech and debate.Kelly wrote in a statement the Defense Department’s post was the first time he’d heard about the inquiry. “If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work,” Kelly wrote. “I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”Kelly military backgroundKelly served as an aviator in the United States Navy from 1987 until 2012. He was deployed as part of Operation Desert Storm during the first Gulf War. He received several awards throughout his military career, including the Legion of Merit and the Distinguished Flying Cross. Kelly reached the rank of captain before his retirement from military service. Kelly, who was also a NASA astronaut, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in November 2020. The Defense Department’s post announcing an investigation into Kelly said military officials wanted to remind people that “military retirees remain subject to the UCMJ for applicable offenses, and federal laws such as 18 U.S.C. § 2387 prohibit actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces.”The statement added that all service members “have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful.  A servicemember’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order.”The statement appeared somewhat similar to the one Kelly, Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, Pennsylvania Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and New Hampshire Rep. Maggie Goodlander gave in the video they published Nov 18. The Democrats, all of whom served in the military or worked in intelligence agencies, said they wanted “to speak directly to members of the military and the intelligence community who take risks each day to keep Americans safe.”They said that Americans in those institutions “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”Broad constitutional protections for CongressMembers of Congress are broadly protected under the speech and debate clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states that unless a lawmaker is involved in treason, felony and breach of the peace, they are “privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.”The annotated explanation of the clause on Congress’ official website says the Supreme Court has “broadly” interpreted its applications over the years to ensure an independent legislative branch. “Despite uncertainty at the margins, it is well established that the Clause serves to secure the independence of the federal legislature by providing Members of Congress and their aides with immunity from criminal prosecutions or civil suits that stem from acts taken within the legislative sphere,” it states. “As succinctly described by the Court, the Clause’s immunity from liability applies ‘even though their conduct, if performed in other than legislative contexts, would in itself be unconstitutional or otherwise contrary to criminal or civil statutes.’ This general immunity principle forms the core of the protections afforded by the Clause.”A report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service states the judiciary’s “immunity principle protects Members from ‘intimidation by the executive’ or a ‘hostile judiciary’ by prohibiting both the executive and judicial powers from being used to improperly influence or harass legislators.”",,,,2025-11-24 14:58:05.956999

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)About three dozen protestors rallied outside the Kentucky Capitol Annex Monday to call on lawmakers to support food and health care assistance for low-wage workers and people in poverty.
The “Moral Monday” protest was part of events held across 16 states by Repairers of the Breach, a national organization that focuses on social justice. In Frankfort, those who attended the protest held signs focusing on Kentuckians who are at risk of losing Medicaid coverage and SNAP, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, benefits as a result of the Republican-backed spending bill approved by Congress earlier this year. 
Speakers included faith leaders from around Kentucky. At the end of the event, the protestors dropped off letters to state lawmakers and planned to follow up with emails and phone calls. 
While legislators are not currently meeting, the Kentucky General Assembly will reconvene in January. Lawmakers must then decide the next two-year state budget, including how to fund various programs and resources. 
Sandra Scott, a leader with VOCAL-KY, said she and others attended the rally to raise awareness about the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid. 
“We are all equal. Let them walk a day in our shoes and see how much they keep cutting all these benefits that are helping to protect us,” Scott said of politicians who supported the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Pastor Rich Gianzero, the incoming executive director of the Kentucky Council of Churches, said, “we have an unjust and unrighteous situation going on in the country right now and in the commonwealth.” Asked what kind of message he hoped lawmakers took away from the protest, Gianzero said they should stop “the obsession with the culture wars” and focus on solutions to help people who are experiencing poverty in Kentucky. 
“For so many legislators here in the Capitol who go to church or will quote a Bible — and in January, they’re going to quote Martin Luther King Jr. — and I’m asking myself and asking them to start doing the things that Jesus of Nazareth and Martin Luther King Jr. talked about,” Gianzero said. “Take action. Be about something.” 
Gianzero encouraged Kentuckians to “pay attention” to elected officials at the state and local levels “and speak out if you are troubled or bothered by different things you’re seeing or hearing.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5440-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 14:58:05.956999

In 2016, anti-LGBTQ+ extremists broke into the apartment of Bangladesh’s only LGBTQ+ magazine editor, Xulhaz Mannan, and murdered him and friend Mahbub Rabbi Tonoy. Tara Asgar was there, but she managed to escape.
She needed to get out of Bangladesh.
“I was a queer, gender-nonconforming person with no institutional protection, navigating state systems that were openly hostile toward people like me,” Asgar said. “Leaving Bangladesh became less a decision and more a fight for survival.”
It was three difficult months before Asgar got a one-year visa to the United States. She fled to Maine. The move was complicated. It likely saved her life, but she was entering a country on the brink of electing Donald Trump after a presidential campaign based on hostility to immigrants, one that was starting to debate if transgender and gender-nonconforming people should be allowed in public spaces.
“The American discourse around trans rights was fracturing along partisan lines; visibility was increasing at the same time as backlash,” said Asgar. “This country is not a uniform ‘safe haven’ for queer or trans people. It is a place where safety is uneven and always entangled with race, class, immigration status, and geography. Visibility here carries its own risks.”
Accurate historical data on LGBTQ+ immigrants is scarce. Today, it is estimated that approximately 1.3 million queer immigrants live in the United States, and that 3 percent of all immigrants identify as LGBTQ+.
But immigrating to the United States as an LGBTQ+ person has never been easy. In fact, for most of American history, officials have used sexual orientation and gender identity to exclude large swaths of migrants.
The official ban on LGBTQ+ people migrating to the United States was struck down 35 years ago this month. But LGBTQ+ people remained largely blocked for the next four years due to homophobic laws and policy, according to Karma Chávez, professor of Mexican American and Latina/o Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Still, many LGBTQ+ people have held up the United States as a beacon of hope, regardless of anti-gay laws.
“You know, I think people find things are very different when they get here, but the idea of a certain kind of freedom that Americans supposedly enjoy looms large,”  Chávez said.
Tracing exactly how long the United States has blocked LGBTQ+ migration is a little trickier, she said. That’s partly because the laws preventing queer immigration were not explicit. Moreover, immigration officials have long relied on LGBTQ+ stereotypes in determining if an applicant is queer, say experts, making it hard to determine if a person who is not allowed into the country truly identifies that way or has just been perceived as such by officials.
 The 1800s

Many experts say the first attempt to block LGBTQ+ people came in 1875 with the Page Law. The Page Law barred women deemed “undesirable,” such as convicts and laborers, and specifically targeted Asian women.
“A big part of the restrictions in the Page Law was to keep out ‘sexually promiscuous’ Asian women who were likely to become public charges because they didn’t have men to take care of them, and then they were going to engage in deviant behavior to survive,” Chávez said.
Though not specifically about LGBTQ+ people, language that was sexually specific was seen as the first snag that might catch LGBTQ+ immigrants trying to enter the country.
 Through the 1980s

The Immigration Act of 1917 barred “people with abnormal sexual instincts,” a convoluted way of saying gay and lesbian people. Chávez and others said this was the first law that directly targeted sexual minorities.
The government would more strongly reiterate these views in 1952 during the Cold War with the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to Aaron Morris, executive director at Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that fights for LGBTQ+ immigrants.
“Thinking about 1952 and where America was at the time, fast forward to 1965 when we’re looking at the civil rights movement, the gay liberation movement, women’s movements, there’s a lot happening in the 60s, and then the law becomes much more focused to ban people who are suffering from ‘sexual deviation,’” Morris said.
Queer people were again barred entry in 1965 by the Immigration Reform Act as “aliens afflicted with sexual deviation.” But 1972 brought relief because the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.
By 1980, the United States was finally ready to change its rules when it came to LGBTQ+ immigrants
Two things happened that year. The first was that the Refugee Act expanded the legal definition of refugee to include people being persecuted because they were part of a protected group. This did not explicitly include queer people, although some would argue that it should. The other thing that happened was the Mariel boatlift, a mass migration of 125,000 Cuban asylum seekers to the United States.
“Many of the people that came were transsexuals, homosexuals, people who would be considered sexual deviants,” Chávez said. “In the U.S., we sort of opened the flood gates, really testing out our core Cold War values when it comes to asylum.”
The LGBTQ+ people who won asylum from the crisis got asylum based on their persecution by the Communist Party, not their sexual orientation or gender identity, Chávez said.
“But this [claim of asylum based on being LGBTQ+] begins to get tested in a bit more formal sense throughout the 80s,” said Chávez. “And there are some cases of people who do attempt it.”
The results were mixed, with some prevailing and others failing.
 Lifting the ban

The Immigration Act of 1990, signed into law by President George H. W. Bush, would mark the most significant stride for LGBTQ+ immigrants yet. The law officially repealed the ban on queer migrants. But it fell short of allowing most queer people to seek safety within the United States, noted Jenny Pizer, senior attorney at Lambda Legal.
That’s because the law required that family sponsors be related by blood or marriage, something many queer families didn’t have.
“Allowing a lot more people to come as immigrants was not helpful to members of our community with a relation where the family relationship required marriage,” said Pizer.
 The cases that made the law

That same year, the Board of Immigration Appeal awarded humanitarian protection to a man by the name of Fidel Armando Toboso-Alfonso, who faced abuse in his native Cuba for being gay.
Four years later, in 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno issued an order stating that his case set a precedent. From that moment on, the order said, a person who had been persecuted by their government for being homosexual may be eligible for asylum in the United States. That opened the door for LGBTQ+ people to immigrate to the United States and seek asylum.
Three years later, another watershed moment came in the case of Pitcherskaia v. INS. Alla Konstantinova Pitcherskaia sought asylum relief in the United States after Russian authorities tried to “cure” her of being a lesbian using electric shock therapies. Though the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed that the shock treatments were meant to “cure” her, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed that decision and Pitcherskaia prevailed in her claim.
Another precedent-setting case came in 2000 when Geovanni Hernandez-Montiel, a 21-year-old gay man from Mexico, won his asylum claim in the United States, bolstering similar claims by other LGBTQ+ immigrants. Still, it would be another 15 years before the Supreme Court affirmed marriage equality in 2015, allowing queer spouses to sponsor each other for immigration purposes.
For transgender immigrants, the journey to legal entry in the United States was more complicated.
As Morris put it, “the Board of Immigration Appeals, which was doing more marriage-based stuff, was having a hard time deciding when someone was in a same-sex marriage or was in a different gender marriage,” Morris said.
The board’s first solution was to effectively ban transgender people from claiming asylum in the United States, Morris said. Asylum lawyers countered, saying the ban was discriminatory and overly broad. The board struck down the ban in 2004, although a policy allowing trans people to legally enter the country didn’t take effect until 2007.
It took, however, four more years for the United States to remove its mandate that trans migrants get gender-affirming surgery before migrating in their lived gender or sponsor opposite-gender spouses.
 The reality now

Today, LGBTQ+ people enjoy marriage equality and other federal benefits, but some worry that those laws face challenges in the courts, imperiling queer immigration rights.
In a recent opinion piece in Time, Fernando Chang-Muy, a professor at Pennsylvania Carey Law School , and high school senior Sebastian Irausquin-Petit argued that the country has abdicated its responsibility to queer asylum seekers by pursuing homophobic and transphobic policies under the Trump administration.
The authors point out that Trump ordered transgender and nonbinary identities erased from federal documents.
“Because the asylum process demands consistency across forms, nonbinary refugees now face an impossible choice: misrepresent themselves on paper or risk rejection for ‘inconsistency,’” they wrote.
Asgar still lives in that reality. Nearly 10 years after immigrating, she is still waiting for an asylum interview.
“Outside the U.S., there is a persistent belief that being queer or trans can act as a kind of exceptional category, that transness itself fast-tracks one’s journey to citizenship,” she said.
But being an immigrant has been like a second closet for her, one where she must prove over and over again that her story is tragic enough to earn her entry into the United States.
“As a trans migrant, my body is already a site of border-crossing: between genders, between cultures, between systems of recognition and misrecognition,” she said. “For me, the experience of being a trans migrant is shaped by this tension, between the freedoms I chase and the limits I confront, between the borders that confine me and the borderless kinship I come from.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/conversion-therapy-SCOTUS.jpg,,,2025-11-24 14:58:05.956999

March of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on research and advocacy for maternal and infant health, ranked Oklahoma as 46th in infant mortality, with 341 babies dying before their first birthday in 2023. 
This rate is 1.7 times higher in Oklahoma for babies born to Black mothers. 
Leading causes of infant deaths include birth defects, low birth and preterm birth weights, sudden unexpected infant death and accidents, according to the report. 
The state ranks 31st for maternal mortality, with more than 27 births per 1,000 resulting in the death of the mother within six weeks of the pregnancy ending due to complications related to the pregnancy or childbirth. 
Oklahoma is one of 12 states with no change from last year in preterm births, but still ranks 37th in the U.S. in this category. The state’s preterm birth rate was stagnant at 11%.
Oklahoma is one of 16 states to receive a “D”. Eight states and Puerto Rico received an “F.” 
The United States overall received a “D+” grade, according to the national report card. 
Oklahoma City, with an 11.2% rate of preterm births, was given a “D-” and Tulsa had an “F” with an 11.9% rate. 
Over 14% of births received inadequate prenatal care, meaning mothers began seeking prenatal care at their fifth month of pregnancy or had less than half of the appropriate number of health care visits. 
Nearly 50% of births in Oklahoma, about 23,700 in 2024, were covered by SoonerCare, the state’s Medicaid program. 
The report found that Oklahoma is currently implementing most of the “supportive maternal and infant health initiatives” recommended by March of Dimes to improve outcomes. 
The adopted policies include expansion of Medicaid and Medicare, reimbursing doula care with Medicaid and using a state level maternal mortality review committee. 
Requiring employers to offer paid family leave and requiring providers to screen Medicaid-insured patients for postpartum depression are policies the group recommends that Oklahoma has not adopted.

,DC,2025-11-24 19:14:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene retirement launches speculation about congressional pensions,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-retirement-launches-speculation-about-congressional-pensions,,"WASHINGTON — Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s upcoming resignation from Congress set off a series of questions and misinformation about what health care and pension benefits lawmakers receive once they leave public service. The system is a bit complex and determined by when a lawmaker entered Congress as well as how long they stayed. Members must serve at least five years, putting Greene just over the eligibility line when she officially steps aside in January. Members of Congress elected after 1984 are covered under the Federal Employees’ Retirement System. The four House lawmakers and one senator elected before then may be under the Civil Service Retirement System, so their benefit may be calculated differently than that of their colleagues.  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service explains in a report about lawmakers’ retirement benefits that “pensions, like those of other federal employees, are financed through a combination of employee and employer contributions.” “Under both CSRS and FERS, Members of Congress are eligible for a pension at the age of 62 if they have completed at least 5 years of service,” the report states. “Members are eligible for a pension at age 50 if they have completed 20 years of service, or at any age after completing 25 years of service. The amount of the pension depends on length of service (as measured in months) and the average of the highest three years of salary. By law, the starting amount of a Member’s retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of his or her final salary.”All members also must pay into Social Security, and how much in taxes they pay and benefits they receive are the same as for all beneficiaries.Members of Congress, except for leadership, are paid $174,000 a year.Greene, who began her congressional career on Jan. 3, 2021, will be just over the five-year requirement when she formally resigns on Jan. 5. Greene will receive about $8,700 in pension benefits per year for the rest of her life, after she turns 62. She is now 51.Former U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was first sworn in on June 2, 1987, after winning a special election, will receive considerably more in pension benefits given that she was a member for decades longer than Greene and had a higher salary during her time in leadership. The National Taxpayers Union Foundation expects Pelosi will receive an annual pension of $107,860 after she retires in January 2027. Health insurance benefitsMembers of Congress who retire or resign are eligible to purchase health insurance from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program as long as they had health insurance from the District of Columbia’s Affordable Care Act marketplace “for the five years of service immediately prior to retirement,” according to a different CRS report. While in Congress, lawmakers are eligible to have some of their health coverage offset by their employer — the federal government — as long as they purchase it through the D.C. marketplace, known as DC Health Link. Like others in the states, it was created by the Affordable Care Act.As with group health insurance plans, the amount subsidized by the federal government depends on whether a lawmaker selects a health plan that covers themselves or themselves plus eligible family members.",,,,2025-11-24 14:58:05.956999

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Energy has been playing keepaway with its customers on prospective bill discounts: proffered, then abruptly pulled away. 
But ratepayers can at last secure possession of alternative cost savings approved by state regulators Monday. 
The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s unanimous decision dips into existing pots of money from utility customer charges for energy efficiency and storm preparedness measures, while temporarily suspending those same charges from customers’ electric bills for the first three months of the year. The end result is an estimated $32 in monthly savings from January to March for electric customers, based on the average residential customer who uses 500 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, according to calculations submitted by Rhode Island Energy.
“The combination of the credits and rate reductions are intended to align with Gov. McKee’s laser-focused effort to encourage rate relief for Rhode Islanders for this winter,” Ronald Gerwatowski, commission chairman, said during the meeting.
The three-member utility panel first sought public feedback in July on how to mitigate the winter spikes in electricity prices amid growing fury from lawmakers, community advocates and residents struggling to afford rising winter bills. 
The same day the commission published its notice seeking ideas, Rhode Island Energy executives unveiled its own discount plan. Credits to customers were required by state regulators under the 2022 sale of state gas and electric operations from National Grid to Rhode Island Energy’s parent company, PPL Corp. But company executives and Gov. Dan McKee hatched a plan to speed up and concentrate the credits over the next two winters, rather than dispersing smaller discounts over a much longer period of time.
The proposal would have slashed customers’ electric bills by $20 to $30 per month, and cut gas bills by $40 to $50 per month, from January to March 2026 and again in the same three months of 2027 — the coldest and most expensive time of year. 
But on Nov. 14, the day before a hearing on its proposal, Rhode Island Energy yanked the plan, citing “unexpected and unwarranted opposition.” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office accused the company of “lowballing” its customers by undervaluing the mandatory discounts, while state utility regulators demanded more information. 
The sudden withdrawal put the prospect of rate relief in limbo, with McKee blasting the company’s about-face as “flat-out unacceptable.”
McKee maintained that Rhode Island Energy’s plan was better because it extended the discounts for two winters, not one, and also helped with gas bills. And the best solution would have been both for both discount plans to advance simultaneously.
“That is what should have happened to provide broader and more significant relief to Rhode Islanders,” McKee said in an emailed response Monday.

‘Sizable’ rate hikes loom
Rhode Island Energy will still have to fulfill the state-imposed requirement to credit customers for tax and accounting changes tied to the 2022 sale, referred to as the “hold harmless” proposal. Company representatives signaled in a hearing last week they intend to file an alternative plan by early next year, which Gerwatowski saw as fortuitous timing given what he expects will be a “sizeable” rise in gas and electric bills next year. 
That’s because Rhode Island Energy can finally request an increase in the amount of money it collects from customers to support its distribution costs and services following a three-year moratorium. PPL agreed not to ask for a rate base increase until 2026 as a condition of the acquisition in 2022. This is separate from usage rates, which are determined directly by prices set by third-party suppliers.
The company is expected to submit its proposal to increase revenues by the end of the year. New rates, if approved, would take effect in September 2026 – the first time since 2019, when the utilities were under National Grid’s ownership. 
“I am very worried about the rise of electric and gas rates,” Gerwatoski said. “A renewed, revised hold harmless proposal would prove a valuable tool in the regulatory toolbox as we look to avoid or lower the impact of rising electric and gas rates in the fall of 2026.”










The combination of the credits and rate reductions are intended to align with Gov. McKee’s laser-focused effort to encourage rate relief for Rhode Islanders for this winter. 


– Ronald Gerwatoski, chairman of the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission


Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, confirmed that the company will submit its rate review proposal “in the near future,” but declined to provide specifics.
“We are committed to providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to our Rhode Island customers,” Dalo said in an emailed response on Monday.
McKee also pledged to make lower utility costs part of his fiscal 2027 budget proposal, which will be unveiled in January.
In the meantime, alternative discounts will more than offset the seasonal spike in winter electricity prices, which rose 16% as of Oct. 1. Jennifer Wood, executive director at the Rhode Island Center for Justice, stressed the need for immediate relief for low-income families reeling from temporary suspension of federal food assistance and other social safety nets during the government shutdown.
“Funding one-time bill credits from existing sources in the winter of 2025-26 to mitigate the exceptional harm being experienced by the most vulnerable Rhode Islanders in the aftermath of the longest government shutdown in the nation’s history is an appropriate exercise of the PUC’s police power to protect the public good,” Wood wrote in a Nov. 17 letter to utility regulators.”
Authority in question
The Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, the administrative arm to the politically appointed commission, did not agree. The division argued the commission lacked the legal authority to dip into funds meant to support energy efficiency programs and storm preparedness and recovery.
“It seems clear that the Commission may certainly review the Company’s administration and implementation of the energy efficiency program and its funding,” Margaret Hogan, an attorney for the Division, wrote in a Nov. 17 filing. “However, no statute authorizes the Commission to reach in and access the funds for residential electric bill credits.”
Hogan noted that depleting the funds, and simultaneously suspending the customer charges that fund the programs for the first three months of 2026, will not save ratepayers in the long term because the charges will need to be increased later on to make up for the lost money. She also referred to the environmental consequences of draining funds meant to help with home weatherization, energy efficiency upgrades and other measures necessary to meet Rhode Island’s decarbonization mandates. 
A spokesperson for the Division did not immediately return requests for comment on Monday.
Similar criticisms followed in Massachusetts earlier this year after the Commonwealth’s utility regulators forced natural gas companies to temporarily suspend delivery feeds for energy efficiency programs and capital infrastructure improvements to lower customers’ bills.
Gerwatowski did not address potential environmental consequences Monday, but rebuffed questions over the commission’s authority. Rhode Island Energy has not challenged the panel’s power to tap into its funding, instead signaling support for the plan. 
“No credit is perfect but I think the approach you described is in a long line of commission decisions that prioritize customer relief,” Commissioner Abigail Anthony said Monday.
The commission recently approved a separate proposal that offered $64 million in refunds to Rhode Island Energy natural gas customers starting Nov. 1.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A Rhode Island federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling four congressionally-created agencies that fund cultural institutions, aid minority-owned businesses, mediate labor disputes, and fight homelessness.
In a permanent injunction issued Friday, Rhode Island U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. wrote that President Donald Trump exceeded his constitutional authority when trying to lay off nearly all of the workers from those agencies.
“By now, the question presented in this case is a familiar one: May the executive branch undertake such actions in circumvention of the will of the legislative branch?” McConnell, an Obama appointee, wrote. “In recent months, this court — along with other courts across the country — has concluded that it may not. That answer remains the same here.”
Trump in March issued an executive order calling for the elimination “to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law,” of seven government entities. That included four mandated by Congress: the Institute of Museum and Library Services, Minority Business Development Agency, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services, and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha along with Democratic attorneys general from 21 other states sued the administration in April arguing that the order violated the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act by attempting to override Congress.
The two other lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Attorney General Letitia James of New York and Attorney General Anne Lopez of Hawaii. Joining the lawsuit were attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
Neronha on Friday celebrated McConnell’s final ruling.
“In courts across the country and here in Rhode Island, we continue to find that we are right on the law and right on the principle,” he said in a statement. “Each of these agencies serve a vital role that the president cannot simply erase with the stroke of a pen.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai Monday said in an emailed statement to Rhode Island Current that the Trump administration “will continue using the full powers of the executive branch to prevent government waste” and that officials look forward to “ultimate victory” in court on the matter. But Desai did not say the administration would appeal the ruling.
“The president has a duty to ensure that American tax dollars are not being wasted or spent on illegal or unconstitutional programs,” Desai said.
It’s the same argument attorneys for the administration had tried to make in Providence court, stating in filings there was no particular statute limiting an agency’s discretion to make independent staffing decisions.
McConnell contended that the decision to eliminate agency programs, terminate grants, and implement large-scale staff reductions undermined their ability to perform functions as mandated by Congress.
“This is clearly not an action committed to agency discretion by law, and many courts have reached the same conclusion in similar cases,” he wrote.
Federal attorneys also tried to make the case that plaintiff states had failed to demonstrate any irreparable harm they would face should the court fail to intervene. At most, the Trump administration argued that state issues amounted to contract disputes .
McConnell pointed to the evidence submitted by the 21 states as proof that the dismantling of agency duties will have a significant impact.
New Mexico, New Jersey, Maine, and Oregon said in court documents that their public libraries would have to close branches, implement hiring freezes, and stop providing services that aim to foster literacy and support learning if the Institute of Museum and Library Service was dismantled.
Rhode Island’s Office of Library and Information Services received nearly $1.5 million from the institute in 2024 — funding that supported 50 percent of its staff, according to an April statement from Neronha’s office.
Without funding from the Minority Business Development Agency, plaintiffs had argued state universities in Hawaii, Maryland and Arizona would have to eliminate their student programming, default on contracts, and fire many of their employees.
Michigan, New York and Wisconsin all claimed their research into helping unhoused communities would come to a halt without assistance from the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.
Without federal meditators, McConnell wrote that Rhode Island, Illinois and Minnesota face the very real prospect of strikes and negotiation impasses should they be unable to tap into Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services.
At the time the lawsuit was filed, Neronha’s office noted the Rhode Island Department of Children Youth and Families avoided a strike from one of its unions because of federal mediation.
“All this to say: The injuries alleged are to the states themselves and are far more than merely economic or speculative,” McConnell wrote.

(Photo by BetterPhoto/iStock/Getty Images)While the text of the Iowa Constitution lacks the prominence of that adopted by our nation’s Founding Fathers, people from Ackley to Zwingle and points in between should track down a copy and give it a read.
Buried away in the document adopted by Iowa voters in 1857, they will find Article III, Section 31, or what has come to be known as the public purpose requirement. That section says, in essence, that state and local governments are barred from spending public money unless there is a public purpose for those expenditures.
My public-school education tells me that section prohibits the use of taxpayer money to continue to pay someone for work after their performance ends unless the government entity provides justification of the public purpose served by those payments.
Where I come from, going-away gifts do not serve a public purpose. And this brings me to the Des Moines Public Schools and last week’s news headlines.
On Nov. 18, the school board convened a closed session. The purpose, its agenda stated, was “to evaluate the professional competency of an individual whose appointment, hiring, performance or discharge is being considered when necessary to prevent needless and irreparable injury to that person’s reputation.”
At the conclusion of that private discussion, the board voted to accept the already-tendered resignation of Robert Lundin, the district’s chief academic officer, effective June 30, 2026.
Lundin was a “strategic consultant” before joining the Des Moines schools in May 2024. For reasons it never been made public, the district placed him on paid administrative leave last Oct. 6. He has not worked since then.
As part of a “separation agreement” that was made public the day after the board “evaluated” Lundin and accepted his resignation last week, the public learned his paid administrative leave will continue until the school year ends next June 30.
For those keeping track of dollars and cents, Lundin pocketed six weeks’ salary while on administrative leave and now will continue to collect a salary at an annual rate of $195,658 for seven more months.
So, between now and June 30, the district will give Lundin approximately $114,200 to do work that ended Oct. 6. That is roughly equivalent to what two Des Moines teachers are paid for working the entire school year.
The school board has given no explanation why it will pay this money to an administrator who will have only worked about three months of his 12-month contract — or how he has earned that compensation for days he will not work or provide services to the Des Moines Public Schools.
The board offered no explanation of its rationale — or of the supposed public purpose for that expenditure.
Phil Roeder, the director of communications and public affairs for the DMPS, said in an email to me, “This separation was a mutual decision and not based on any discipline or misconduct by Dr. Lundin.”
OK. But if a $50,000-a-year teacher asks to be released from a contract in the middle of the school year, the district will not pay the teacher through the end of the school year the way Lundin will get paid. Instead, the district’s master contract and policy manual warn teachers the district will assess those who resign early a $1,500 fee for breaking their contracts.
This is not the first time the school board has embarrassed itself with a lack of transparency and candor with taxpayers. In 2022, when Tom Ahart resigned as Des Moines superintendent with one year left on his contract, the board entered into a similar separation agreement. In that instance, the Ahart agreement cost the taxpayers nearly $400,000 in compensation for the year he did not work.
Beyond the public-purpose requirement of the Iowa Constitution, a few other factors in Lundin’s departure should concern Iowans.
State law requires government employers to make public what are called “the documented reasons and rationale” for the demotion of a government employee, for the person’s termination or for the employee’s resignation in lieu of termination.
If Lundin’s resignation truly was voluntary, as DMPS leaders claim, then why give him a lucrative goodbye present?
Why did the school board need to meet in closed session to discuss his job performance, since his resignation was dated four days prior to the board meeting? No reasonable employer evaluates the performance of an employee who has quit.
Was the board going to refuse to accept his resignation — even though the separation agreement had already been written and signed by Lundin?
And if his departure was not his decision alone, then where are the “documented reasons and rationale” that lawmakers said must be made public when a “resign or else” directive is given?
Without facts and openness, only the school board members and Robert Lundin know what led to his administrative leave and then his resignation. Only the board knows whether it was as cavalier as it looks to fork over a $114,000 gift from taxpayers as he departed.
Almost 50 years ago, W. Ward Reynoldson, Osceola’s folksy Supreme Court justice, wrote about a “plain judicial intent to permit the concept of ‘public purpose’ to have that flexibility and expansive scope required to meet the challenges of increasingly complex social, economic, and technological conditions.”
But in tough economic times and tight budgets for public schools, it hardly seems possible that complex conditions support stretching the term “public purpose” to encompass parting gifts paid to highly compensated public employees, especially when they are allowed to ride quietly into the sunset without completing the work they were hired to do.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)When Charlotte’s City Council met last Monday, members confronted a reality shared by cities and counties across North Carolina: immigrant communities shaken by recent federal immigration raids, and local governments with little room to respond.
The meeting came as federal agents carried out operations in several parts of the state, including Durham and Raleigh. The arrests prompted parents to keep children home from school, workers to miss shifts and families to avoid public spaces.
As council members described fear rippling through neighborhoods, they also acknowledged the limits of their authority.
“The city of Charlotte only has as much power as is explicitly granted or inherently granted by the General Assembly’s general statutes,” City Attorney Andrea Leslie-Fite told members. “So when it comes to things of this magnitude, or anything else for that matter, we first have to look to the authority that’s been granted … and the limitations.”
Those limits stem from North Carolina’s strict interpretation of Dillion’s Rule, which gives cities only the powers the legislature explicitly approves. Unlike “home-rule” states, where municipalities have broad authority to pass local ordinances without seeking state approval, North Carolina municipalities cannot set their own immigration policies, restrict cooperation with federal agents or adopt “sanctuary” ordinances.
“It’s like two different types of parenting,” said Rick Su, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who studies the intersection of cities and immigration. “One is like, you do whatever you want, but when you do something wrong, then I’m going to punish you. The other is like, don’t do anything, and ask me for permission before you do anything.”
Lawmakers in Raleigh have repeatedly moved to shape immigration policies in the state, passing bans on sanctuary policies and backing measures that would require sheriffs to cooperate with federal authorities. As a result, cities from Raleigh and Durham to Greensboro and Winston-Salem operate under the same constraints as Charlotte, regardless of local political consensus.
Even so, Charlotte officials outlined several steps they believe fall within their authority. The city will require judicial warrants for federal agents seeking access to nonpublic city facilities. Other measures include protecting confidential data where possible and scrutinizing public-record requests. Officials also debated direct funding for community organizations assisting immigrant families.
On the policing side, the city’s police officers will not participate in immigration arrests but can verify the identities of federal agents, respond to reports of possible immigration activity and investigate any criminal behavior.
Still, immigrant advocates say municipalities could do more. “There’s so much creativity and wisdom in local government,” Andrew Willis Garces, a senior strategist with Siembra N.C., told NC Newsline.
“If officials got in rooms across jurisdictions and asked, ‘What would it take to make this state the safest for immigrants in the South?’ they could make a list of things to do now,” Garces told NC Newsline in an interview.
Garces said municipalities could hold public hearings on how federal actions are affecting communities, direct city managers to produce reports on what they learn, and adopt local resolutions protecting workplace rights and Fourth Amendment guarantees. He noted that Durham, Chapel Hill and Greensboro have already committed to the “Stand Up for Greensboro, Chapel Hill, Durham” resolution.
Su agreed. He said that while the state’s framework is narrow, many cities interpret it even more restrictively than the law requires. Municipalities, he said, often underestimate the authority they do have.
“I think sometimes city attorneys and politicians in North Carolina imagine themselves as having even less power than they do,” he said. Cities still possess regulatory tools they routinely use in other contexts — and those tools can apply to federal agencies as well.
For example, Su said North Carolina cities can use zoning and safety reviews for buildings used by federal authorities, audits of contracts or land-use agreements for shared facilities, and standard identification requirements for anyone operating in nonpublic, city-controlled spaces. These are not immigration policies, he said, but ordinary exercises of municipal authority that apply to everyone.
“These are not about obstructing immigration enforcement,” he said. “They’re about cities exercising the powers they already have — zoning, property control and general regulatory authority — which they use in every other context.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4603-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 14:58:05.956999

(Getty Images)New Mexico legislators on Friday expressed concerns that judicial rulings in a longstanding education equity case might interfere with local and statewide decision making.  
The 10-year-old Yazzie/Martinez lawsuit established that the state education department had not been providing equitable educational opportunities to at-risk students, identified as Native American students, English Language Learners, students with disabilities and students from low-income households. Earlier this year, the parties returned to court because the plaintiffs remained unsatisfied with the state’s progress. First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson agreed with the plaintiffs and ordered the state to complete a remedial action plan.
The state submitted the first draft of that plan to the court on Oct. 1, but stakeholders quickly rejected it as too “vague.” The Public Education Department then had another month to make revisions before submitting the final draft on Nov. 3.
On Friday, Legislative Finance and Education Study Committee members met during a joint meeting at the Roundhouse to hear the latest update on the plan.
PED Secretary Mariana Padilla outlined the four critical needs identified in the plan, including equitable access to “high-quality instruction;” high-quality teachers who are culturally and linguistically responsive; services relating to academics, social well-being and behavioral needs; and “effective” funding and accountability. 
“The plan has changed dramatically,” Padilla said, noting that much of the feedback the department received asked for more detail. “People wanted to know what we meant by each action. Give us the details of what this entails. They wanted to know who was responsible for implementing it; how we were going to actually operationalize that action item; and then how are we going to track that for outcomes.”
Padilla said other revisions involved expanded support for English language learners, alignment with the “tribal remedy framework” for meeting Native American students’ needs, expansions to out-of-school time and clearer accountability measures.
Padilla’s presentation also highlighted several proposed legislative actions for next year’s January session, including requiring structured literacy and numeracy in elementary schools; creating a permanent Office of Special Education; and amending the state’s laws around attendance to ensure suspension and expulsion practices are not disproportionately directed at at-risk students.

“These pieces of legislation will help us to improve our educator preparation efforts, they will help us really target our efforts in math and literacy. [They] will also help us improve our supports for our students with disabilities, as well as address [the] Attendance for Success Act,” Padilla said. 
The department also is seeking increased compensation for personnel and a larger overall budget.
“We are really utilizing funding that the Legislature has already provided to us and we have a lot of that base funding that we need in the public school support request, however there will be some additional needs,” Padilla said.
Padilla also noted actions the PED is currently taking toward implementing the remedial action plan, such as developing “linguistically and culturally relevant” assessment measures and ensuring Native American representation for special education advisory panels.
Sen. Bill Soules (D-Las Cruces), a former educator, said the original court finding in the Yazzie/Martinez case was primarily based on low literacy and math scores of at-risk students. He said the state has made strides in addressing those two areas and funding supports, but questioned what the goal of the case is now, whether the court’s initial concerns were addressed and how the state is measuring progress toward those ends.
“I think this whole thing comes down to ‘how do we balance Legislative control, department control and local control?’ So much of what needs to be done is at the local district and local school boards,” Soules said during the meeting. “Do we really want to balance or have the Legislature or the department micromanaging everything in a budget? And at what level does the department step in because they clearly are not meeting the goals and targets of the Martinez/Yazzie lawsuit.”
He added that the two major needs to address the court’s findings can be whittled down to funding and support. Rep. Tara Lujan (D-Santa Fe) shared similar concerns over the “autonomy” of local schools and school boards. 
“Ten years, we’re not done. We’re not done, but how long is this going to be in the court system? Our policies and what we are tasked to do, why we exist as a branch of government, is going to be allocated to the judicial system. I’m concerned with that.”
Padilla told committee members that she does not believe the judge’s intent is to have “oversight” over the department or the state for “decades,” but that these questions should be directed to the court.
The Yazzie/Martinez plaintiffs must submit their response to the final draft plan to the court by Dec. 1, then the PED has the opportunity to respond in mid-December. The court will then set a hearing date to discuss the developments.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1088179758-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 13:57:40.451625
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-24 18:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT is getting millions to expand broadband. Some locations could be left behind,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/ct-internet-expansion-bead-program/,A 2021 program was intended to expand internet access. But federal eligibility changes could exclude roughly 80% of CT’s in-need locations.,"Four years ago, when the Biden administration tasked states with creating plans to drastically expand broadband in the U.S., there was a question of what the call would mean for Connecticut, already one of most well-connected states in the country. 
Still, early federal maps identified thousands of places that needed help, suggesting there were more than 15,000 places — ranging from households in rural and geographically isolated communities, to small businesses struggling to afford better connections — in need of reliable high-speed internet. 
In the years since, the state has launched a variety of initiatives aimed at improving connections. The ConneCTed Communities Grant Program has provided some $34 million in state grants to help internet service providers build out broadband infrastructure, connecting thousands of locations. Internet providers have also worked to improve service, further reducing the number of households in need. 
The federal government’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, a $42.45 billion initiative launched in 2021 and aimed at providing additional financial support, was intended to help states move even further toward achieving the goal of “Internet for All.” Connecticut is set to receive some $144 million under the program, money intended to bring high-speed, affordable broadband to the state’s unserved and underserved areas.
[RELATED: CT to receive $144 million as part of push for high-speed internet]
After a significant delay, the state received good news last week: Connecticut is one of 18 states to receive federal approval for the final version of its BEAD plan. Connecticut won’t immediately receive the $144 million it has been awarded, but federal approval is seen as a key step in the process, indicating that the state has done enough to receive its funding in the near future. 
The announcement was quickly met with praise by state officials. 
“Access to fast, affordable, reliable high-speed internet is a requirement of life today, whether it be getting medical care, paying bills, or finding work and educational opportunities,” Governor Ned Lamont said in a statement. “Improving residents’ access to broadband has been a priority of mine since we enacted Connecticut’s first broadband bill in 2021, and this authorization marks another significant step toward that goal.”
But the conditions for the money — the BEAD program initially required multiple application rounds, assessments and administrative requirements — have changed significantly in recent months.
The Trump administration restructured the program, issuing a June policy notice that removed guidelines supporting climate change resilience, workforce diversity and broadband affordability. 
The administration instead pushed states to prioritize what it called the “benefit of the bargain” — a call to build broadband infrastructure at low costs, despite states already crafting detailed plans on how the broadband money could be used.
The administration also encouraged a “technology neutral” approach — abandoning the Biden administration’s preference for more expensive fiber connections in favor of a broader range of broadband technology, including satellite programs like Elon Musk’s Starlink and Amazon’s Leo.
Those changes — following years of challenges to federal broadband maps, internet access expansions and regulatory updates — further reduced the number of locations that still qualify for the BEAD program. By the summer of 2025, Connecticut had just 885 locations that were expected to still be served by BEAD, a more than 80% reduction from the initial numbers. 
The recent policy changes reduced that number even more. In its updated plan, the state expects to serve 717 locations, leaving some the most expensive and hardest-to-connect locations off of the list.
Now, with the BEAD money on the way, state leaders say they are prepared to use the broadband money as soon as possible.
“We are ready to expand critical infrastructure across the state that will empower our workforce, drive economic development, support healthcare, and advance education,” Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes said in a statement. “We look forward to seeing every corner of the state benefit from this program as Connecticut closes the gap on internet access.” 
But the federal broadband program is about to launch in a national landscape that is very different from when it was first enacted. And as efforts to close the digital divide shift, changes to the once lauded initiative may render it less effective. 
A shift in federal priorities 
From the beginning, the BEAD program set out with an ambitious goal: connecting as many people as possible to the internet.
In the past few years, states put together plans outlining how they would accomplish the task. Connecticut first released drafts of its two part broadband plan in 2023 and received federal approval for its initial proposal early in 2024. 
The plan was detailed, calling for the state to promote affordability, expand broadband services and provide support to ensure that people didn’t just have internet access, they also knew how to use the internet and could navigate digital tools. 
The federal funds were a crucial part of that effort. “BEAD is an infrastructure program,” said Reid Sharkey, a community broadband specialist and researcher with the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, a national organization that supports expanded internet access. “The first goal is getting broadband service to all of the locations that need it in the country. But then beyond that, the remaining funds are used for sort of maximizing the potential of those networks.”
But the BEAD program has dragged in its rollout. More than three years after it was first announced, the vast majority of the money allotted under BEAD has gone unspent, frustrating broadband advocates and digital policy experts. 
The delays in the BEAD program are a key reason why the Trump administration argued that it needed to restructure the initiative. But the new changes to the program are complicated and have raised their own concerns in recent months. 
The administration says it is squarely focused on one thing: cost. During the summer, the federal government pivoted to telling states to focus on building broadband for less money, drastically reducing the spending expected under the program. One analysis, completed last month by experts at New York Law School’s Advanced Communications Law and Policy Institute, suggests that states are on track to spend around just half—roughly $21 billion — of the available BEAD funds. 
A separate analysis from the institute found that as many as one million locations may still lack high-speed internet after the BEAD program completes distributing funds. The organization has suggested that the leftover money could be used to fund an additional round of BEAD to help close any gaps. 
But that solution isn’t currently being backed by the federal government. The administration has instead suggested that it may pull any remaining “non-deployment” funds back from the states, framing the reduced state BEAD spending as “savings” in recent discussions of the program. 
“With so much money left over, some people have argued why not spend a little bit more, give them fiber or cable or terrestrial network and not have to give them satellite service,” said Michael Santorelli, the director of the Advanced Communications Law and Policy Institute. “Under the Trump rules, that’s not how it works.”

Connecticut’s plan will expand broadband, but some communities will be left out
For the most part, Connecticut managed to avoid needing to overhaul its BEAD plan. The state still intends to primarily install fiber connections, which are more expensive than satellite-delivered internet, but are generally seen as having better longevity. And the state has used its own money to help establish additional broadband connections in recent years. 
But the BEAD changes will affect how Connecticut works to reach more expensive and geographically-isolated areas. In its final broadband plan submitted earlier in the fall, officials noted that the new cost requirements made fiber a financial non-starter in some areas, adding that it was difficult to find an affordable satellite provider that could fill the gap. As a result, some 119 unserved locations, and an additional 49 underserved locations, cannot be helped with BEAD. 
In both cases, the state argued that the costs of connecting these areas would be “unreasonably excessive. ” 
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, the agency tasked with overseeing the BEAD application process, acknowledged in an email to the Connecticut Mirror that the new federal guidance affected the state’s plan to connect these areas. 
But the agency maintained that the funds will still have a significant impact on communities in the state. 
“We intended to finish the job of connecting everyone to the degree possible with BEAD, and are doing so, connecting another 717 program-eligible residential and small business locations in 76 towns throughout the state,” said agency spokesman Will Healey. 
“Ultimately, even with the Restructuring Policy Notice, Connecticut has been successful in meeting our key goals for the deployment phase of the program,” he added. 
The BEAD program is just one way that the federal government has altered Biden-era broadband initiatives in recent months. Earlier this year, the administration terminated funding that was going to be allotted under the Digital Equity Act, a $2.75 billion proposal that would help states fund efforts to improve digital literacy and related skills in vulnerable communities. 
The changes cost Connecticut $20 million, a loss that has frustrated advocates who hoped the money would support workforce development, digital navigation and community education efforts around the country. 
“People are still getting scammed every day. People are still not able to apply for jobs, people are still not able to talk to their doctors. All of those things are still happening,” Angela Siefer, the executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, told the Connecticut Mirror in June. “What’s changed is that we don’t have this federal investment that would allow us to figure out what works.” 
Months later, those concerns remain. “A lot of the folks that are going to get service through BEAD have never had access at their home to the Internet,” said Sharkey. “The Digital Equity Act was going to ensure that those folks had an opportunity to really maximize the impact that broadband access could have on their lives.” 
And those changes mean that even as the digital divide narrows across the country, broadband advocates and policy experts say that more work will need to be done to ensure that people are able to take advantage of internet access and devices. 
The exact impact of Connecticut’s BEAD investments will not be clear until the remaining locations are connected. But for now, state officials say they remain optimistic about the state’s work and what comes next. 
“We’ve also prioritized getting the best technology, long-term scalable broadband connections for residents as possible so that the infrastructure investment lasts well into the future,” Healey, the DEEP spokesperson, said in an emailed statement. “ We’ve been able to achieve that end.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP21223106132981-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 13:57:40.451625

(Photo courtesy of the Indiana Public Retirement System)More than 6,000 members of the Indiana Public Retirement System have collectively left behind millions of dollars in benefits — but a new database aims to connect them to their cash.
It’s the centerpiece of INPRS’ “reclaim your retirement” campaign.
“The creation of this database was driven by our commitment to protecting the financial well-being of our members,” spokeswoman Carolina Rodríguez told the Capital Chronicle.
As of October, about 3,700 INPRS members were eligible to request their earned retirement benefits, with median monthly payments ranging from $545.50 to $783.50. They may also have defined contribution accounts waiting, with balances averaging $14,451 to $33,342, according to INPRS.
Nearly 2,400 other retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries had funds issued to them but the money went unused, according to a news release.

“We have identified that many individuals have earned retirement benefits but were unaware they had funds available or had lost contact due to changes in address, employment, or personal circumstances,” Rodríguez said. “In some situations, benefit checks were delivered as intended but never deposited into the recipient’s account.”
The information is hosted securely in a database outside of INPRS member accounts. Visitors must enter a first name, last name, and date of birth.
“Everyone is invited” to search the database, the news release says. “… for themselves, friends, family members, former colleagues, and the like for a match. When a search for someone other than yourself is successful, let that person know right away.”
If there is a match in the database, instructions will pop up for what to do next. If there’s not a match, INPRS’ website offers, “you may still have a retirement benefit with us but you’re just not on our list for this initiative.”
Hoosiers can call the agency at 844-464-6777, 8 a.m.-8 p.m., and should be ready to authenticate their identities.
INPRS manages about $50 billion in assets on behalf of more than 540,000 current and former public employees.

(Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/Arizona Mirror)The governors of multiple Western states touted their willingness to work across the aisle as they met with members of the Trump administration in a wealthy Phoenix suburb Thursday to discuss issues ranging from powering data centers to Congress’s farm bill.
“We work together in service of the region and the nation as a whole,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters Thursday morning at a press conference prior to the start of the Western Governors’ Association’s winter meeting at the Omni Scottsdale Resort and Spa in Paradise Valley. “Working together actually still works.”

Cox was joined by Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green and Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, all of whom touted the “bipartisan” nature of the WGA gathering, which featured Trump cabinet officials Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Doug Burgum, who heads up the Interior Department.
The WGA’s winter meeting also featured three panel sessions dedicated to issues impacting Western states: data center energy demands, the upcoming reauthorization of the farm bill and the growing need for broadband internet in rural areas.
The meeting comes as many of the Western states present have failed to meet a deadline on an agreement on how to share Colorado River water.
“We know that we all are going to have to work together and make sacrifices,” Cox said when asked by reporters about the recent water woes, adding that the states are “working closely together” to avoid federal intervention. Hobbs, who has been sharply critical of Upper Basin states like Colorado and Utah for refusing to accept cuts in their water supply, noted that she had a meeting scheduled with Burgum to discuss the negotiations.
 Western governors talk federal budget cuts

That facetime with Trump administration officials was something all the governors touted as a major positive for the gathering Thursday, adding that it allowed them the ability to voice their concerns about a number of issues facing their states.
That includes the impending cuts to Medicaid that will cut health care spending for the state-managed programs by $1 trillion over the next decade and kick an estimated 12 million people off their health insurance.
Policymakers plan for ‘energy superabundance’ at Western governors conference

Cox and Gianforte, both Republicans, said they feel they’ll be able to “absorb those cuts” when they hit their states.
Green and Hobbs, both Democrats, were less optimistic. Green said Hawaii will look at using its rainy day fund to supplement money lost from the cuts, while Hobbs said her administration is looking into how Arizona will mitigate the impacts of the federal cuts when the state legislature begins crafting a budget in January.
But the state doesn’t have the money to replace what the Trump administration is taking away, she said.
“We cannot backfill the cuts,” Hobbs stressed to reporters.
 Officials face policy changes to agriculture, water managment and data centers

One issue of particular importance to Western states is the proliferation of data centers used to drive the artificial intelligence industry, and the unprecedented energy demands that have come with them.
With the AI boom, there has been an explosion in the number of data centers — facilities that can be hundreds of thousands of square-feet large and are filled with computer servers — that run and operate the AI systems. They require a large amount of power and are straining energy providers, resulting in higher rates for residents in many cases.
“We’re trying to do more faster,” Cully Cavness, president and COO of Crusoe Energy, an AI data center startup that recently raised $1.3 billion, told the governors.
To Cavness and others on a panel discussing data center expansion, local permitting is the primary reason more data centers haven’t already been built. The panelists, which included businesses with billions invested in AI and data centers, all agreed that speeding up the permitting process for data centers is key to creating more.
Cox and others see building out more data centers as integral into an “AI arms race” with China, an argument that Burgum echoed later during his keynote speech.
 Congress is still debating new farm bill in D.C.

While technology took up a majority of the conversations Thursday, panelists also discussed with governors another pressing issue: food.
“It seems like the support is there, but it is being piecemealed, and it can’t be piecemealed,” Geri Byrne, a supervisor in California’s Modoc County and chair of the Rural County Representatives of California, said about the ongoing congressional debate around the farm bill.
The farm bill, a package of legislation that is passed every five years, governs the ways agriculture and farming is done in the United States. The current bill expires in September 2026.
Byrne said she is worried that partisan gridlock in Congress means the favored strategy has been to “piecemeal” parts of the legislation to win approval on easier components of the policy package. But that means negotiators will have a difficult time getting the support needed to get a “clean” version of the bill next year.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

“I’m sorry to get political,” said Stanley Dick, a commissioner from Cavalier County in North Dakota, voicing a concern that the Trump administration will not agree to a five-year version of the bill because it likes “short-term things.”
“Things change politically real quick right now,” he said, adding that a “skinny bill” is something he has been hearing about that has been resonating more than a long-term fix with people in Washington, D.C.
And while Dick, a farmer himself, said he found the discussions around data centers fascinating, he was more concerned about trends among farming. Half of the farmers in the United States are over the age of retirement and the cost of entry into the field is often high.
“I mean, how long can we go without food?” Dick asked the attendees.
 Secretaries Burgum, Kennedy provide keynote at Western Governors Association meeting

The day’s work ended with a pair of keynote speeches from Burgum and Kennedy.
Burgum told the governors about the administration’s plans for “energy dominance,” which has included moving away from renewable energy and moving back towards fossil fuels. During his time at the Interior, Burgum has helped fast-track fossil fuel extraction on public lands, uranium mining permits and looked to speed up permitting for nuclear power.
U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum testifies before a House Appropriations subcommittee on May 20, 2025. (Screenshot from committee webcast)
“It is innovation, not regulation, that has led to American greatness,” he said.
Burgum defended the administration’s decisions as being imperative to keep pace with China, claiming that if environmentalist groups are worried about pollution, then they should be wanting the United States to be engaged in drilling for oil and mining and not other countries.
“We should be insisting this all be happening here,” Burgum said.
Burgum also decried environmental groups who he claimed use the Endangered Species Act to delay and stop projects simply to “raise money.” He also claimed that environmental assessments, which are required to ensure projects do not impact sites, take too long so his office has been using AI to speed up the process.
While Burgum drew a considerable crowd, it was Kennedy who brought the most people into the ballroom.
Kennedy, who repeated a number of false claims during his keynote speech, received pushback from Green, who was a family physician before becoming governor.
“If (people) see us fighting, the doubt itself can be harmful,” Green said during a back-and-forth between the two men about vaccines.
Kennedy has been an outspoken crusader against vaccines, and Green had asked how he could ensure that the agency he oversees does not create undue harm or panic with the messages they are putting out in regards to vaccines. (The day before the WGA meeting, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which Kennedy oversees, changed its website to say there is a link between vaccines and autism. Such connections have been pushed by Kennedy and other anti-vaccine activists, but have been long debunked by a large body of high-quality scientific research.)

Earlier this year, multiple states began issuing standing orders for the COVID-19 vaccine amid moves by HHS to make the vaccine only available via a prescription to certain individuals.
“I’m not trying to take away anyone’s vaccines,” Kennedy said to Green. “What I want is to make sure vaccines are properly tested.”
Vaccines, especially childhood vaccines, undergo rigorous scientific testing. They are safe and have virtually eliminated many childhood illnesses that left children disabled or dead.
Both Green and Kennedy, though, could agree that having the government be open and honest to the best of their abilities is something to aim for. They also agreed that Washington D.C. is dysfunctional.
“I am pessimistic about finding common ground on Capitol Hill,” Kennedy said. “No one is even talking to each other.”

While there is no single solution to our many transportation challenges, the growing popularity of Bluebikes is showing that the region’s public bikeshare program can play an important role.   The Boston Globe recently reported that annual Bluebikes ridership jumped from 2.1 million trips in 2020 to 4.7 million trips in 2024, with the spike attributed to an increase in docking stations, new discount programs, and the addition of electric bicycles—or e-bikes—in early 2024. E-bikes are equipped with a small, battery-powered electric motor that helps riders reach speeds of up to 18 miles per hour when pedaling, effectively shortening distances and flattening terrain.  Bluebikes aren’t just riding a wave of popularity—they are redefining how Greater Boston moves. A recent A Better City report comparing Bluebikes ridership between 2023 and 2024 found that e-bikes powered 25 percent of all rides in 2024. With roughly 700 e-bikes in the system, compared to the more than 4,000 classic bikes, each individual e-bike made almost twice as many trips on average as each classic bike. Even though e-bikes are slightly more expensive—there is a per-minute fee levied on each e-bike ride—many riders are opting for e-bikes when available.   The Bluebikes system is collectively owned and operated by 13 municipalities—Arlington, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Newton, Revere, Salem, Somerville, and Watertown. Thanks to the stewardship of sponsor Blue Cross Blue Shield, the coordination of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, and local, state, and federal investments marshaled by the participating municipalities, the Bluebikes system is expanding. 
Regional planning is underway to double the system by 2030, and the City of Boston is in the middle of a 100-station expansion. A Better City’s full report includes more detailed recommendations for improving the reliability and capacity of the system, such as expanding the e-bike fleet, integrating charging infrastructure into bike docks, and prioritizing co-location with transit and filling gaps in the network when siting new stations.    Importantly, it’s not just the Bluebikes network that is growing—our regional bike infrastructure is growing too. Safe, separated infrastructure—like the Somerville Community Path, Northern Strand, and Neponset River Greenway—are drawing more commuters and recreational users alike. To help manage this growth, A Better City, with support from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, launched the Guided Ride Series last April to provide riders with the knowledge and confidence to navigate this new urban bike infrastructure. We teach best riding practices, rules of the road, safety tips and tricks, and publish routes accessible for free via smartphone. As our bike infrastructure continues to evolve, so must our education campaigns.   Greater Boston has what most major metros do not: a comprehensive public transit network that is increasingly integrated with our Bluebikes system. The connectivity between the two has the potential to provide tremendous flexibility in how people can get around. More than 70 percent of the MBTA’s rapid transit stops, including the Blue, Red, Orange, Green, and Silver lines, have at least one Bluebikes docking station within 200 meters. With this overlap, a Bluebikes ride can cover the first or last mile of a multimodal commute to extend the range of MBTA trips, save time on trips via transit, and make traveling without a car convenient where it otherwise wouldn’t be feasible.   What does all this mean for the future of transportation in Greater Boston? The expansion of the Bluebikes network (powered by e-bikes), and bike infrastructure demonstrates the massive potential for people to shift some of their short trips away from cars, alleviating our worst-in-the-nation traffic and reducing vehicle carbon emissions. The MassDOT Statewide Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan estimates that 57 percent of trips taken across all modes in Massachusetts are three miles or less. That’s a 12-minute bike ride, on average, if you’re riding a Bluebikes e-bike.   
For those who haven’t ridden a Bluebike yet, there are mutiple ways to give an e-bike a try. Casual riders can unlock a single ride for $2.95 plus $0.25 per minute, or purchase a day of unlocks for $10 plus $0.25 per minute. Membership options offer free unlocks and a reduced per minute rate of $0.10 for monthly and annual options, and $0.07 for income eligible riders. For employers who want to offer this type of mobility to their workers, there are several levels of subsidy available, all of which include free unlocks and discounted per minute rates on e-bikes. A Better City built a Bluebikes Calculator to demonstrate the low-cost, high-impact nature of such a benefit, which is less than 28 cents per day for an annual membership.  
With e-bikes supercharging the Bluebikes system, they are demonstrating how bikeshare can be part of the solution to address our traffic crisis and to achieve our climate goals.

But the letter doesn’t specify what “comprehensive oversight” means. And it’s not clear that the people who signed the letter agree on the meaning either.
A total of 22 Republican state legislators from both the Senate and the House signed on to the letter, including Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, Sen. Ruth Johnson — a former Michigan secretary of state — and Rep. Rachelle Smit, who leads the House Election Integrity Committee.
The letter asks the U.S. Justice Department to “deploy official election monitors and provide comprehensive oversight for Michigan’s 2026 primary and general elections.” It cites a number of concerns about Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s administration of the election, from the fact that she is running for governor in the 2026 election to her alleged violations of election law.
It is not unusual for secretaries of state to oversee elections they are candidates in. Benson ran the 2022 election that won her a second term, for instance, and Johnson oversaw two separate elections as secretary in which she was also on the ballot. In Michigan, while the secretary of state sets rules and regulations, it is local clerks who typically work with voters more directly, creating a layer of separation between the state’s highest election official and the voters who may or may not be supporting them.
It’s not clear if the Justice Department will take the matter on, but Johnson told Votebeat on Thursday that department officials were already meeting on the request. She said she didn’t know who specifically was involved, and a spokesperson for the department did not respond to a request for comment.
 Nebulous views of ‘oversight’

The first part of the Republicans’ request — federal election monitors — isn’t unusual. Monitors watch polling places and vote-counting centers to ensure workers are following processes appropriately. Under President Joe Biden, the Justice Department sent monitors to 27 states in the 2024 general election, including Michigan, and sent monitors for Michigan’s primary election as well. Under President Donald Trump, it sent monitors to California and New Jersey earlier this month after similar requests from members of the GOP in both states, but those monitors were uninvasive and may not have visited certain jurisdictions at all.
“Comprehensive oversight,” though, is a more abstract idea.
To Johnson, oversight in 2026 would be “something that has to be worked out, because you always have to balance everything.” In an interview with Votebeat, she did not go into specifics about what type of intervention she might welcome in Michigan, although she offered one example of something she hopes federal involvement could accomplish: ensuring people don’t vote twice.
That’s already rare in Michigan. Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, pursued charges against several people in an investigation of double voting last year. Charges were dropped against most, while one was sentenced to probation this year.
But a 2022 statewide audit found that, out of more than 11.7 million votes cast from May 2019 to March 2021, 99.99% were not duplicate votes.
Nesbitt didn’t offer much detail about what federal oversight could look like, either.
“We aren’t leaving any options off the table,” he said in an emailed statement. “The level of federal intervention in Michigan’s election is going to depend entirely on Jocelyn Benson’s willingness to cooperate with the DOJ and follow the law. I’m confident the DOJ will do whatever is necessary to ensure our next election is free of any manipulation.”
Nesbitt said that Benson “should welcome DOJ oversight” if elections are as secure as she claims. Johnson, meanwhile, said she would primarily like to see oversight from someone independent.
Johnson argued that circumstances are different from when she was secretary of state and administering elections in 2014 and 2018. “I was nonpartisan in every single way,” she said. “I got in trouble with some people in my own party because of it.” Benson, she said, has not been the same.
The Michigan Department of State argues that isn’t true. Elections in Michigan “are among the most transparent, secure and accessible in the nation,” Angela Benander, a spokesperson for MDOS, said after the letter was released last week.
“Next year’s election will be no different,” Benander continued. “Yet by pouring gasoline on our democracy and asking the DOJ to light a match, these lawmakers ignore these truths. They instead use dangerous, false rhetoric to encourage President Trump to illegally interfere in our state’s ability to hold fair and free elections.”
 Federal intervention has few precedents

Experts say the federal government’s ability to intervene in elections is limited. The Constitution is very clear, for example, that states get to establish “the times, places and manner” of elections.
Historically, when the federal government has gotten involved in elections, it has usually been through legislation. During Reconstruction, for instance, Congress passed a series of Enforcement Acts that made it a federal crime to interfere with elections. However, that was at a time when Ku Klux Klan members were using violence to prevent Black voters from casting ballots — a radically different circumstance than the ongoing lawsuits and alleged conflicts of interest Benson faces today.
The timing of the letter is also unusual, said David Becker, an election lawyer who worked in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and now leads the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research — the general election is nearly a full year away.
“I don’t know of a single instance in all of DOJ history where a jurisdiction that wasn’t previously monitored had monitors assigned more than a few weeks before,” he said.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Accompanied by a blazing turkey and — by his own estimation — fireable dad jokes, Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia hosted a fried turkey safety demonstration Monday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.
Ingoglia, who also serves as state fire marshal, was joined by the Tallahassee Fire Department to caution Floridians against the danger of home fires on Thanksgiving and teach them the “don’ts” of frying turkeys.
“Thanksgiving is the peak day for home-cooking fires,” Ingoglia said, thanking the firefighters and noting Thanksgiving cooking is responsible for three times the daily average of home fires any other day of the year.
“Be safe this holiday season. Take heed, take caution, and make sure we don’t have any mistakes that will land you guys in the hospital room.”
Floridians should set up the turkey-frying station far away from their homes at ground-level, completely thaw the bird before frying it, never overfill the pot, keep children far away, and always have a fire extinguisher nearby, Ingoglia said.

“We have a demonstration for you,” the Spring Hill Republican added, stepping back as firefighters in heavy protective gear moved to purposely fry a turkey incorrectly.
Holding a long beam between them hoisting a hefty turkey on a string, two firefighters lowered the bird into an overfilled pot of boiling oil.
Within seconds, a massive fire erupted in and around the pot.
In his closing words, Ingoglia told three Thanksgiving-themed dad jokes written by his communications team that he claimed to have not seen before. His team bet him $100 dollars he wouldn’t read them, he added.
“I don’t know if they’re funny,” he warned.
“How can you tell if a local government politician carved a turkey? Half went to special interests and the other half went missing,” the first one read, touching on Ingoglia’s months-long mission to examine alleged overspending by local governments.
Appearing unsure, he read the next:
“What did the fried turkey say when the oil overflowed? Well that escalated crispy.”
Begrudgingly, he read another — “What’s the difference between a well-fried turkey and a badly-fried one? One’s dinner and the other is a story at Thanksgiving that your mother-in-law will tell for the next 20 years.” — before joking that he would soon have an opening in his communications team.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)In a letter sent last week, Democratic New Mexico U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) pressed United States Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins for more details about her recently announced plan to require food benefit recipients to reapply.
Rollins first mentioned the possibility that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program beneficiaries would have to reapply to the program during an interview on the right-wing Newsmax network.
The letter, signed by 30 Democratic U.S. senators, including Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, notes “serious concern” about a proposal to have people reapply to the program and says, “these changes appear to be duplicative of existing SNAP rules and designed to create more red tape for families seeking to put food on the table.”
The letter continues on to describe the disruption to SNAP that occurred during the 43-day government shutdown that ended Nov. 12. 
In New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham allocated $30 million in emergency funding to stopgap SNAP shortages, and state lawmakers held a special session and passed $162.5 million more to cover SNAP payments if needed. Food banks across the state also saw sharp increases in need.
“This reapplication requirement comes after repeated efforts to deny Americans in need of essential nutrition assistance,” the letter reads. “In addition to unprecedented cuts to SNAP enacted earlier this summer, decisions to disrupt food assistance during the shutdown have created additional uncertainty. We are therefore troubled that the Administration could choose, at this moment, to add additional red tape that creates duplicative and unnecessary barriers to accessing nutrition assistance for families.”
The letter asks Rollins to explain how the “reapplication” plan would differ from the current recertification process in which states assess recipients’ eligibility each year; how the plan would remain “consistent” with the program’s existing rules; and when the USDA planned to issue “rulemaking or guidance” on its reapplication plan.
In response to questions about the reapplication proposal, a USDA spokesperson previously said: “Secretary Rollins wants to ensure the fraud, waste, and incessant abuse of SNAP ends” and that “using standard recertification processes for households is a part of that work.”
New Mexico state Republicans also recently voiced concerns about SNAP fraud, and called upon the Legislative Finance Council to expand an audit of the program to include investigation fraud.
NM GOP asks for fraud examination in newly approved SNAP audit

Luján, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Food and Nutrition, Specialty Crops, Organics, and Research, last week, along with Klobuchar and the whole Senate Democratic Caucus, introduced a bill to repeal all SNAP-related changes in the recently enacted “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/boxesoffood-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 12:57:23.769835

(Photo courtesy of University of West Florida)Manny Diaz Jr. is the sole finalist to become the next University of West Florida president, the Pensacola school announced over the weekend.
The move furthers Gov. Ron DeSantis’ mission to remake the school, located in a heavily conservative part of the state, in a more conservative light.
Diaz has been interim president at the university since July. Before that, he was the education commissioner under DeSantis and before that he was a Republican state senator and House member representing Hialeah.

“After reviewing all of the applicants and conducting in-person interviews, it became clear that Interim President Diaz’s experiences of working in higher education, shaping education policy in the Florida Legislature, and serving on the State University System of Florida Board of Governors — while also serving as Florida’s Education Commissioner — have uniquely prepared him to be UWF’s next president,” presidential search committee chair Zack Smith said in a news release.
UWF will host a community forum with Diaz, followed by a trustee vote on his presidency. Trustees’ approval would be subject to Board of Governors confirmation.
DeSantis in May called for “big changes” at UWF. Former President Martha Saunders resigned before her contract expired and the governor has remade the board of trustees with conservative figures.
Monday, DeSantis posted to X that Diaz “has hit the ground running – the sky is the limit for UWF!”
Although final contracts are negotiated by the UWF board chair, Diaz can expect between $800,000 and $1.2 million in total compensation, the Phoenix previously reported after trustees approved presidential search criteria. Trustees said at the time that they preferred that candidates hold a relevant graduate degree, although that was not required.
Diaz holds a bachelor’s degree from St. Thomas University and a master’s in educational leadership from Nova Southeastern. He’s previously served as chief operating officer at Doral College, an online school focusing on dual enrollment courses for charter school students.
As education commissioner, Diaz held a seat on the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System.
The desired candidate will have a “record of successful leadership in a complex organization, preferably in higher education, government, or a large nonprofit entity,” according to the criteria decided by the committee.

State law exempts university president searches from public scrutiny, so there’s no public record of who else had applied for the position.
Board of Governors regulations state that search committees are responsible for “recommending an unranked list of final applicants.”
“The search committee is required to submit more than two qualified applicants, selected by a majority vote of the search committee, to the board of trustees for consideration, other than in exceptional circumstances making fulfillment of this requirement infeasible, in which case the committee must discuss why fewer than three applicants are being recommended and whether additional applications should be considered,” BOG regulations state.
UWF is not the only school to interpret “unranked list” as a single candidate. The University of Florida named Santa Ono as its sole finalist earlier this year. Ono was later rejected after some conservatives expressed disfavor about his past diversity stances.
At Florida International University, three finalists were selected, according to the university, but two withdrew after discovering they were not the sole finalist, making former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez the sole finalist.
This story was updated to include DeSantis’ Monday social media post.

This is Stories From The States. I’m Chris Fitzsimon. Here at States Newsroom, we know there’s a lot going on around the country every week, in every state. This week, we’re talking about mid-decade redistricting. Texas and California have grabbed most of the headlines in the battle. Now, GOP led states like Indiana are facing pressure from the president to redistrict. All while some states like Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Utah already have enacted new maps for the 2026 midterm elections. But Utah’s case is unique. That redistricting fight was spearheaded by Utah voters who ultimately won. Firstm that’s where we’re heading, and we’ll hear from one of the plaintiffs in the case.
Katharine Biele  
All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Then we’ll check in with the Brennan Center for Justice to find out if all this mid-decade redistricting business is actually normal. Up first is a Utah News Dispatch reporter. We’ll hear from her in just a moment.
Chris Fitzsimon  
A Utah judge recently approved a redistricting map that would give Democratic candidates a good chance at winning one of the state’s US House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. This redistricting dispute started back in 2018 though, way before the Trump administration started pushing for mid-decade redistricting to rig the maps to try to keep control of the US House in 2026. Katie McKellar, a senior reporter from the Utah News Dispatch, has been closely covering this for years. She joins us now. Hi, Katie.
Katie McKellar  
Hi. Thanks for having me.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thanks for being with us. All right, let’s jump in. Tell us about this. This case, it nowhere near started just this year. Give us a little bit of background on what’s at stake here.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, there’s a long history here in Utah. So back in 2021, that year, the Republican majority Utah legislature repealed and replaced a ballot initiative that was narrowly approved by Utah voters in 2018. And that ballot initiative  driven by anti gerrymandering groups called Better Boundaries, sought to implement an independent redistricting process here in Utah, meant to guard against gerrymandering, and they argued that there were too many Democratic, independent and even more moderate Republican voters here that were being dispersed or cracked through the redistricting process. And so they put Proposition 4 on the ballot for voters to decide whether it should become law, and it passed. But Republican leaders here have long believed that they have the final say when it comes to ballot initiatives, and so they repealed and replaced Prop Four with a law known as SB 200 and essentially, what that law did was water down Prop Four and turn the independent redistricting commission that was supposed to draw the state’s maps into an advisory body that could ignore those maps.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So basically, the voters decided they wanted to do this with the independent commission. The Republican legislature said, ‘No, thanks’. We’re going to turn this into an advisory commission, even though the voters didn’t want that?
Katie McKellar  
Exactly, exactly. And so instead, they repealed and replaced that law with one that that turned into an advisory body that they could ignore. And so even though that independent commission drew a set of maps that year, lawmakers do their own and they adopted those maps and that congressional map and that set created four solidly Republican congressional districts, and that prompted pro democracy groups like the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who felt disenfranchised by that new congressional map to get together and sue. And they alleged that that 2021 map was a blatant gerrymander, and that lawmakers violated their rights to reform their government through a ballot initiative.
Chris Fitzsimon
So really, the lawsuit was about the ballot initiative as much as it was the districts. Sounds like.
Katie McKellar  
Absolutely it was about both. It was about gerrymandering and lawmakers overstepping on a ballot initiative. And so after that case spent several years winding through the courts. Ultimately, the Utah Supreme Court, on an appeal, sided with the plaintiffs on the claim that lawmakers violated their right to alter and reform their government, and that led a district court judge to deem the 2021 map the result of an unconstitutional process. So she didn’t rule, she didn’t weigh in on whether it was a gerrymander, but she did say it was an unlawful map because it was the result of repealing and replacing a ballot initiative. And so she she voided that 2021 map and ruled that Utah must go through a court ordered redistricting process to put in place a lawful congressional map to be used next year in the 2026 elections, and that’s how we got where we are today.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thank you. It’s not a simple topic. I think you did a great job explaining it for us. And so tell us when the Trump administration got involved and people thought that they were going to have some role in this.
Katie McKellar  
So while mid, mid decade redistricting is is a debate happening all over the country right now, Utah’s mid-decade redistricting process right now is unique, because this was court ordered this was a judge saying Utah lawmakers overstepped, we need to fix it. And so it’s very unique compared to the other conversations happening in states like California and Texas.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Right. And so now tell us what happened. The map that was chosen does appear to give Democrats a chance at winning one of these districts. From what I’ve read, a lot of this revolves around Salt Lake County, which is the most populous county in the state.
Katie McKellar  
Yeah, so over the last several a couple of months, really, this court ordered process took a long time. The judge took several weeks to hear from both sides, the legislative attorneys and attorneys for the plaintiffs and each side. She gave an opportunity to submit some maps to consider. So the legislature voted on a map known as map C that lawmakers contended abided by Proposition Four’s criteria, and that would be fair. And you know, looking at that map compared to the 2021 map, it is true that it was a bit more competitive for Democrats, but it would still result in four pretty solidly red congressional districts, and then the plaintiff submitted two options. One map was a lease change map based off of the map that the lawmakers approved to just kind of tweak the boundary so it didn’t split as many cities. Or they also submitted another one that was drawn with an algorithm that was created based off of Proposition Four’s criteria, and that map is the one the judge ultimately picked. And in that map, there’s the first congressional district is concentrated around the northern part of Salt Lake County, which is a very populated part of Utah. And the result is three pretty, like, really safe Republican districts, and one pretty safe Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon
Somebody described to me that the old maps that they were under and some of the proposals that weren’t adopted look like a pizza cutter had done them that they divided up most of the population into into pizza slices so the Republicans could maintain control.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, that has been a strategy for a long time. And you know, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit alleged was blatant gerrymandering Republicans here, they like to describe it as pizza slice, or mixing urban and rural voices, so that urban and rural voices in each district are represented on the federal level. Well, the plaintiffs allege, you know, that’s just cover to crack Salt Lake County into four different pieces so that there would not be a Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction there, when the court chose the map that gives the Democrats a chance to claim one of the districts?
Katie McKellar  
Oh, the the plaintiffs in the case were thrilled. They thought that was a great win, because that map, to them, was based wholly off of Propositions Four’s criteria. Democrats were thrilled, Republicans were angry. There’s been a ton of backlash from Republicans. I mean, even before the judge picked that map, some Republican lawmakers began saying, if she didn’t pick their map that they submitted to the court map see that they would argue it would amount to malfeasance, because they still firmly believe, despite all the court rulings, that the Utah constitution ultimately gives them and only them, the ability to pick maps in the redistricting process. And so couple of things have been happening. Republicans and a group called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing another ballot initiative to repeal Proposition Four to go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to consider. And in the meantime, I think we can still expect plenty of court appeals, legislative attorneys saying they’ll be willing to take it all the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary. But you know, barring some crazy upset, because we’ve already hit the deadline for a map to be used in 2026 even if they went on appeal. I don’t know if there’s even time to put a different map in place for 2026 but 2028 who knows? We’ll just have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon  
The judge has been attacked, right? And there’s even been like talks of impeaching the judge. It really has gone to a new level it seems like.
Katie McKellar
We’ll have to see if those threats are just threats, or if, if lawmakers actually try to carry that out. One lawmaker has said he’s open a bill file to do articles of impeachment, but I haven’t been able to get the senate president or the house speaker on record solidly saying yes, we’re going to try to impeach her, so we’ll have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon
Right. Well, we will check back with you. Katie, thanks for all your great reporting there, and thanks for being with us. Thanks. Chris. Katie McKellar is a senior reporter at the Utah News Dispatch. That outlet is a part of state’s newsroom. Since chatting with Katie, the Utah judiciary has issued a statement addressing threats to Judge Diana Gibson, who ruled on the maps. They addressed the heated political reaction as well as the threats of violence to Judge Gibson saying, “threats of violence against judges or court personnel are unacceptable, dangerous and may violate state of federal laws”. As Katie mentioned, the approved map drawn by the plaintiffs of Utah’s redistricting lawsuit was a collective effort of nonpartisan groups, faith based organizations, a legal center, and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who all said they just wanted fair maps. In a moment, we’ll meet one of the plaintiffs from that case. We’ll be right back.

Chris Fitzsimon  
After almost seven years of a legal battle against a GOP led state legislature in Utah, a broad coalition of plaintiffs finally had their congressional district map approved by federal judge. It wasn’t easy, and has involved a referendum that lawmakers ignored, legal machinations and now calls to impeach a judge. Joining us now with one of the people who was part of this redistricting fight, Katharine Biele is the President of the League of Women Voters of Utah. She joins us now. Hello, Katharine. Thanks for being here.
Katharine Biele  
Thank you so much Chris.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So Katharine, your group was one of the plaintiffs in this case, and now a judge has approved the maps you and other Utahns had sought, right.
Katharine Biele  
They did. I mean, we were thrilled.
Chris Fitzsimon
You were thrilled. I was gonna ask your reaction. Were you surprised?
Katharine Biele  
Not completely. We had very good arguments. I mean, our arguments were based in the Utah State Constitution, Article One, Section two, which gives the citizens the right to change the form of government. So we had a very good argument. We were never trying to leave the legislature out of it. We totally expect the legislature to draw the maps. All we require is that they draw them fairly.
Chris Fitzsimon
Just to be clear, the maps that had been drawn or that were drawn by the General Assembly, or the ones that they were were promoting, really, I always hear it as an outsider to Utah, hear it described as like pizza slices, which keeps sort of all the parts of Salt Lake City separated in effect.
Katharine Biele
And it’s not just Salt Lake City, but Salt Lake Salt Lake County. This is where the hub of the population lives. They divided the county into four slices going down to the very tip of Southern Utah, St George, so we in urban Salt Lake have the same representative as those down in southern Utah.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction from the legislature and the proponents, or the I guess the people who wanted to continue to draw the maps the way they had been drawn.
Katharine Biele  
The legislature is up in arms. They will not stop this should have been easy. I mean, how hard is it to draw a fair map? It’s not a partisan thing. It is. Just look, this is these are communities of interest. Salt Lake County is one community of interest. Southern Utah is another. The rural, rural areas are another. So it’s just really not that hard. They were furious because they thought we were taking away their responsibility, which we are not.
Chris Fitzsimon  
You know, Utah has a reputation, I think, from afar, and I think I’m sure it feels that way a lot of times in Utah you have Republican governors in the past have reached across the aisle. There’s been a lot of national publicity. They’ve been the leaders in sort of a different kind of campaigning. So I think there’s a perception that politics in Utah hasn’t gotten to the bitter level that we’ve seen around the country. And yet it feels like in this case, maybe that has changed some.
Katharine Biele  
I will say that it may be changing a little. This is all based around the national politics and the kind of national politics that are coming down to Utah. There are many people here, many legislators who think that whatever Trump says and whatever he does, they should do however. We also have enough. I mean, we respect the legislature, and the legislators do have good intentions. They just have to get away from the whole idea that only Republicans can be in charge of everything.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Do you have trouble as a citizen activist or a member of an organization, getting some voters to understand really what’s at stake. I think sometimes, even when I’m talking to folks about redistricting battles, and we’ve had a lot of them in states that I’ve been in, people sometimes their eyes glaze over and they want to talk about a lot of other issues. But this feels like a in some cases, a technical thing.
Katharine Biele  
Well, and this is it’s hard, it is very difficult, and I think the legislature has made it even. More difficult on purpose. They want the citizens to be confused and to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to leave it to the legislature, because we don’t get it.’ It’s not that hard. All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter. We don’t all win. We just need to have a voice. I have heard as a league of women voters. We register voters all the time. What they say to us is, why should we vote? We know what the outcome will be. This at least gives those voters a chance. Is it over? No, it probably will never be over. I mean, the legislature has talked about appealing. You know, if they appeal to the Supreme Court, that is really a delaying tactic, because our Supreme Court ruled unanimously in our favor. So it’s unlikely that they would do anything different. But I can’t say I’m not a lawyer. They have talked about running an initiative, which is ironic, a citizens initiative to overturn a citizens initiative. And that is exactly what you said. It’s because people are confused, and they think, Oh, well, we can confuse them more, and they will just vote our way to get rid of Proposition Four.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Well, I really appreciate you being with us, and thanks for all your efforts for democracy there in Utah. Thank you very much.
Katharine Biele
Thank you too.

This week, a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 2026 election. Texas was the first state pushed by the President to take part in this unusual mid-decade redistricting scheme. This move has led state lawmakers across the country to talk about redistricting when they only discuss it every 10 years. Is all this mid decade redistricting now going to be the new normal nationally? Coming up, an expert from the Brennan Center for Justice will help us figure that out. Then Evening Wrap newsletter author Danielle Gaines will join us about the story she’s looking out for. We’ll be right back.

Congressional district maps are generally redrawn every decade after the US Census, unless a court intervenes and orders state lawmakers to redraw them to settle a lawsuit. But the Trump administration has been pushing GOP led states to redistrict this year, purely for political reasons, to make it harder for Democrats to take over control of the House in the 2026 election. What are the long term effects of the break from precedent, and what happens if it becomes the new normal and maps are drawn every two years instead of every 10? We spoke with Kareem Crayton. He’s the vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Washington DC office, and he has a doctorate in political science. Just a note. We spoke with Kareem before the news broke in Texas this week where a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 26th election. Now they have to go back to their 2021 maps, which, by the way, are already gerrymandered by the Republican controlled General Assembly. He joins us now, Kareem, thanks for being here. Delight to be with you. Thank you. Well, what do you make of this overall? I think if we were sitting here a year ago, it’s hard to imagine the pressure being brought on so many states to dramatically change the way they draw district lines.
Kareem Crayton
Yeah, about a year ago, I think most of us thought that the only movement was going to be in the courts, with things that were already on the table. I think it is hard to have predicted such a massive number of states jumping into the pool and that most of the disruption and chaos is coming really at the instigation of the White House.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It puts a good government advocates like folks at the Brennan Center in a bit of a tough place at the beginning of all this national mid-decade redistricting discourse, after Governor Greg Abbott announced that he was doing that in Texas, there was a lot of discussion about, should states that have commissions or states that are committed to trying to drawing on gerrymandered districts also play what did you make of that sort of the machinations there?
Kareem Crayton  
Well, I would say the tough position that we’ve been in is actually one that preceded Governor Abbott’s move, and it is where the Supreme Court of the United States failed to adopt a national standard. In the absence of that, notwithstanding the fact that the Supreme Court said it had no particular opinion about political gerrymandering, number of states saw that as an invitation. And I think what we’re seeing is the result of that. So both. For what Texas has done, and California and other states have done, in reaction, is in some ways not surprising, if also quite lamentable.
Chris Fitzsimon  
To have a legislature, for example, Texas, who already gerrymandered the districts with their own majority come back and, in effect, re gerrymander them. Is this? What is this unprecedented? Had you seen anything like this before?
Kareem Crayton  
I think, writ large, it is unprecedented. It is fair to say that states have gone back to the well in the past, first time where we’ve seen, you know, the legislature in Texas at least go back and say, Oh, we didn’t gerrymander enough. And certainly, when you add to that, the National reaction where some states are going back to say, the public, we want to do a re gerrymandering of this state, is that okay, in light of all the other things that you’ve seen, and in California, the people said, Yes,
Chris Fitzsimon  
I covered redistricting in North Carolina for a long time. And what do you make of this? For the voters? I think it’s already sort of hard to explain to folks who don’t do this for a living, who are just living their lives trying to make ends meet, and now they can’t vote for the person they used to their districts are different. How do you communicate this effectively, the importance of this to folks who aren’t really involved in the political process.
Kareem Crayton  
The people that are supposed to be served by the redrawing of districts are the people who are supposed to be represented, and those are voters, and not the electeds. And what you see with these changes, in the absence of a national standard is that people who live right next to each other, who share the same city, who understand the same sets of issues that affect them all are now divided by essentially arbitrary lines, and they’re done really for no other purpose than to serve a political interest, and in fact, an interest that might not even be in the state that’s supposed to be represented. So I think all of these, you know, line drawing and re line drawing efforts are bringing people farther and farther away from power and democratic system. People aren’t supposed to be, particularly in elections, the source of power, and that’s of real concern.
Chris Fitzsimon  
We also had some news recently from the Indiana Capitol Chronicle, despite visits from the vice president and pressure from the president, many Republicans there are choosing not to participate in this mid cycle redistricting.
Kareem Crayton
Well, we’re seeing a lot of folks, I think, look at this and say, one, what does it cost us to try to do this? Yes, maybe the White House really wants us to do it, but what do we lose by going back to the will and redrawing the map? And frankly, it is probably not off of anybody’s mind. The fact that we had elections in November that I think, surprised a lot of people. And so if you’re doing these redraws, you’ve got to think about the world, not just as it exists right now, but what it’s going to look like a year from now and beyond. And in places where, if you’re a Republican you’re looking at, you know, what was pretty much a clean sweep behind the Democratic Party. And you got to wonder, is there a line at which and pardon the pun, but yes, if you cross that line in drawing new district maps, do you make yourself less likely in a democratic wave year to be competitive? Again? This is sort of done from the perspective of partisanship. But what is lost in all of this is the people ultimately are going to want to choose. And I think the real challenge that a lot of people are grappling with is, well, look, we might want a certain political outcome, but if the public overwhelmingly sees us as grabbing more power than we’re due, it might be that there’s a wave so big that we can’t gerrymander our way out of it.
Chris Fitzsimon
You mentioned a national standard. Is there some, some world, ideal world, where all this publicity and frustration leads us back to a conversation about how everybody should do redistricting in some fair and open and honest way?
Kareem Crayton
Well, I certainly hope so. The Congress of the United States still has the ability to say to the public, you know what? We hear you. And there should be a national standard, and we’re going to carve one. To carve one out that might not be true, that may or may not be true of this existing Congress, but the public is frustrated enough. It’s entirely possible that, you know, the public votes for people who will step into the breach. And by the way, it’s important to note you now hear both Republicans and Democrats, often, many of them on the losing end of a redistricting fight. Say, though there should be a national standard. So I think the more that becomes, as you point out, a priority for the public as a whole, but also for the elected to recognize. You know, in the main, this may or may not be a matter of whether or not I gain from a particular line drop, or whether the country gains overall from a system that makes sure that people at the forefront of how districts get drawn
Chris Fitzsimon

Coming up. We’ll check with evening rap newsletter writer Danielle Gaines, stay with us.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Joining us now is Danielle Gaines. She writes States Newsrooms, daily newsletter called The Evening Wrap Danielle, it’s great to see you. Let’s let’s jump in. Talk about the big things this week and what’s coming up. First of all. What big stories Did you notice this week?
Danielle Gaines
Well, we’ve had some coverage about the changes that are coming to programs in the United States who have typically assisted refugees when they arrive here, and so our reporter in Rhode Island spent some time at the refugee Dream Center there, and she was talking with women in a class that’s meant to improve their English skills, but it’s also about so much more for them. So it’s like cultural, emotional, social. It was a really beautiful story just getting to know the women, but it also kind of touched on the fact that this was a place that is meant to be filled with love help these people feel at home, and instead, a lot of the emotion there has been replaced with fear, which is all too familiar to this group of people and uncertainty the folks who go there are among hundreds of 1000s of lawful immigrants who will soon lose food benefits in the US, as provisions of the one big, beautiful Bill act take effect. And in addition to food benefits, there are other things coming up that are big changes for programs that we established to help people get on their feet so the work requirements and Medicaid are going to be a problem. These are folks who aren’t working because they’re trying to gain proficiency in English so they can work, and they’ll lose support during that process. The story also had an economic analysis of refugees and immigrants in Rhode Island that I found really interesting. So 15% of the state are immigrants, and $5.5 million in annual food benefits will be gone under these provisions, and soon child tax credits will be gone as well, to the tune of $30 million so it’s a big shift on a family level, but also, you know, on a state economic level,
Chris Fitzsimon  
Yeah, I think that bill still feels like it’s hanging over so many people. When the when those provisions take effect?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, one of the coordinators there said that’s going to be, quote, disastrous, once it all kind of takes shape together.
Chris Fitzsimon
What about coming up next? What about things to look for?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, so this week, I’ve been featuring a special mini series from our reproductive rights reporting team on the state of state shield protections for abortion medications. And so there’s a lot that has been going on with that, and a lot that is going to be going on with that. So over the series of stories, our team looked at the status of state shield laws as well as efforts to puncture them, as well as challenges to mifepristone in lawsuits and the federal regulatory level. So there is an ongoing lawsuit related to the federal regulations The ACLU is seeking information, kind of just looking at what is the Trump administration’s FDA actually looking at with these long established medications, and who are they talking to as they’re looking at it. So that’s a lawsuit to be on the lookout for. And then on the state side of things, shield laws that protect abortion providers have been established in lots of states to protect them from out of state lawsuits, but a new bill is taking effect in Texas, and that aims to kind of puncture the durability of those laws. It’s was described as the first bill in the country to explicitly target shield laws and shield providers, and it gives any Texan the power to sue anyone involved in mailing an abortion pill to the state. So we’ll have to see what unfolds there.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It seems like then, I mean, it’s been ongoing, but the next frontier of the whole abortion debate seems like the battle over these, this medication and access to it. Yes, agreed. Well, what about one last thing? What shall we leave us together with?
Danielle Gaines
Well, just a time for Thanksgiving. I figured that we’d talk about food waste, not to be a downer, timely, but our friends at the Iowa capital dispatch covered a study by the State Department of Natural Resources, and that study found that Iowans throw away, on average, 200 pounds of food each year. When you account for industrial food waste. On top of that, it’s about 300 pounds. Wow. And that’s actually less than what the EPA estimates for the country as a whole, which is between 492 pounds and more than 1000 pounds. So this study was just a way to look at how to cut down on food waste, how food waste can be diverted, how to avoid it in the first place. So I thought I’d share some of the tips that I gleaned from it. You know, the first one is to purchase your food thoughtfully, and then, in terms of disposal, you can seek ways to donate something that you don’t want, share it with a neighbor, a friend, compost it instead of sending it to the landfill. My personal favorite is to just immediately freeze. So if you have a veggie tray at Thanksgiving, like, don’t just shove it the back of your fridge to let it waste away. Cut it up right away, put it in a baggie, and then some night, you’ll want soup, and it’ll be right there, ready cut up for you.
Chris Fitzsimon  
That’s a great idea. It does seem at every party, the veggie tray is the last to go.
Danielle Gaines  
I know it’s such a shame. I also think you could waffle iron just about anything. From Thanksgiving, which is a great way to use up leftovers.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Wow, I haven’t thought of that one. I might try that. Do I really appreciate you as always you being with us.
Danielle Gaines  
Yes, thank you so much.

Kevin Ryan dies in hospice at 73,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/ct-state-rep-kevin-ryan-dies-in-hospice-at-73/,"Rep. Kevin Ryan, a Montville Democrat who served in the state House of Representatives through the tenures of five governors, died Sunday.","Rep. Kevin Ryan, a Montville Democrat who served in the state House of Representatives through the tenures of five governors and found redemption after a mid-career struggle with alcohol, died Sunday night, two days after entering hospice care in West Hartford. Ryan was 73.
Ritter House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, confirmed the death of Ryan, who had been in treatment for cancer. Ryan had made no public disclosure about his illness and was relatively circumspect with many colleagues and staff, finally consenting to a steady stream of visitors.
Ritter and his father, former House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, visited Ryan on Sunday. The elder Ritter was elected speaker by the class of lawmakers elected in 1992, Ryan among them. At his death, Ryan was serving the younger Ritter as a deputy speaker. 
Ryan was elected in 1992 from the 139th House District of Ledyard, Montville and Norwich, a year after the tumultuous 1991 session that produced the state income tax under the leadership of a third-party governor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
He arrived in Hartford with a multiple degrees from Villanova and a doctorate in optometry from the Pennsylvania College of Optometry. He had a keen sense for detail that made him valued as a bill screener. He later earned a master’s degree in community psychology from the University of New Haven.
But he also had a blue-collar sensibility and affinity for working-class struggles and served for eight years as the co-chair of the Labor and Public Employees Committee.
“He and his father worked for a living, delivering wholesale groceries throughout New England,” said Michael Caron, a former Republican House member. “He was a man of faith, integrity, resilience and redemption.”
“Kevin never failed to stand up for the working families of our state, helping to shape Connecticut’s public health and labor laws,” said Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, who served with Ryan in the House. “And, whether it was by educating our college students in his day job or entertaining my own children when they visited the legislature, Kevin was deeply committed to enriching the lives of our youngest residents.”
Ryan had taught physics at the University of New Haven.
Growing up with a father who ran his own business was a lasting influence, Ryan said in a profile published by the Council of State Governments, a group he led last year.
“It reflects in a lot of my decisions,” Ryan said. “I keep in mind the small business owner since that’s who I’m most familiar with, and really recognizing [that] a lot of people consider business owners to be honest. A lot of them are very hardworking individuals who are just trying to be able to pay their bills and take care of their families.” 
The legislature became family to Ryan, who was unmarried. Ryan would be a frequent holiday dinner guest Caron’s home. He was godfather to Caron’s son.
As he ended the first of his three decades in the House, Ryan’s struggles with alcohol became public. He was sentenced to 120 days in prison in 2001 after a third conviction for driving under the influence. He promised to respond to constituents from prison.
“I have always taken great pride in providing service to the good people of the 139th District and that will continue during my absence,” he said then.
Friends rallied around him. Ryan entered rehab, and Caron said his friend had no further troubles with alcohol. His political rehab was similarly successful: Ryan easily was reelected in 2022, winning by 1,000 votes.
“He would not let it define who he was,” Caron said. “He never had another problem. He did his penance.”
Ryan had a sarcastic sense of humor, evident to anyone who passed his desk on the aisle in the House.
“If he didn’t jab, he didn’t like you,” Caron said.
Ritter described Ryan as someone who spoke bluntly in private yet viewed himself as a team player. 
“He told you what he was thinking,” Ritter said. “For all his fierce independence, Kevin was loyal at the end of the day.”
Funeral arrangements were incomplete. A service is expected after the Thanksgiving holiday.
The state flag over the state Capitol was lowered to half-staff Monday at the order of Gov. Ned Lamont.
“He loved public service and was always ready and willing to listen to the views of the people he represented and take action to support their interests,” Lamont said. “Throughout my tenure as governor, Kevin has been one of the friendliest legislators that I’ve had the opportunity to work with, and I am going to miss his clever, sharp and humorous personality.”
Ryan missed the special session in November, but he served throughout the annual session that ended at midnight June 4. He cast a vote at 11:52 p.m., the final act of the House in its 2025 regular session.
Ritter and House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, noted in a joint statement that Ryan “took great pride in being the only person in the building who pronounced Norwich correctly.”
In Ryan’s view, there was no R in the city’s name.
“The Capitol will feel emptier without him,” they said, “but the impact he made on his community, on this institution, and on each of us will endure.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2024_0501_SR_LastDaySession_105-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-24 11:57:57.257274
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-24 16:50:00+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: Is nuclear energy the future in CT?,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/podcast-ct-nuclear-energy-future/,WSHU's Ebong Udoma and CT Mirror's Jan Ellen Spiegel discuss her article about whether nuclear plays a role in Connecticut's energy future.,"Connecticut has some of the highest energy prices in the country, and experts and lawmakers are in a race to find a cheaper, environmentally friendly option.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Jan Ellen Spiegel to discuss her article, “Could CT have a nuclear energy future? Not if you’re in a rush,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Jan’s article here.
WSHU: Hello, Jan. Policymakers have been discussing small modular nuclear reactors as a more accessible and faster way for Connecticut to increase power production, particularly in the wake of the Trump administration’s limited support for new wind and solar energy projects. What prompted you to write this particular story?
JES: What prompted me to do this particular story is, in a sense, exactly what you said, that they were not putting any emphasis on other forms of carbon-free energy, and states like Connecticut have laws on the books where they have to do a certain amount of that. So what are the alternatives here? And I wanted to look at a whole series of things to really understand what’s out there, what’s real, and do some reality checking on what all this actually can mean. And nuclear gets talked about, as you just pointed out, all the time. And I knew enough, I guess, to be dangerous to know that that probably wasn’t quite an accurate way of looking at it. And it turns out it is not quite an accurate way to look at it.
WSHU: So basically, you found out that small modular nuclear reactors don’t actually exist.
JES: For the most part, no. They have been talked about for quite some time. Various sorts of newer reactor technology have been out there, and it’s not so new, because it’s been around somewhere between 50 and 70 years. Countries, various companies have been working with this, and they really haven’t got it to a point where it’s going to work very well, so there’s going to be a very long time before any of these can really get built.
WSHU: You found out that they’re not that small either.
JES: There’s a category called advanced nuclear energy. It’s kind of what I refer to as a garbage pail term, in which you put a whole bunch of stuff in there. There are these supposed small modular reactors, which can be, you know, 300-400 megawatts. They can go smaller than that, but at this point, that’s pretty big for a power plant. Then there are also these micro reactors, which can be very, very, very small. They exist even less than the small modular reactors do, and have really been used anywhere. But they’re kind of a different sort of animal, and there’s still a whole lot of action that would need to happen in the US and other countries as well, before these things can really come into existence. They also cost a ton of money.
WSHU: Okay, let’s talk a little bit about cost. We haven’t had a nuclear reactor built in years in the U.S. The last one was built in Georgia. How long ago was that?
JES: There were two reactors that were added to some existing reactors in Georgia, and those were finished in 2023 and 2024. They are a new type of reactor, but they’re full-size reactors. They were more than double their original budget. They were seven years late. They were developed by Westinghouse, which has been in the nuclear reactor business for a long time. Prior to that, it had been like 30 years. A lot of it has to do with the various nuclear accidents that happened over time. And there was a lot of, hey, let’s think twice about doing another one of these. But those reactors, what I was hearing from a lot of different people, and uniquely in this story, I was hearing the same things over and over again from people. Usually, you get a certain amount of nuance and slightly different opinions, but I was hearing the same thing over and over again, the big reactors that were built down in Georgia, they feel are actually a really good technology. Now, whether you can take those big reactors and make them into a smaller one would remain to be seen. We don’t know that yet.
WSHU: Now, even in Connecticut, Millstone, the operator of Millstone, doesn’t appear too keen on this, although there was talk about having some modular reactors set up at the same site where the Millstone reactor is right now. You talked to them, and they didn’t seem too keen on the idea of these modular reactors. Could you talk a little bit more about that?
JES: Yeah, what I need to do first is kind of explain the pricing issue on this, because this is where their reluctance comes in. Yes, the upfront costs of building a smaller reactor are going to be less. They’re smaller. They may take up less space. The front-loaded price is just going to be lower. But if you look at the long term, and I heard this over and over and over again, if you look at the price per unit of power produced, it will actually be more expensive. And it’s basic economies of scale. The bigger you go, the smaller the price per unit. I mean, this goes for nuclear plants. It probably goes for toilet paper too. That is where the issue comes down for Connecticut, where we have a deregulated utility system, where rate payers will bear the costs of power development of any sort.
And as I’m sure everyone is aware, there have been tremendous concerns about this over the last, well, forever, but you know, really seriously over the last 10-15 years. So it’s that deregulated system that we have that concerns the owners of Millstone Dominion, which is looking at potentially developing a small modular reactor down in Virginia. And, you know, frankly, it was a surprise to me when I got a comment back that what the spokesperson said, we’re not opposed to an SMR at Millstone, she said, but it might not have the regulatory environment for run, for one, the upfront costs of an SMR, though less expensive than traditional nuclear, are significant enough that Connecticut’s deregulated market might not support such a project. Now, I have been hearing that. I heard that from her, and I heard that the commissioner of unsolicited from the Commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said the same thing. Various nuclear experts said to me, Well, you know, Connecticut has a deregulated utility. It might be really tough to do there. So this kept coming up over and over again, and that might be the issue for Connecticut, at least the way things exist right now.
WSHU: Now, also, you have a situation here where Katie Dykes, the Commissioner, also spoke with you about the fact that you need a lot of lead time for any of this new technology and energy generation, and there’s a lot of money, so you have to plan years ahead. And she gave the example of the wind power that ran into some problems from the Trump administration this past summer, which took quite a while to get to where we are with wind. And so this is energy that will not be available in the very near future.
JES: Yeah, and again, it is something I heard from everybody. There are two components. Number one, just planning ahead on a technological basis, with that much of a lead time, the actual technology, the odds of it potentially changing, are extremely high. We see that happen all the time. You know, think about your computer, as soon as you take it out of the box, it’s dated, right? This stuff changes. The other piece of it is the need for additional power. Seems to be more of a now thing, not 10-15, years in the future, and in talking to a former chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Allison McFarlane, she basically said, if you’re looking to address climate change or address the needs from AI, something like that, which is, you know, presumed to use up a lot of power, she said, it means you have to address it immediately, like yesterday. And none of these technologies are available, even if they were available this very second, you’re still talking 10-15 years down the road. Everyone has said, don’t even think about this stuff before, sometime in the 20-30s, that is not going to do a whole lot of good if you need the power now.
WSHU: I like the quote you ended your article with, which is a quote from MacFarlane herself, and she says, to put all our treasure in nuclear energy right now is not very smart.
JES: This is someone who ran the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a while, but you know, again, it’s what you also hear from all kinds of people who are looking at various forms of power.

What’s more, as we were reminded in a conversation this past week with NC Newsline poverty and housing reporter Greg Chidress, it’s a challenge that’s only been made worse by real and threatened federal funding cuts and the uncertainty those cuts are driving amongst the heroic service providers here and elsewhere who do their best to help the unhoused and expand the housing stock.
Happily, the story is not exclusively bleak. As Childress reminded us, there is evidence of a growth in new housing construction in some communities. What’s more, as was highlighted in a recent story he authored about a dynamic young activist and nonprofit leader in the city of Kinston, local advocacy and entrepreneurship can still make a real difference in addressing this daunting problem.

The new report also shows that wealthy Idahoans in the top 1% of earners – those with an annual income of $738,300 and above – benefited the most from the income tax cuts. 
The report, “2025 Update: Idaho’s String of Income Tax Cuts Continues to Jeopardize Investments in Public Services,” was published by the Boise-based Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy. 
“The report found that over the past five years since the income tax cuts started, those tax cuts cost the state almost $4 billion in lost revenue during that time,” Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy Policy Director Kendra Knighten said in an interview Friday. “Those are dollars that could have been invested in public education, or that could have gone into improving our roads and public safety. They could have gone into helping support Medicaid to help keep Idahoans healthy. Those are all dollars that the Legislature chose to provide tax relief with instead of investing in our communities, and that is something that we are really concerned about.”
“Beyond that, those are also dollars that we don’t have available to use to respond to in times during a recession,” Knighten said. 
The report was issued just as the state of Idaho is grappling with 3% budget holdbacks, revenue shortfalls and a projected state budget deficit of $58.3 million for the current fiscal year 2026, the Idaho Capital Sun has previously reported. 
In simple terms, revenue is the amount of money the state takes in. The largest sources of state general fund revenue are taxes – specifically the individual income tax, sales tax and corporate income tax. 
This is important because the Idaho Constitution requires the Idaho Legislature to pass a balanced budget every year and prohibits the state from spending more in its budget than the state collects in revenue. 
Cutting taxes has the effect of both reducing the amount of money Idahoans and companies pay in taxes, as well as reducing the amount of revenue available to the state. 
 Idaho income tax cuts benefited wealthy Idahoans, companies, report finds

The new Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy report found that the top 1% of earners making more than $738,300 per year received an average annual tax cut of $20,407 through the income tax cuts.
Meanwhile, the lowest 20% of earners – those with an annual income of less $31,100 – benefited the least from the income tax cuts. The lowest 20% of earners saw their incomes taxes cut by an average of $33 per year, according to the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy report. 
A new report from the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy found that income tax cuts passed by the Idaho Legislature benefited the wealthiest Idahoans the most. (Chart provided courtesy of Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy)
Officials with the policy center warn that reducing state revenue by such large amounts reduces the amount of money the state of Idaho has to invest in core public services like public schools, transportation, public safety and infrastructure.
May Roberts, a policy analyst for the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy, said that if the state cuts budgets during times of economic hardship or uncertainty, it can be difficult to recover from those cuts.
Roberts published a report earlier this month that showed – when adjusted for inflation – Idaho’s per-pupil funding for public schools still lags behind funding levels reached prior to the 2001 recession. Funding levels have recovered from the 2008 recession, Roberts found, but still lag behind where they stood more than 20 years ago, once adjusted for inflation.
“Budget cuts that happen during times of economic hardship have long-lasting effects on the budget,” Roberts said Friday. “It can be difficult to bounce back and reach the level of investment we had in the past once those budgets are cut.” 
 Idaho House Speaker Moyle, conservative orgs say tax cuts benefit Idahoans

Each of the tax cuts tracked in the new report was supported or co-sponsored by House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, the powerful, longest-serving and highest-ranking member of the Idaho House of Representatives.

Efforts to reach Moyle on Friday were unsuccessful.
But for years Moyle has led the charge to reduce income tax rates and championed the benefit of tax cuts.
“This is the people’s money, not ours in government,” Moyle said in a written statement issued in March following the passage of House Bill 40 in the Idaho Legislature. “Today, we are delivering the single largest income tax cut in state history, and we are just getting started. Giving back the people’s money has always been and will remain a top priority of mine as Speaker.”
On April 4, the day the 2025 legislative session adjourned, Moyle predicted the 2025 legislative session would be remembered for tax cuts.
“We have over $400 million in tax relief this year,” Moyle said in an April 4 press conference. 
“We touched income tax. We touched property tax. We touched sales tax. We did a good job of adjusting all of those in a downward trend, which is good for the state of Idaho.”
The conservative Mountain States Policy Center has also championed tax cuts in Idaho.
“While we wait to see which taxes are reduced and by how much this year in Idaho, we should appreciate the good economic policies and fiscal discipline that make this debate possible,” Mountain States Policy Center officials wrote in a newsletter issued Jan. 9, during the first week of the 2025 legislative session. “The ‘Idaho Way’ of prioritizing tax relief leads to a much brighter economic future than the tax-and-spend mentality of our neighbors to the West.”
Idaho Gov. Brad Little, who signed the tax cuts into law, has vocalized both support for cutting taxes and concerns about reducing state revenues.
“Idaho families and businesses need and deserve to keep more of their hard earned money,” Little said in a written statement issued March 6. “It is the right thing to do. Idaho’s continued strength comes from our focus on good government and the Idaho taxpayer. I appreciate my partners in the Legislature for sharing our goal of prioritizing tax relief while taking care of the needs of a growing state. As we continue to deliver historic tax relief, we must ensure our budget balances as the Idaho Constitution requires.”
Efforts to reach Little for comment on Friday were unsuccessful. However, during a February breakfast with Idaho reporters, Little expressed concern about the Idaho Legislature reducing revenue by $450 million during the 2025 legislative session. The $450 million went to paying for new tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for education expenses outside of the public school system, including tuition at private, religious schools.
“If I would have thought we could do $450 (million), I would have proposed $450 (million),” Little told reporters Feb. 25.
 Which laws and tax cuts were analyzed for the new budget report?

For the new report, the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy Center analyzed five years of tax cuts.
Those tax cut laws include:

House Bill 380, 2021 legislative session: The law reduced all income tax brackets, reduced the number of tax brackets from seven to five and reduced the top corporate and income tax brackets to 6.5%
House Bill 436, 2022 legislative session: The law reduced the number of tax brackets from five to four, reduced individual income tax rates, lowered the corporate income tax rate to 6% and provided a one-time tax rebate.
House Bill 1, 2022 special legislative session: The law created a flat income tax system by reducing the number of tax brackets to one, reduced the corporate and income tax rates to 5.8%, provided a one-time tax rebate and provided funding taken from sales tax collections for the public school income fund.
House Bill 521, 2024 legislative session: The law reduced the income tax rate from 5.8% to 5.695% and provided additional money from sales tax collections to funds for public schools.
House Bill 40, 2025 legislative session: The law reduced the income tax rate from 5.695% to 5.3% and made other tax changes.

Sober Ride vouchers are available to help make that decision easier, and officials hope the added convenience encourages more people to take advantage of the program.
Jamie Kleman Contributing Writer Delaware Live | November 2025
The Delaware Office of Highway Safety has officially launched its annual holiday road safety campaign featuring the Sober Ride Vouchers, an effort designed to reduce crashes during what is consistently one of the most dangerous travel periods of the year. With more cars on the road, celebrations that involve alcohol, unpredictable weather and increased foot traffic, state officials say the timing could not be more important.
The campaign features two major components. The first is the popular Sober Rides program, which provides up to twenty dollars in rideshare credits through Lyft and Uber. The program is meant to give residents a simple and reliable way to choose a safe ride home. The first voucher window opens on Thanksgiving Eve, Wednesday, November 26, beginning at 3 p.m. and running through 3 a.m. the following morning. Additional voucher periods will roll out through the holiday season, including New Year’s Eve, which historically brings a spike in impaired driving.
The second component, Safe Holiday Travels, focuses on five core safety areas: impaired driving, speeding, occupant protection, distracted driving, and pedestrian awareness. Through community outreach and informational materials, the initiative encourages drivers and pedestrians to stay alert, slow down, and make intentional, responsible choices.
OHS Director Sharon Bryson emphasized that the holiday season brings a unique blend of risks. She noted that festivities often involve alcohol, families travel between gatherings and crowded shopping areas significantly increase the number of pedestrians. She said the goal of the campaign is to keep the holidays safe for everyone by offering tools, information and accessible alternatives to unsafe driving.
Between 2020 and 2024, Delaware recorded 641 fatal crashes, with 39 percent involving alcohol or drugs. In 2024 alone, the state saw 1,033 impaired driving crashes. Officials say these numbers reinforce the need for programs that not only educate but also provide practical solutions for residents.
As part of the outreach effort, street teams will be positioned across all three counties. Teams will visit bars, restaurants, liquor stores, YMCAs, DMVs, and other high-traffic areas to distribute educational materials in both English and Spanish. Messaging will focus on simple reminders to plan ahead, buckle up, avoid distractions, and be mindful of pedestrians.
For Delaware residents heading out to celebrate this week, the reminder is straightforward. Make a plan, know your options, and choose the safest way home.

One by one, the prisoners — all immigrants — appeared briefly over video before a special panel of the Louisiana parole board.
The August hearings were unusual in a state that, under Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, has made it increasingly difficult for most prisoners to get early release.
Unlike normal parole hearings, the board didn’t grill the prospective parolees about their crimes — ranging from car theft to vehicular homicide — to gauge their remorse. Nor did it review their disciplinary records to determine if they posed a threat to public safety. And no one was present to represent or speak on behalf of their victims.

In fact, most of the nine men, clad in black-and-white-striped jumpsuits or plain orange ones, did not say a word besides their names and inmate numbers. Only one was even eligible for parole.
But in each case, the three-member panel voted unanimously for release after just a few minutes of consideration.
“Today you’ve been paroled,” panel chair Steve Prator said at the end of every hearing, “to go straight into an ICE facility for deportation from the United States.”
Some thanked the board. Others sat stone-faced or simply nodded.
These days, a 100% grant rate is unheard of for the Louisiana Board of Parole. Where annual parole rates previously stood around 50%, in the two years since Landry became governor, less than a quarter of those eligible have been paroled.
Landry, a former police officer and sheriff’s deputy who served as Louisiana attorney general until 2024, has blasted early release programs as an insult to crime victims, insisting that anyone who is convicted in Louisiana should serve the entirety of their sentence. He pushed Republican lawmakers to eliminate parole entirely for those arrested after Aug. 1, 2024, and to impose strict eligibility requirements for those already in prison.
But this year the same Legislature tossed all of that aside for one category of prisoner: immigrants without legal status. With mass deportations a key policy priority for President Donald Trump, Republican-led state and local governments have taken aggressive steps to deliver. In May, Landry signed an order seeking to “crack down on criminal illegal aliens” by granting the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections and other state agencies the authority to conduct certain Immigration and Customs Enforcement duties. In June, Louisiana lawmakers created an expedited “alien removal process” through the special parole panel that passed with little notice during the last legislative session.
“They have the ability to release a lot of people to parole, and they’re choosing to only do it for this specific group because it’s politically popular,” said Bridget Geraghty, senior counsel with the MacArthur Justice Center, a Chicago-based legal nonprofit focused on prison reform.
At least two other Republican-led states have recently put in place similar initiatives to parole and deport prisoners without legal status. South Dakota paroled 10 immigrant prisoners to be deported over the summer. In Oklahoma, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt announced in February that the state had identified about 525 prisoners subject to deportation.
Since the Aug. 27 hearings in Louisiana, at least two of the nine men paroled have been deported, while two others from Vietnam are being held at a newly designated immigration detention facility on the grounds of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, according to ICE. Neither ICE nor the Landry administration would answer questions about the locations of the five other parolees or whether they are being deported to their home countries of Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua.
On Sept. 21, ICE’s regional office in New Orleans posted a photo of one of the parolees, Samuel Lara Garcia, handcuffed in front of a staircase leading to a plane. The agency identified Garcia as a citizen of Honduras.
“HOMICIDE DEPORTATION,” the X post blared.
Garcia, 36, had pleaded guilty to negligent homicide and obstruction of justice in a 2022 shooting after an argument at a Baton Rouge house party. He was sentenced to 13 years in 2024 but had served less than two years in prison before being paroled.

A U.S. citizen convicted of the same crime — or any crime — in Louisiana today would not be eligible for release under the new parole laws championed by Landry.
ICE declined an interview request with Madison Sheahan, a former Landry administration official who as deputy ICE director signed the partnership agreement between the agency and the corrections department. The Landry administration did not respond to questions about the new parole panel or the governor’s broader executive order, which was named Operation Geaux.
One member of that task force is Keith Conley, police chief of Kenner, a New Orleans suburb and one of the first Louisiana cities to formally partner with federal immigration authorities during Trump’s second term. He praised the legislation that created the deportation panel in a recent interview. Paroling and deporting prisoners who are illegally in the United States frees up jail space and saves tax dollars, Conley said, “so it just seems like a win, win.”
Under the new law, the deportation panel operates unbound by the restrictions and responsibilities placed on the regular parole process. A parole board is normally tasked with deciding whether prisoners are ready for release based on a number of factors including their behavior behind bars, efforts to rehabilitate, whether they pose a risk to the public and victims’ opinions.
During the August hearings, however, the board was not required to abide by the eligibility restrictions imposed by the Legislature last year, including the requirement that prisoners have clean disciplinary records for at least three years and low-risk scores as determined by an algorithm.
“Parole granted for the purpose of deportation is fundamentally different from discretionary parole granted to individuals who have demonstrated readiness for community supervision,” Francis Abbott, executive director of the parole board, told Verite News and ProPublica. “In these cases, the individuals are present in the United States unlawfully and have been convicted of criminal offenses.”
To be eligible to appear before the new panel, prisoners must have a federal deportation notice and not have been convicted of a sex offense or a violent crime that carries a sentence of more than 10 years. (Louisiana law does not consider negligent homicide to be a violent crime.)
Christopher Walters, deputy executive counsel with the Landry administration, said at a May legislative hearing that the state has identified about 390 prisoners who might be eligible to be paroled and deported. The corrections department would not verify or update that number.
“It’s an ongoing process to determine eligibility for this specific legislation,” Derrick Ellis, the department’s deputy secretary, said in a recent interview.
There are no more hearings scheduled for the remainder of the year, according to the parole board.
Unlike typical parolees, who are required to check in regularly with their parole officers and prohibited from unauthorized travel, those paroled to be deported are not placed under any supervision. Once deported, they are released with one stipulation: Do not return to the United States.
Louisiana law says those who do return will be forced to serve the remainder of their sentences. But that may not be enough of a deterrent. Margaret Hay, first assistant district attorney with the Jefferson Parish District Attorney’s Office, which prosecuted one of the deported men, said prosecutors are concerned parolees convicted of violent crimes “may, very quickly, just be right back in this country.”
“There’s no guarantee that our border will remain as secure as I believe that it might be right now,” said Hay, who nevertheless said she supports the initiative.
ProPublica and Verite News contacted the embassies and consulates for Mexico, Nicaragua, Honduras and Vietnam to learn how those countries manage the repatriation of deportees whose U.S. prison sentences were cut short. None responded to multiple phone calls and emails.
Another issue at play is that Louisiana law requires the parole committee to notify victims about upcoming parole hearings, provided they are registered with the Louisiana Victim Outreach Program, a state initiative that provides support services. Many victims of crime, especially those who are undocumented, fail to register or are aware of the state program. The parole board said there were no registered victims in the nine cases that appeared before the deportation panel in August.
Several local prosecutors said they tried reaching the families of the six victims who had been killed by four of the paroled men, three of whom were charged with vehicular homicide, but had trouble making contact. ProPublica and Verite News could not reach any of the victims or family members of deceased victims in the cases involving the nine men.
Landry, a Trump ally, has long been an immigration hard-liner. During his eight years as attorney general, which began a year before Trump’s first term as president, Louisiana’s capacity for detaining immigrants expanded from two facilities in 2016 to eight. That positioned the state to become a key partner in Trump’s mass deportation agenda during his second presidency.

In September, Landry and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unveiled a ninth immigration detention facility, known as the Louisiana Lockup, located in the former solitary confinement wing of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. That is where Hoang Huy Pham, one of the nine men paroled in August, is being held as he awaits deportation to Vietnam, the country his family said he fled as a child refugee during the Vietnam War.
Pham’s daughter Theresa, who asked to be referred to by only her first name because she works for the federal government and fears retaliation, said her father called her in June to tell her he was going to be paroled at the end of August after spending 20 years in prison for a long history of car theft. He told her he would live in a halfway house before rejoining the family in Baton Rouge, Theresa recalled. She said her elderly grandfather — Pham’s father — was looking forward to him finally getting out of prison to help with his care.
Then in September, Theresa received another call from her father. This time, he told her he had been transferred to Angola to await deportation. That five-minute call was the last time Theresa said she heard from him.
“You finally got out, but you’re going somewhere else where you’re not supposed to be,” Theresa said. “It’s a false hope.”
Hervin Pineda was the only prisoner to tell the parole board in August that he wanted to be deported back home. He wished to return to Nicaragua to be with his ailing, elderly mother in her final days, he told the board through an interpreter.
Pineda, who had previously been deported while on probation, had served less than a year of a seven-year sentence on charges of cocaine possession.
Nevertheless, the board granted his request.
“You’re a serious dope dealer,” Prator, the panel chair, told him. “We don’t want you back.”
ICE took him into federal custody that day and deported him to Nicaragua on Sept. 12.

Newark Charter defeated Brandywine, 35-0, Friday: The Patriots scored two defensive touchdowns in the first half and added three rushing scores in the second half to punch their ticket to the class 1A state championship game in their first varsity season. Running back Austin Gbadegbe accumulated over 100 rushing yards and two scores in the win. Ajay Bonis scored the Patriots’ other offensive touchdown.  
Seaford defeated McKean, 41-0, Saturday: Seaford will play Newark Charter for the second time this season in the class 1A state championship game after defeating McKean in the semi-finals. Seaford scored six offensive touchdowns in the game, three of which from senior Brendan West. Seaford’s defense earned its fourth shutout of the season and has yet to give up a single point in the postseason. In the last meeting between the Patriots and Blue Jays, Seaford held the Patriots to just seven points. 
2A
Indian River defeated Lake Forest in overtime, 14-7, Friday: Indian River kept its undefeated season going, winning in overtime against the Spartans to advance to the class 2A championship game in their first year in the division. The Indians fell behind in the second quarter following an Andrew White score for the Spartans. In the fourth quarter, Indian River quarterback Dylan Grise connected with Michael Peranteau tying the game. Darnell Stokes ran the ball for a touchdown in the overtime period providing Indian River with the game winning score.
Red Lion defeated Howard in overtime, 41-40, Saturday: Red Lion pulled off a spectacular upset against the previously undefeated Howard Wildcats to earn its spot in the class 2A championship game. Red Lion Quarterback Evan Budinger threw four touchdowns helping the program reach its first 2A championship game since the expansion to three divisions in 2021.

One of the most visible and prolific voices for progressive policy change in 21st Century North Carolina is UNC Professor of Law Gene Nichol. Since taking up residence here three decades ago, Prof. Nichol has taught, written and advocated with remarkable energy and clarity for public policies that promote economic, social and political justice. He established a center at UNC that worked to document and combat poverty and inequality, and he’s long served as one of the state’s toughest and most unapologetic public critics of the conservative politicians who’ve dominated state policymaking in the last 15 years.
Now, Nichol is out with a new book in which he documents the relentless right-wing political and policy crusade that’s being waged by the state’s conservative legislature leadership and speaks directly to caring and thinking North Carolinians about how they can fight back. The book, which is published by the folks at Blair Publishing, is entitled “Now what?

The Detroit school district began offering yellow bus service to students at two high schools this year in an effort to improve attendance. But three months into the school year, few students are hopping on the buses.
At the start of the year, about five high schoolers were riding each of the eight buses in the pilot program, despite efforts by the Detroit Public Schools Community District to notify students and families of the new option, officials said during a community meeting this month. On average, 15 students now ride on each bus every day.
The district is investigating ways to increase ridership, Machion Jackson, a deputy superintendent overseeing transportation, said during the meeting. Colder weather in the coming months and potential adjustments to bus stops draw more students, she said.
“We have significantly increased ridership, and we’re hoping to (continue) to do so,” she said.
DPSCD officials did not respond to requests about the cost of bus pilot or answer questions related to the program.
The pilot program began as an experiment to improve attendance at two schools with high rates of chronic absenteeism. Officials chose Henry Ford High School and East English Village Preparatory Academy at Finney, which had absence rates of 82% and 77% respectively in the 2024-25 school year.
The district’s overall rate was 60.9%.
Students are considered to be chronically absent if they miss 10% or more of days in a school year.
Currently, the district does not provide yellow bus service to most high school students. Exceptions are made in some cases, including for students with disabilities and those experiencing homelessness. Around 1,400 high schoolers rode yellow buses so far this school year, according to numbers presented at the community meeting.
City buses are the main mode of transportation for most Detroit high schoolers. So far this school year, more than 3,780 high schoolers got free city bus passes from DPSCD.
Small vehicle transportation, passenger van rides, and gas card reimbursements from the district also help get kids to school.
 Why aren’t more students riding yellow buses?

Both Henry Ford and East English enrolled more than 600 students in 2024-25, meaning an average of around 10% of students at each school are riding the pilot buses each day.
Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said at a board meeting last month the pilot is “not having a scaled impact” on chronic absenteeism at either school. There may be a positive effect on attendance for individual students, he added.
The district has offered student incentives to boost ridership on the pilot buses.
The pilot is plugged during daily announcements in the schools, through lunchtime engagement sessions, and robocalls to parents.
The four pilot buses make between 35 and 42 stops on their routes, Jackson said.
“We chose the stops based on kind of like a heat map,” she said. “We looked at the density of where the majority of the students who attend those schools live in a neighborhood feeder pattern where they lived, and we strategically placed stops so that those students would not have to walk far.”
Anthony Peete, a student representative on the board who attends Henry Ford, said last month that his classmates don’t find the yellow buses convenient.
Some students said they had to walk farther to the yellow bus stop than for the city bus. Others didn’t know how to check where the bus route went, he said.
Vitti said the district should look at ridership numbers again in January and consider whether the pilot should continue.
The district could expand transportation services with additional state funding that was not anticipated in the district’s adopted budget, Vitti said, adding that he would recommend paying for ride shares for small groups of students rather than adding more yellow buses.
The district allocated more than $57.2 million for transportation in its budget for 2025-26 – an increase of nearly $5 million compared to the year before.

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the agency would roll out a relief plan for the country’s agriculture sector in December, offering potential good news in a year of uncertainty for Kansans.
Secretary Brooke Rollins did not give details about the plan but indicated the USDA has been analyzing and building a “formula” around the current situation, Bloomberg News reported. 
That situation includes the effects of tariffs and trade policy, the lack of a farm bill and the high cost of inputs, factors that are making it difficult for Kansas farmers and ranchers to plan for the future.



Crop farmers and cattle ranchers in the Sunflower State have shared vastly different experiences this year, according to a Kansas State University professor and economist.
Across the board, the agriculture industry has experienced general inflationary pressures on production expenses, said Jennifer Ifft, Kansas State University extension specialist on agricultural policy.
“But once you get beyond that, I think this year, more than ever, you really have to look at crops and livestock separately,” she said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “The beef cattle prices are high, historic highs for the cow/calf side. They’re finally making money after some pretty long rough spells.”
However, crop farmers are seeing low prices and high expenses, Ifft said, along with weather pressures.
Kansas’ net farm income looks good, a measure that Ifft likens to the gross domestic product because it incorporates revenues and expenses from crops and livestock. 
The Fall 2025 Farm Income Outlook for Kansas, a study completed by Kansas State University and the University of Missouri, shows an 88% increase in Kansas net farm income in 2025, while it also projects a slight decrease in 2026.
Net farm income swings quite a bit, going down to $2 billion and up to $9 or $10 billion, Ifft said.
The 88% increase this year can be tied to strong beef cattle prices and also to government payments made in 2025 but attributable to 2023 and 2024, she said.
“Those payments for 2025 are mostly disaster payments, either for low profitability for crop farms or disaster payments, and those cover losses from 2023 and 2024,” she said. “You can see much smoother income if you assign those payments into the year that loss was incurred.”
However, that’s not the way net farm income is measured, she said. The value of determining net farm income is that it always incorporates the same factors, giving a measurement that is easily comparable year over year.
Projections for decreased net farm income in 2026 are tied in part to uncertainty about government payments, Ifft said.
“Government payments are projected to come down,” she said. “We don’t guess about programs that we don’t know about. It’s only about what we know about today.”
Kansas crop receipts are projected to rise by about 8%, or $559.18 million in 2025, with increases expected across all the major commodities despite lower prices, the report said.
“This is because yields are estimated to recover from recent lows as the state recovers from persistent drought,” the report said.
Cash receipts for cattle and calves are expected to be up 24%, or $3.54 billion for a total of $18.33 billion in 2025, the report said.
Overall, the state is projected to see total crop and livestock receipts and government payments increase $6.52 billion in 2025, of which livestock and crop receipts account for 58% and 9% of the change, respectively, the report said.
As farmers plan for the upcoming year, policy uncertainty challenges them to make decisions, and many would like to see the farm bill move ahead.
Although Ifft calls farmers and ranchers the best risk managers around, failure to pass a long-term — typically five years — farm bill makes it difficult to plan. Crop insurance and other programs they depend on are included in the farm bill, she said, whereas ad hoc payments, such as for disasters, are part of the farm safety net and aren’t something that can be incorporated into farm planning.
She gave an example of a crop producer, making decisions in mid-November for the upcoming year. Many have already paid for some of their inputs, such as seed, for the coming year.
“If you pay early, either in cash or through early financing, you can usually get a lower price. It’s a farm management strategy,” she said. “Let’s say your crop producer margins are tight this year, but that there’s some advantage to prepay. You have to work with your lender.”
But the federal government has been talking about $12 to $15 billion of trade aid for crop producers, which could help pay for those inputs.
“You have to make this risk management decision, which, again, it’s very personal, no right or wrong,” Ifft said. “Do you ignore that you could be getting a substantial payment, maybe in a month, maybe in six months, and make that decision, or do you hold on, wait?”
Ifft and her K-State colleagues offered a webinar this year about farm management in the era of ad hoc payments, how to take into account these uncertain payments and how to use them to better position your operation in the coming years, she said.
Ifft said K-State is offering agricultural profitability workshops throughout the state, in collaboration with commodity organizations and others. The workshops are for producers and focus on the difficulties of “tighter margins and tougher decisions.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stockyard-Dodge-City-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 10:58:57.344193

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Laura Gunderson, president of the Child Care Providers Coalition of Kansas, says the state’s child care system is broken and providers need more support. 
With the creation of a new child care law, advocates are now grappling with a system that will streamline departments into the Office of Early Childhood while also loosening regulations for child care providers. 
The Legislature passed House Bill 2045 earlier this year, changing regulations for child care providers at both home day cares and child care centers. Now, an unlicensed individual can provide care for up to four children for up to 35 hours per week, in addition to their own children. Before, an unlicensed provider could only care for two children for 20 hours per week.
“We are home educators. We understand that quality care can look multiple ways,” Gunderson said. “ However, with unlicensed care, our concerns are that there’s no background checks. There is no CPR or first aid being required. With these little ones, CPR and first aid should be basic.”
The Office of Early Childhood was created to streamline various services, including some from the Department of Health and Environment and the Department for Children and Families, with the office set to be operational by June 2026. 
The goal is to make the child care process easier for parents with nearly every resource in one place, said Christi Smith, executive director of Child Care Aware Kansas. 
“We are a huge supporter of the Office of Early Childhood,” Smith said. “I think it will be a game changer for the system. It’s been a long time coming.”
However, Kansas Action for Children released a statement earlier this year about the bill, emphasizing “last minute” provisions that could jeopardize child safety. 
“The possibility of harm to children from the last-minute additions that reduce the quality of care may outweigh the good Kansans see in the long term,” the statement said. “The child care community was unable to weigh in and advise on the risks to children if it became law.”
The 2025 Kansas Speaks survey, published by Fort Hayes State University in October, revealed that 91.4% of respondents say affordable, quality child care is important for families regardless of having children of their own. 
Gunderson and the Child Care Providers Coalition of Kansas were vocal against Gov. Laura Kelly’s concessions to achieve creating the new office. With reduced provider regulations, Gunderson said, the state isn’t moving toward the quality families need.
“ When you’re caring for someone else’s child, their safety is the utmost importance. We are home educators. We’ve put so much time into our environments and preparation for these kids,” Gunderson said. “There’s so much into it. And to have someone unlicensed, able to essentially do similar work, it made us all kind of feel like what are we putting so many hours in for?”
For rural Kansas, finding any child care at all can be a challenge. Smith said she approves of the bill because it can allow providers to care for children without a license, which was intended to help reduce barriers for potential providers in small communities.
“It’s not always about a person not wanting to be a licensed child care provider. They may not truly have the ability to be,” Smith said. “For a small community that has zero options, that may have been the only option.”
Smith said parents should look at it from both perspectives to choose what’s right for their family, whether that’s licensed or unlicensed care.
“It wasn’t designed to be one wrong over the other. I’ve never heard a legislator tell me we don’t care about the health and safety of infants and toddlers,” Smith said. 
New child care legislation means this is a critical time for parents to do their research when looking for child care, said Emily Barnes, education policy adviser for Kansas Action for Children. 
“It’s important to focus on educating parents about what they need to be aware of so that they can ask the right questions,” Barnes said. “Educating parents and the general public that when you have a licensed provider, you’re more likely to have a situation where health and safety standards are being followed.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9760-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 10:58:57.344193

Sharing personal journeys takes courage, and we appreciate the effort and energy devoted to telling these VSAC stories.
In the spirit of the season, we’re sharing a selection of excerpts from some of these profiles. The experiences of these four Vermonters represent just a small sample of our Spotlight features. Together, these stories highlight the community of support that helped each student pursue educational and career goals.
“I know my dad is talking about me finishing my school and that pushes me a lot.”
When Pascaline Furaha was about to enroll in Early College at the start of her senior year at Winooski High School, she knew the college work would be a challenge. But she also believed she could do it. “I’ve watched other people who came from Africa before me go on to earn degrees. I can also be the one to keep going and go that far.”
Pascaline was born in a refugee camp in Burundi and arrived in Vermont in 2019, at the age of 12. She spoke Swahili and a little Kurundi. Learning English was challenging, but she persisted and is now multilingual. 
In the ninth grade, she began VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program with VSAC Outreach Counselor Stevya Mukuzo. GEAR UP offers support to students who wish to continue their education after high school by providing financial assistance, scholarships, and college and career counseling.
Having watched her two older brothers struggle with the transition from high school to college, Pascaline took a different path to help build more resilience. VSAC introduced her to the Early College program at Community College of Vermont (CCV), and Pascaline was all in.
“I went for Early College because I didn’t want to jump right into university. I wanted to learn more about college first,” she explains. “I made the best decision. I’m now confident I can go to college and be ready for it, because I’ve already experienced it.”
Pascaline will complete her associate’s degree at CCV this year and plans to apply to school so that she may continue, and earn her bachelor’s. 
While she’s had to work hard in school, she’s felt a wealth of support, from her teachers to her VSAC counselor, to leaders of her family and her faith. Her father’s pride has been a major source of encouragement. “I know my dad is talking about me, continuing my school, and that pushes me a lot,” says Pascaline.
“I couldn’t have done this alone.”
Jeff Isabelle of Barre has been fascinated with paleontology—the study of dinosaurs—for as long as he can remember. While his lifetime hobby connects him to the earth’s distant past, Jeff has also kept his focus strongly on the future throughout his time at Spaulding High School in Barre. Hoping he could go on to college, he worked hard to keep up his grades. He also participated in the VSAC TRIO Talent Search program, an initiative to help students from modest-income backgrounds apply to and pay for college. 
Jeff was accepted to the geology program at Norwich University. By March of his senior year at Spaulding, Jeff had earned enough scholarship awards to cover two-thirds of his college costs. Then, in mid-April, he learned he had won the prestigious Ronald York Scholarship from Spaulding, which further reduced his annual expenses.
Jeff’s hard work is a big part of the story, but he gives a lot of credit to his VSAC counselor, Chelsea Martin, for pushing him to apply for so many opportunities, and to his family for helping him out so much with all the forms. “I couldn’t have done this alone,” he said.
“Receiving the VSAC Advancement Grant was so helpful for me, and it’s also been a huge step forward in making drivers’ ed more accessible to people.”
Earning your driver’s license is an American rite of passage. Aden Haji, founder of Haji Driving Academy, is building his business on helping newly arrived people earn those licenses, bringing them one step closer to merging into American culture.
Haji Driving Academy specializes in working with diverse populations whose cultural and linguistic needs are often overlooked in driver’s education. One obstacle is the language barrier, which Aden understands firsthand. He can communicate with his clients in his additional languages—including Somali—and his experience as a one-time newly arrived person, himself, often sets clients at ease. 
But Aden had to jump through a few hoops of his own to open Haji Driving Academy. He already had a degree in anthropology from the University of Vermont when he started researching what it would take to open a driving school, and he was surprised to learn how much training was required. He ended up accomplishing his dream to open his own education organization with the help of VSAC.
“There are courses I had to take in order to become certified,” Aden explains. Thanks to financial support from VSAC’s Advancement Grant—which supports adult students by funding short-term training opportunities that lead to job or career growth—Aden was able to complete those courses faster than he might have otherwise, had he financed the tuition entirely on his own.  
“Receiving the VSAC Advancement Grant was so helpful for me, and it’s also been a huge step forward in making drivers’ ed more accessible to people who need that support,” says Aden, adding that, in a full-circle moment, several of his students have also received funding for his driving course under the same grant program.
“VSAC saw through me when I couldn’t see anything for myself. And I’m really, really, glad they did.”
Julia Gosselin is a self-proclaimed “outdoors kind of kid.” What was true in her childhood stuck with her through college and beyond, and in 2022, she graduated from Castleton University (now Vermont State University Castleton) with a degree in Wildlife and Forest Conservation. Today, at 27, she’s staying connected to conservation through seasonal trail work with Audubon Vermont and landscaping jobs that support wildlife, while she works at one of Vermont’s only emergency veterinary clinics.
Julia was part of VSAC’s Talent Search program. And Julia’s VSAC Outreach Counselor, Monda Kelley, saw her enormous potential.
“She pushed me,” Julia says. “I tried to push her away, and she came back. She reminded me of who I used to be, this kid who loved being outside and in the trees, and who loved nature. Monda showed me that I could turn that love into a career and she showed me how to do it. Without her, honestly I don’t know if I would have gone to college.”
“VSAC helped me open doors,” she says. “They saw through me when I couldn’t see anything for myself. I’m really, really glad they did. And, Monda’s been my reference on every job I’ve had. Even when I didn’t want to listen to her, she kept nudging me forward.”
Now, armed with a college degree and a strong support network, Julia is looking ahead. Her dream job? Working with Vermonters to design gardens, lawns, and landscapes that support pollinators and wildlife, perhaps with a focus on forestry and conservation. 
The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency. We advocate for Vermont students and their families to ensure that they have the tools they need to achieve their education and training goals. We create opportunities for all Vermont students, but particularly for those—of any age—who believe that the doors to education are closed to them.

Delaware is elevating its statewide strategy to protect farms, forests, and rural communities from the effects of climate change, with new funding streams, expanded cost-share programs, and a series of innovative projects rolling out over the next year.
Jimmy Kroon, Chief of Planning with the Delaware Department of Agriculture, says these initiatives signal a major step forward. “We’re increasing support for the practices that have the greatest impact on resilience—cover crops, no-till, precision agriculture, clean energy, and land preservation,” he said. “These investments are bigger and more targeted than anything we’ve done previously.”
Forestry Programs Grow: A New Focus on Resiliency
State Forester Kyle Hoyd said the Delaware Forest Service is introducing several new efforts, with the goal of strengthening forests and protecting communities from climate-related threats like storms, heat, and pests.
One of the most notable additions is the Forest Resiliency Fund. This $1.5 million cost-share program for private landowners will be available over the next three years. Hoyd explains it is specifically created to support forests with adapting to future conditions.
The state is also increasing technical assistance for afforestation and reforestation, boosting prescribed fire programming, and enhancing educational outreach to encourage participation from landowners.
Urban communities will receive further support as well, including new street and park tree plantings to combat heat islands and flooding. Hoyd said the Forest Service is “diversifying forest resources on state-owned lands to account for future climates and serve as the showcase for private landowners.”
Other forestry initiatives include:


Added forest protections and mitigation banking during land-use changes


New tools to help all 57 Delaware municipalities better plan and fund tree projects


Expanded cross-agency collaboration with developers, planners, and local governments


Increased monitoring for insect and disease outbreaks linked to changing climate patterns


Cover Crops, Carbon Sequestration, and Innovative Research
The state’s largest investment remains in climate-smart crop strategies—especially cover crops, which minimize runoff, stop  soil erosion, and store carbon.
Kroon said Delaware is significantly expanding this level of support. “We increased our funding request to $10 million for FY27,” he noted. The department is also backing research into innovative cover crop practices and boosting adoption of no-till and low-till farming.
Although cover crop cost-share is funded by the Department of Agriculture, it’s implemented locally. “Those interested should contact their conservation district,” Kroon said.

Lowering Emissions on Chicken Farms
As one of the state’s largest industries, Delaware’s poultry sector will see more help reducing energy use and emissions.
Specifically, Kroon emphasized new efforts to transition to alternative energy sources, made possible through partnerships with organizations like Energize Delaware.
Farmers are encouraged to seek energy audits and farm-specific programs through Energize Delaware to find opportunities for cost-effective upgrades.
Precision Agriculture: Doing More With Less
Another major focus for Delaware is precision agriculture—leveraging technology to minimize fertilizer, fuel, and water use while improving yields.
Kroon said the state is supporting improvements in this area through “research, demonstration projects, and workforce development.” Precision agriculture tools can go a long way in helping farms reduce emissions, lower energy costs, and minimize nutrient runoff into waterways.
Protecting Farmland From Development Pressures
The state is also aiming to preserve more farmland, particularly with development pushing into rural areas.
Kroon said the department is working closely with the Office of Statewide Planning to promote smart-growth strategies and prevent low-density sprawl. He pointed to research from American Farmland Trust, indicating that rural residential development produces emissions significantly higher than farmland or dense urban areas.
Plus, he added that preserved farmland offers long-term climate benefits. “Owners of preserved farmland are also more likely to implement further conservation practices,” Kroon said.
More information on the state’s preservation program can be found via the Delaware Department of Agriculture.
Preparing for Future Climate Risks
Delaware farmers are currently dealing with frequent flooding, hotter summers, intense rainfall, and shifting pest pressures. These new programs were designed with those challenges top-of-mind.
The expanded initiatives, Kroon said, are created to equip farms with the right tools to stay productive long-term. From resilient forests to carbon-sequestering croplands, each investment is part of a larger statewide strategy.
How Farmers and Landowners Can Get Involved
Farmers and landowners can stay up-to-date through several channels:


Cover crop and soil health programs: Contact local conservation districts.


Energy efficiency and alternative energy for poultry farms: Reach out to Energize Delaware.


Forestry cost-share, tree planting, or community forestry programs: Contact the Delaware Forest Service.


Land preservation opportunities: Visit the state’s agricultural land preservation program website.


A Statewide Effort
Kroon said Delaware’s approach reflects close cooperation across agencies, sectors, and local governments. “We’re supporting practices that reduce emissions, build resilience, and keep Delaware agriculture strong,” he said.
Hoyd agreed, pointing out that the forestry component is designed not only to protect forests, but to serve as a model for climate-ready landscapes throughout the state.
Together, the programs represent one of Delaware’s most comprehensive climate-resilience investments to date, positioning the state as a leader in climate-smart agriculture.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/corn-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 10:58:57.344193

(Contributed photo).The younger children of Mohammad Ali Dadfar believe their father is away, working. That’s what they’ve been told.
Only the oldest, an 11-year-old girl, and Dadfar’s wife know the truth.

The father of four, an immigrant from Afghanistan who helped the U.S. military fight the Taliban, is in a Springfield, Missouri, jail — held with other immigrants picked up in nationwide sweeps.
Dadfar is 37 and an asylum-seeker with work authorization and a job as an over-the-road trucker.
He’s been held in the Greene County Jail since early October and fears being sent back to Afghanistan.
“They feel the lack of their father now,” said Dadfar’s wife, speaking with the help of a translation app. “And every time their question is, ‘When will father come home?’“
The Beacon is not naming her due to privacy concerns for the minor children.
A Kansas City-based immigration attorney has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Dadfar’s warrantless arrest and detention as unlawful.
Dadfar’s case is among a spate of federal lawsuits contesting warrantless arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and is part of continued legal attempts to hold the Trump administration accountable to a 2022 consent decree.
The Department of Homeland Security can arrest people without a warrant, but only in limited circumstances, such as when there is a fear that the person will escape before a warrant can be obtained.
Dadfar, the lawsuit argues, was not a flight risk.
Dadfar is represented by Rekha Sharma-Crawford in the case, which alleges that his detention is a violation of the 2022 Castañon Nava federal consent decree.
Dadfar’s case was filed Oct. 12 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.
Named as defendants in the complaint are Greene County Sheriff Jim C. Arnott, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and ICE’s Chicago Field Office Director Samuel Olson.
The Greene County sheriff’s office was not aware of the filing and declined to comment further.
The Department of Homeland Security did not reply to a request for comment.
The Trump administration says it wants to remove dangerous immigrant criminals from the country, what officials often call “the worst of the worst.”
But 97% of the more than 600 undocumented immigrants arrested during the recent Operation Midway Blitz around Chicago had no criminal record, according to reporting by NPR, citing the Department of Homeland Security’s records submitted in ongoing cases involving the consent decree.
The lawsuit also asks that Dadfar not be transferred out of the jurisdiction of ICE’s Kansas City field office.
“Despite over 100 courts having determined that the government’s interpretation of law is incorrect, and the government not appealing those cases, people continue to be unlawfully denied due process and denied their freedom,” Sharma-Crawford said. “It’s un-American.”
 Fighting the Taliban

Dadfar is among thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. military during the 20-year war in Afghanistan, the longest war in U.S. history.
The U.S. entered Afghanistan in retaliation after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Afghans helped as part of the Afghan military, as translators, drivers and intelligence operatives and helped with logistics and understanding the country’s culture.
Dadfar, his wife said, was a security officer with the Afghan military and moved around the country with U.S. troops.
Ultimately, the U.S. and allied efforts failed and the Taliban retook the capital of Kabul in 2021.
Dadfar was left behind in the highly criticized, chaotic final withdrawal of U.S. troops under the Biden administration.
Because he had helped the U.S. military, Dadfar was targeted by the Taliban, his wife said.
Subsequent years were treacherous for Dadfar, his wife and their children, who are all under the age of 12.
Their journey to the U.S. took three years, with stays in Iran and Brazil.
A toddler daughter nearly drowned as the family crossed the roadless jungle of the Darien Gap, a dangerous passage between Colombia and Panama.
In June 2024, Dadfar and his family made it to the U.S. southern border. They had an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, made through an app set up by the Department of Homeland Security.
At the border, they began the process to apply for asylum.
Dadfar was released on a parole that is valid until June 17, 2026.
Dadfar’s work permit is also valid through June 17, 2026, according to the lawsuit.
 Operations Guardian and Midway Blitz

Dadfar’s Oct. 10 arrest at an Indiana weigh station came just three days after ICE had been found in violation of the original consent decree.
He was stopped there as part of his route as a commercial driver.
On Oct. 7, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, ruled in favor of a group of immigrant workers, including 11 employees who had been apprehended during a raid at a Mexican restaurant in Liberty earlier this year.
The Liberty workers were already out on bond. But their cases were part of a class action challenge to how ICE is operating under the Trump administration.
The judge also agreed that immigration officials were concocting details for warrants after they had made arrests, rather than having the necessary warrants ahead of actions.
The 2022 consent decree is named for one of the original plaintiffs, Margarito Castañon-Nava, and covers six states — Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Kentucky.
Additional rulings by the same judge have ordered the government to release more than 400 immigrants it is holding under warrantless arrests or probable cause, placing the detainees on monitoring programs.
A stay on the order was issued by an appeals court on Nov. 20, and a hearing will be held in early December.
Dadfar might have come under scrutiny through Operation Guardian, an effort by ICE to target undocumented immigrants working as truckers.
A trucker from Uzbekistan, accused in his native country of being a member of a terrorist organization, was arrested Nov. 17 as he drove in Kansas, according to DHS. The man was living in Pennsylvania.
Operation Midway Blitz targeted immigrants in the Chicago area, an effort that coincided with Dadfar’s detainment.
Indiana State Police held Dadfar for five hours without providing a reason or a warrant, according to the lawsuit.
He then was sent to Chicago and held by ICE officials there for two days, again without reason, the suit said.

DHS paperwork filed with the lawsuit said Dadfar was detained without bond and would be held in ICE custody pending his immigration proceedings.
His next hearing before an Denver immigration judge on the asylum application is Feb. 3, 2026.
The lawsuit alleges: “Mr. Dadfar was present … under his valid grant of parole, and there existed no justification for his detention or arrest during a routine matter. He was paroled into the U.S. for the purpose of seeking asylum, which he did timely. He was awaiting his court hearing and was not a flight risk.”
Sharma-Crawford said that she had spoken with Dadfar by phone.
He is represented in his asylum case by a Colorado immigration law firm.
The Missouri suit also questions Homeland Security paperwork that states Dadfar denied having a fear of being deported to Afghanistan.
But Dadfar was never asked by immigration officials about his fear of returning to Afghanistan, Sharma-Crawford said.
Attempts to help Afghans who were left stranded after the U.S. withdrawal are ongoing and increasingly difficult.
Thousands have a claim that they aided our military. And some were separated from their families as they tried to board planes after Kabul fell to the Taliban.
President Donald Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program shortly after taking office, leaving immigrants who had already been approved for travel without a route to enter the U.S. And the State Department suspended funding to help resettle Afghan refugees already in the U.S.
Dadfar’s wife said she is grateful and prayerful for the many people who have stepped forward to help her family resettle and, now, to challenge her husband’s detention.
But as time passes, the family’s distress builds.
“Every time Ali calls, he tells them (the younger children) that he is at work and that he is trying to finish work as soon as possible and return home,” she said.

Charlie Baker, talks with CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas about the yearlong series of essays he wrote for CommonWealth Beacon on the need for civil discussion of often controversial issues in an era of polarized debate.","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Michael Jonas
GUESTS: Jim Peyser







POLITICAL DEBATE THESE days looks more often like trench warfare than reasoned discourse on the pros and cons of important policy proposals. In our age of hyper-polarization, political adversaries are treated more like blood enemies, and issues are often characterized in absolute terms as black-and-white matters of right and wrong, even when they’re often far more complicated than that.  
Jim Peyser says a healthy, well-functioning democracy depends on us getting out of this cycle of vitriol and restoring a measure of civil discourse to our debates. His day job for all eight years of Charlie Baker’s tenure as governor was secretary of education. But Peyser, whose dad was a congressman from New York in the 1970s and early 1980s – and showed serious bipartisanship by switching parties during that time, from Republican to Democrat – has a deep interest in civic life and in finding ways to bridge some of the divide that has turned political debate into winner-take-all blood sport.  
“We’re essentially shouting at each other across the divide,” says Peyser, who joined CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas this week on The Codcast. Our positions on issues have been reduced to bumper sticker slogans, he said, “which is essentially crowding out or making it impossible to have an actual conversation around the issues themselves, the problems we’re trying to solve, and what some of the solutions might be.” 
Over the past year, Peyser has written a dozen issue briefs for CommonWealth Beacon in which he tries to show just what he means – taking on contentious issues facing the state that range from rent control to natural gas pipelines and proposals for a prison construction moratorium. He shows how arguments often come down to balancing trade-offs rather than the moralistic right-or-wrong framing used by those pushing each side most vehemently. (Read Peyser’s concluding essay here, which has links at the end to all 12 issue briefs as well as the two essays he wrote to launch the series that described the polarized state we are in – and how we might begin to chart a course out of it.)  
As to whether Donald Trump is the cause or consequence of our poisoned polity, Peyser says “both.”  
“He’s an accelerant. But he didn’t come from nowhere,” Peyser says, dating the coming apart to at least the 1990s. 
Peyser says we are in a more polarized time. But he also agrees with the arguments being made that the center of political gravity nonetheless is in, well, in the center. (A recent New York Times editorial made that case, as does a national report issued last month by a center-left group of Democrats, co-authored by Massachusetts activist Liam Kerr.)  
“I do think that the large majority of people are closer to one another than they think,” Peyser says, “and that the extent to which they can’t talk to each other or see each other or see the other side as the enemy – it has to do with some assumptions that are made about who’s saying what and what underlies their positions as opposed to actual engagement in a particular subject on a particular topic.” 
Voters’ view on a particular statement, for example, will be different if they are told it was said by Trump or by Joe Biden, Peyser notes.  
As for what it will take to shift the political discourse toward a healthier give and take, “I don’t think there’s a quick fix or silver bullet,” Peyser says. He thinks there are some “structural reforms” that might help. “I am intrigued by the idea of open primaries as a way of limiting the impact of the extremes of either party in terms of driving the candidates that the general election tends to ultimately get to choose from,” he says. (Open primaries are the subject of one of the ballot questions being proposed for the 2026 Massachusetts election.)  
“By the same token,” Peyser says, “I think it’s a cultural shift that’s just going to have to happen over time. There’s some efforts underway to try to stimulate some of that, some discussions across difference and across party lines. And those are all good. They’re all small-scale now and hopefully they’ll get bigger and have bigger impact. But I think, in some ways, it’s unfortunately hard to see a path through this other than sort of the day-to-day slog of trying to be more reasonable, both in terms of how we talk about issues, but, importantly, how we talk to and relate to one another.” 
During the episode, Jonas and Peyser discuss how robust debate can take a turn for the toxic (3:00), the genesis of Peyser’s series on bridging divides (11:30), and how so many voters seemed to hit “burn it down” on both sides of the aisle (23:30).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-24 10:58:57.344193

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)As the Trump administration carries out what many observers say are illegal military strikes against vessels in the Caribbean allegedly smuggling drugs, six Democratic members of Congress issued a video on Nov. 18, 2025, telling the military “You can refuse illegal orders” and “You must refuse illegal orders.”
The lawmakers have all served either in the military or the intelligence community. Their message sparked a furious response on social media from President Donald Trump, who called the legislators’ action “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”
One of the lawmakers, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, told The New York Times that she had heard from troops currently serving that they were worried about their own liability in actions such as the ones in the Caribbean.
This is not the first time Trump has put members of the military in situations whose legality has been questioned. But a large percentage of service members understand their duty to follow the law in such a difficult moment.
We are scholars of international relations and international law. We conducted survey research at the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Human Security Lab and discovered that many service members do understand the distinction between legal and illegal orders, the duty to disobey certain orders, and when they should do so.
 The ethical dilemma

With his Aug. 11, 2025, announcement that he was sending the National Guard – along with federal law enforcement – into Washington, D.C. to fight crime, Trump edged U.S. troops closer to the kind of military-civilian confrontations that can cross ethical and legal lines.
Indeed, since Trump returned to office, many of his actions have alarmed international human rights observers. His administration has deported immigrants without due process, held detainees in inhumane conditions, threatened the forcible removal of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and deployed both the National Guard and federal military troops to Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, Chicago and other cities to quell largely peaceful protests or enforce immigration laws.
When a sitting commander in chief authorizes acts like these, which many assert are clear violations of the law, men and women in uniform face an ethical dilemma: How should they respond to an order they believe is illegal?
The question may already be affecting troop morale. “The moral injuries of this operation, I think, will be enduring,” a National Guard member who had been deployed to quell public unrest over immigration arrests in Los Angeles told The New York Times. “This is not what the military of our country was designed to do, at all.”
Troops who are ordered to do something illegal are put in a bind – so much so that some argue that troops themselves are harmed when given such orders. They are not trained in legal nuances, and they are conditioned to obey. Yet if they obey “manifestly unlawful” orders, they can be prosecuted. Some analysts fear that U.S. troops are ill-equipped to recognize this threshold.
 Compelled to disobey

U.S. service members take an oath to uphold the Constitution. In addition, under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the U.S. Manual for Courts-Martial, service members must obey lawful orders and disobey unlawful orders. Unlawful orders are those that clearly violate the U.S. Constitution, international human rights standards or the Geneva Conventions.
Service members who follow an illegal order can be held liable and court-martialed or subject to prosecution by international tribunals. Following orders from a superior is no defense.
Our poll, fielded between June 13 and June 30, 2025, shows that service members understand these rules. Of the 818 active-duty troops we surveyed, just 9% stated that they would “obey any order.” Only 9% “didn’t know,” and only 2% had “no comment.”
When asked to describe unlawful orders in their own words, about 25% of respondents wrote about their duty to disobey orders that were “obviously wrong,” “obviously criminal” or “obviously unconstitutional.”
Another 8% spoke of immoral orders. One respondent wrote that “orders that clearly break international law, such as targeting non-combatants, are not just illegal — they’re immoral. As military personnel, we have a duty to uphold the law and refuse commands that betray that duty.”
Just over 40% of respondents listed specific examples of orders they would feel compelled to disobey.
The most common unprompted response, cited by 26% of those surveyed, was “harming civilians,” while another 15% of respondents gave a variety of other examples of violations of duty and law, such as “torturing prisoners” and “harming U.S. troops.”
One wrote that “an order would be obviously unlawful if it involved harming civilians, using torture, targeting people based on identity, or punishing others without legal process.”

 Soldiers, not lawyers

But the open-ended answers pointed to another struggle troops face: Some no longer trust U.S. law as useful guidance.
Writing in their own words about how they would know an illegal order when they saw it, more troops emphasized international law as a standard of illegality than emphasized U.S. law.
Others implied that acts that are illegal under international law might become legal in the U.S.
“Trump will issue illegal orders,” wrote one respondent. “The new laws will allow it,” wrote another. A third wrote, “We are not required to obey such laws.”
Several emphasized the U.S. political situation directly in their remarks, stating they’d disobey “oppression or harming U.S. civilians that clearly goes against the Constitution” or an order for “use of the military to carry out deportations.”
Still, the percentage of respondents who said they would disobey specific orders – such as torture – is lower than the percentage of respondents who recognized the responsibility to disobey in general.
This is not surprising: Troops are trained to obey and face numerous social, psychological and institutional pressures to do so. By contrast, most troops receive relatively little training in the laws of war or human rights law.
Political scientists have found, however, that having information on international law affects attitudes about the use of force among the general public. It can also affect decision-making by military personnel.
This finding was also borne out in our survey.
When we explicitly reminded troops that shooting civilians was a violation of international law, their willingness to disobey increased 8 percentage points.
 Drawing the line

As my research with another scholar showed in 2020, even thinking about law and morality can make a difference in opposition to certain war crimes.
The preliminary results from our survey led to a similar conclusion. Troops who answered questions on “manifestly unlawful orders” before they were asked questions on specific scenarios were much more likely to say they would refuse those specific illegal orders.
When asked if they would follow an order to drop a nuclear bomb on a civilian city, for example, 69% of troops who received that question first said they would obey the order.
But when the respondents were asked to think about and comment on the duty to disobey unlawful orders before being asked if they would follow the order to bomb, the percentage who would obey the order dropped 13 points to 56%.
While many troops said they might obey questionable orders, the large number who would not is remarkable.
Military culture makes disobedience difficult: Soldiers can be court-martialed for obeying an unlawful order, or for disobeying a lawful one.
Yet between one-third to half of the U.S. troops we surveyed would be willing to disobey if ordered to shoot or starve civilians, torture prisoners or drop a nuclear bomb on a city.
The service members described the methods they would use. Some would confront their superiors directly. Others imagined indirect methods: asking questions, creating diversions, going AWOL, “becoming violently ill.”
Criminologist Eva Whitehead researched actual cases of troop disobedience of illegal orders and found that when some troops disobey – even indirectly – others can more easily find the courage to do the same.
Whitehead’s research showed that those who refuse to follow illegal or immoral orders are most effective when they stand up for their actions openly.
The initial results of our survey – coupled with a recent spike in calls to the GI Rights Hotline – suggest American men and women in uniform don’t want to obey unlawful orders.
Some are standing up loudly. Many are thinking ahead to what they might do if confronted with unlawful orders. And those we surveyed are looking for guidance from the Constitution and international law to determine where they may have to draw that line.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-24 14:32:40+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,How incoming mayor Robert Van Campen will write Everett’s next chapter,Hallie Claflin,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/how-incoming-mayor-robert-van-campen-will-write-everetts-next-chapter/,"In a closely watched upset, City Councilor Robert Van Campen beat DeMaria by 9 percentage points. His promise to restore trust and accountability in City Hall wasn’t hard to sell. But Van Campen has a tough act to follow, despite DeMaria’s scandals.","IN FEBRUARY, Everett City Hall was thrown into the spotlight when the Massachusetts inspector general announced that longtime mayor Carlo DeMaria had been improperly paid $180,000 for “longevity” bonuses – payments he helped to draft and pass via city ordinance.  
The investigation found that DeMaria, who led the city for 17 years, intentionally hid the overpayments from Everett City Council, as well as the public. In March, the City Council passed a unanimous, symbolic vote of no confidence in DeMaria after he refused to pay the money back. DeMaria called the report a political attack and sued the state inspector general in August, shortly before an independent audit uncovered more improper spending. 
With annual longevity bonuses of $40,000 paid between 2018 and 2020, the Boston Globe reported that DeMaria had become Massachusetts’ highest-paid mayor, surpassing even the mayor of Boston’s salary.   
It wasn’t the first time DeMaria had been the subject of unflattering headlines. In 2022, then-US Attorney Rachael Rollins launched a federal investigation into multiple allegations of racism in Everett’s city government that was later dropped. In 2023, the superintendent and deputy superintendent of Everett Public Schools filed a lawsuit against the mayor, accusing him of racial and gender discrimination. 
Still, DeMaria declared he would seek reelection this year, claiming his work in Everett wasn’t finished. But on November 4, residents decided it was.  
In a closely watched upset, City Councilor Robert Van Campen beat DeMaria by 9 percentage points. His promise to restore trust and accountability in City Hall wasn’t hard to sell to residents who had grown tired of a mayor prone to lining his pockets, according to investigators. But Van Campen has a tough act to follow, despite DeMaria’s scandals.    
The defeated mayor presided over a massive development boom in the city of 50,000, anchored by his welcoming of the $2.6 billion Encore Boston Harbor casino, which Wynn Resorts opened in 2019 on the Mystic River. Changes to zoning under his tenure paved the way for thousands of housing units and many mixed-use projects to be built, and he has nearly completed a deal with the Kraft Group that would land a New England Revolution soccer stadium in Everett.  
The growth has been nothing short of transformative for the once-scrappy industrial city just north of Boston. Now, Van Campen will inherit both the good and the bad of DeMaria’s legacy. 
I spoke with the mayor-elect at his home in Everett to learn more about his plans for the city and how he will repair the shaken trust in City Hall while also keeping DeMaria’s legacy of development alive. What follows is an edited transcript of our conversation. 
COMMONWEALTH: Coming from City Council, you’re a familiar face to many Everett residents. But for those who may not know you, talk about your background.   
Robert Van Campen: I am a city kid at heart. My parents were renters for a big chunk of their married lives, and they had an opportunity to, like many, live out the American Dream, better their lives, and buy a house, which they bought here in Everett. My house is literally 100 yards away from where my 84-year-old mother still lives. That’s kind of the family homestead. That’s where we still celebrate big holidays – big Italian Christmas Eves and all that stuff. I am very much rooted in our community. I have two children, and my wife Lisa and I are raising them in this house. My daughter is at the University of Connecticut right now. My son is a sophomore in high school. Professionally, I’m a labor and municipal attorney. That’s what I’ve done for about 25 years. I represent public sector workers, private sector workers, and I have been on the City Council for the last two years. I had an earlier stint on the City Council when I was in law school. I was elected in 2000 and served for 14 years. I ran unsuccessfully for mayor at that time against Mayor DeMaria. After that, I left office, enjoyed private life, enjoyed being with my family, enjoyed practicing law, and decided in 2023 that there was this growing need for some different voices on the City Council. I was lucky enough to get elected to ward council. My colleagues apparently saw something, because they made me president of the City Council at my first meeting. I just wanted to be a freshman city councilor, but I was happy to take a leadership role and work with the City Council to drive forward our agenda. 
CW: Why did you decide to get into this mayoral race?  
Van Campen: Earlier this year, it became apparent to me that there was a tremendous appetite for change in our community – not just to change the name on the mayor’s door, but to bring real improvement to people’s lives. Whether dealing with school overcrowding or overdevelopment in our neighborhoods, restoring transparency and accountability to City Hall – it appeared that the rudder started to get a little too loose at City Hall, so I decided to enter the race.

CW: Everett City Hall was thrust into a scandalous light this year. How do you plan to pick up the pieces from that? 
Van Campen: We ran a campaign on restoring trust, transparency, and accountability to City Hall. My plan is to do that on day one. The first part of that is to hire an exceptional professional leadership team, which I am in the throes of doing as we speak. That’s not to say there aren’t professional staff at City Hall today, but I think bringing that in and trying to heal the divisions that we’ve had in our community for the last couple of years is the first step. One of the things I’d like to do is create what I would call a municipal academy, which is nothing more than an opportunity for the various department heads, led by my leadership team, to bring in the people of Everett and have them maybe better understand: What does the chief financial officer do? What is his or her role in the city? What is the city solicitor’s role? What does the assessor do? What does the treasurer do? How does the school budget get funded at City Hall? And ultimately, what is the mayor’s role and the City Council’s role, and who ultimately are they responsible to? They’re responsible to the people. Bringing those kinds of transparent programs and initiatives forward I think will also help heal some of the division and restore some of the trust that has been broken. I want to bring in a far more superior budget tool. I’ve been looking at other municipal websites recently, and I think we could do a much better job throwing open the doors to the city budget. Full transparency. You should be able to go online to the city of Everett’s website and drill down into every line item as a resident and as a taxpayer.  
CW: Do you think residents have lost trust in their city government after the inspector general revealed Mayor DeMaria’s longevity bonuses?  
Van Campen: I don’t want to say they’ve lost trust in the entire government. I think their confidence was shaken in what happened, and their confidence is shaken, perhaps, in whether our systems can ensure that something like that doesn’t happen again, and that what they’re being told is the truth. We’re living in an age today where the truth is under attack at all levels right now. When this issue broke in February, I questioned whether the administration could continue in office, because folks had lost confidence in its ability to navigate, and I think the people of Everett agreed with that sentiment.  
CW: You’re following a big personality in office. What style of leadership will you take on, and how will that differ from the current administration? 
Van Campen: My kids always say that I’m a combination of serious and goofy around them, and that’s just who I am. I’m really comfortable in my own skin. I will set my own leadership style. I don’t walk in anyone’s shadow. I’m going to very much set my own path as mayor. My style will be more collaborative, more constituent-focused right out of the gate, and I think the people of Everett will see a dramatic shift in the political culture of Everett and the view that people outside of Everett have of our community. 
CW: Is there anything about DeMaria’s legacy that you hope to continue as you enter office? 
Van Campen: What can’t be disputed is that Mayor DeMaria has a legacy of transformation in our community. There is absolutely no question about that. After nearly 18 years in office, you see it. You see it particularly in South Everett. You see it on lower Broadway. You see it with Encore. You see it with a potential soccer stadium at the foot of South Everett, and all the development potential that could happen down there. I am committed to making sure that projects that can transform our community continue to go forward. The difference between the mayor and me is that I have a more focused view to ensure that the developers aren’t dictating these projects, and that the people of Everett are the ones in the driver’s seat. For example: the proposed Kraft soccer stadium. I really want to drill down into the potential impacts that stadium will have on both vehicle and pedestrian traffic in that area. I want to make sure those impacts are addressed to the satisfaction of every person in the city of Everett.  
CW: Under DeMaria’s tenure, zoning changes allowed for a development and real estate boom unlike any other the city has seen. Some people might be concerned that the boom is going to stop with you. What would you say to that?  
Van Campen: False rumors. I want to continue our progress while prioritizing the people of Everett and prioritizing our neighborhoods. What I don’t want to see is development that strangles neighborhoods and tears the fabric of those neighborhoods apart. We’ve seen that in recent years. But in our blighted areas, and in the areas where we have transit-oriented hubs, I have no objection to responsible, reasonable development happening there. 
CW: What kind of development does Everett need to see more of that you hope to usher in?  
Van Campen: What I would really like to see is developers starting to focus on our downtown area. Everett Square has remained relatively unchanged for the last 20 years. There’s been no meaningful investment there. I want to change that. I want developers to start noticing the real potential. We have some thriving restaurants, but we can take this to new heights. I’m going to need partners in the private sector to make that happen. They realize that South Everett is such a valuable, dynamic place to invest, but I hope they realize that if they come up the street just half a mile, Everett Square and all of our downtown businesses are too. That is a priority that is a shift from the current administration. 
CW: Something that many Gateway Cities struggle with, including Everett, is how to attract the right mix of both market-rate and affordable housing development that simultaneously brings revenue to the city, is welcomed by most residents, and is something developers are actually incentivized to build. It’s a tough balancing act. How do you plan to manage it? 
Van Campen: The issue is that rents are going down across the country, but they’re going up in Boston. It’s a real challenge to not overbuild while creating enough housing to start to bring prices down. One of the initiatives I’m going to explore as mayor is to create, in City Hall, an office of housing affordability to try to figure these issues out, provide expert guidance to folks who are looking for affordable housing options, and, more importantly, to use the leverage of City Hall to have meaningful conversations with developers. But I do think that is probably the most critical challenge – not just for me as mayor of Everett, but I’m sure for my friends in Somerville, Malden, Medford, Revere, and Chelsea – that we are all going to face over the next couple of years.

CW: You’ve said that you plan to carry forward with plans DeMaria laid for a soccer stadium to be built in Everett. How might that project fit into your residents-first approach to development? 
Van Campen: The New England Revolution has been kind enough to have some community meetings recently, and there’s going to be a whole [Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act Office] process that has to be followed at the state level to ensure that any environmental concerns are mitigated. I will simply take a more aggressive approach to make sure that the voice of the people of Everett is the primary voice at the table when those issues are discussed. Even folks in our state delegation have said that if the infrastructure is not built, the stadium cannot happen. That infrastructure has to happen, and I want to make sure that the people of Everett have a voice in designing what it looks like.  
CW: DeMaria had a vision to turn Everett’s lower Broadway district into an entertainment and hospitality center. Is that a vision you plan on continuing? 
Van Campen: I’ve had initial conversations with some of the larger investors in that part of the city. I understand and acknowledge the boom that has happened down there. That’s something I would like to see continue forward. The real question for me at this point is what does it look like? I haven’t been participating in any of these conversations up to date, so I don’t want to get myself ahead of the curve here. But is it progress I’d like to see continue? Yes, it is.  
CW: Wynn Resorts has put a $400 million expansion on hold at its Encore casino in Everett, saying it has reached an impasse with the city over how much it should pay if the project is built. As you enter office, what kind of relationship will you have with Wynn when it comes to development? 
Van Campen: I’m a negotiator by training, so I think we’ll have a mutually respectful relationship. I want Wynn and Encore to be successful, because if they are successful, the local economy here in Everett is successful, and the people of Everett have greater opportunities for jobs. I think the issue with phase two of that project also relates to the online gaming legislation [which would make online gambling legal in the state and has been criticized by Encore] that is pending at the State House right now. Hopefully the Legislature can dispose of that issue and allow that type of an investment to go forward. 
CW: DeMaria was the highest-paid mayor in Massachusetts, and it drew a lot of controversy. Will you continue to have the highest salary of any mayor in the state? 
Van Campen: I will follow the ordinance that sets the mayor’s compensation. We repealed the ordinance that afforded the mayor a longevity bonus. But the mayor’s compensation, according to city charter, is to be set by city ordinance. That ordinance remains in effect, so I’m going to follow the law. 
CW: Do you think the city ordinance could change under your tenure?  
Van Campen: It could. In terms of all the different priorities in the city, it’s not something that has really been at the forefront or discussed. I do think chief executives, particularly in our current times, deserve fair compensation if we’re going to attract seasoned, experienced municipal executives. Obviously, like any other job in the industry, you have to provide a competitive rate to do that. But that issue hasn’t been discussed. I am not sure it will be discussed anytime in the first six months of my term, simply because there are so many other priorities. But for purposes of today, I’m going to follow the ordinance and have the finance division implement whatever the terms of the ordinance require. 
CW: What is one thing you hope to work on with state lawmakers during your tenure that would benefit Everett? 
Van Campen: First and foremost, I’d like to see them defeat the online gaming legislation as a way to allow for greater investment in lower Broadway. I think that is critical. Another thing I’d like to work with state lawmakers on is a solution to our housing affordability crisis and trying to find a way to incentivize the creation of more, not less, affordable units.

CW: Many Gateway Cities in the Commonwealth could only dream of the amount of development Everett has seen in the last decade. Going forward, what do you think is the city’s role in Greater Boston and the Greater Boston economy? 
Van Campen: I think we are driving the bus right now. It is breathtaking, not only what has happened, but what will happen in the next five to 10 years. I want to see Everett become an urban model for Greater Boston and beyond. I want to make the schools an urban model of excellence and success. Those investments that are going to be made in the next five to 10 years – the job creation that’s going to happen – we’re really putting Everett on the map and taking it to new heights. Our greatest asset in the city of Everett is our geography. We are right on the border of the city of Boston, a world-renowned city. We should be a world-renowned city too, and we can see it happening right before our eyes. I’m blessed that I will be the man who has the privilege to hold the pen to write that next chapter.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/everettmayor-3-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-24 09:57:02.864067

(Photo provided by SC250)COLUMBIA — Nearly 250 years ago, 56 men signed the Declaration of Independence following its adoption in Philadelphia. Four were South Carolinians.
At the South Carolina State Fair this year, more than 10,000 people signed it.
The number of signatures on an enormous replica of the historic document underscored the popularity of an exhibit all about the Revolutionary War, said Molly Fortune, the executive director of the commission in charge of promoting South Carolina’s role in the country’s birth.

The exhibit was so successful, the SC250 Commission is considering ways to make it permanent, or at least keep it open a little longer, Fortune said.
For the past four years, the statewide agency and local commissions have hosted events across the state in preparation for next year’s 250th anniversary of the country’s founding. Those events, which often take place at museums or historical sites, tend to attract history buffs, Fortune said.
Setting up an exhibit at the State Fair, which drew nearly 400,000 people this October, brought the nation’s story to a whole new demographic of people, Fortune said.
While walking through the exhibit, the most common refrain Fortune heard was, “I didn’t know,” she said.
People meant that about all sorts of facts.
Some didn’t realize the contributions Black and Native American people made during the war. Others didn’t even realize next year is the 250th anniversary of the colonies declaring independence from Britain, which didn’t officially recognize the new nation until the 1783 Treaty of Paris.
“You can hear the wonder in their voice,” Fortune said.
Snacking on corndogs and fried Twinkies, fairgoers this year stepped into one of the fairground’s warehouses to find a representation of an 18th century South Carolina swamp. The sound of crickets chirped over the intercoms as visitors wound along a wooden walkway, reading plaques surrounded by foliage.
A fake log cabin and backdrop provided a background of photographs, including for visitors who wanted to put on a historic Overmountain Man uniform, with a linen shirt, a cap and a fox pelt. Reenactors gave dance lessons, period-accurate speeches, and demonstrations of how to write with a quill.
“It really did totally bring to life so many aspects,” said Diana Watson, spokesperson for SC250.
The commission didn’t expect the exhibit to become such a huge hit, Fortune said. She had to get the Declaration of Independence reprinted twice because it ran out of space for signatures during the State Fair’s 12-day run, she said.
The declaration was Fortune’s biggest concern going into the fair.
Though the document explaining the colonies’ fight for freedom says “all men are created equal” with the God-given rights of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” the authors at the Second Continental Congress fell far short of that ideal in reality. They were referring to white men.
Fortune knew some people have complicated relationships with the founding document. So, when fairgoers told her, “It’s not for me,” she talked with them about what it means to recognize every part of history, even the ugliest.
One of the commission’s goals is to highlight the stories often forgotten in the history of the country’s founding. Displays showed the lives of Black and Native American soldiers, as well as women, during the war.
Alongside the stories of those often forgotten was a memorial to a widely known war figure: Gen. Francis Marion, often called the “Swamp Fox” for his guerilla tactics in South Carolina’s backcountry. Some of his correspondence, which the commission is working to compile and make available to the public, was on view for guests to read.
Other displays came from the commission’s grant-funded partners and fellow historical organizations, Fortune said.
The Ninety Six National Historic Site lent the commission some of its displays while its museum undergoes renovations. The Lee County American Revolution committee contributed a traveling display about Black soldiers.

Fortune heard from teachers who said they’d like to use the displays in their classrooms. Fortune told them to come back after the fair ended, and they would work something out.
The exhibit, which cost between $150,000 and $200,000 in state taxpayer funds, is still intact on the state fairgrounds, Fortune said.
Once the commission figures out the logistics, teachers will be able to “go in there and go shopping,” she said.
How they’ll “check out” parts of the exhibit for their classrooms remains in the works. Commissioners also are brainstorming ways to offer off-season tours of the exhibit for people who missed it during the fair or want to see it again, Fortune said.
“It was so well-received,” Fortune said. “We want to know that more people have the opportunity to see it, to see pieces of it.”
SC250 is planning to put on another exhibit at next year’s State Fair with different information about what was happening in South Carolina 250 years ago.
The fair’s organizers jumped at the chance for a second year of working with the commission, considering how much people enjoyed this year’s display, said Nancy Smith, general manager of the State Fair.
Most people associate the fair with carnival rides and fried foods, but education is an integral part of the mission of the nonprofit that runs the fair, Smith said.
“Folks came to the fair, they were able to experience the traditional part of the fair, but they were also introduced to something even greater this year,” Smith said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4308.jpg,,,2025-11-24 09:57:02.864067

(U.S. Coast Guard photo by Lieutenant Christopher Butters)On a dreary November day in Seattle, the U.S. Coast Guard put its past and future on display.
Within sight of the Space Needle, three eye-catching red icebreakers towered over Pier 36. It was the first time since 2006 that the Coast Guard has had three active icebreakers in the same place at the same time.
In the coming years, that scene will become more common, and not just in Seattle. After years of underfunding, the Coast Guard’s icebreaker fleet is undergoing a massive expansion, with almost $9 billion for new ships.
On Tuesday, the U.S. government signed the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort — or ICE Pact — a three-nation agreement with Finland and Canada that will see some of those ships built in Finland, whose shipyards will train Americans to build more. 
“It’s an exciting time to be a polar icebreaker sailor,” said Capt. Jeff Rasnake, commanding officer of the Polar Star, America’s only heavy icebreaker.
So many ships are about to join the Coast Guard’s fleet that the agency isn’t yet sure where it will put them all. The Coast Guard has earmarked millions for a port expansion in Seattle to accommodate three heavy icebreakers, plus another $300 million for Juneau to serve as a port for a medium icebreaker.
More space will be needed on top of that, and Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said his intent is to have as many of the new ships based in Alaska as possible. 
“We want home port decisions on these icebreakers sometime in early 2026,” he said. “That is my goal.”

The need for new icebreakers is clear: As the Earth warms amid climate change, no place is warming faster than the Arctic. Melting ice is opening new routes for shipping, places to mine and drill, and seas to fish or view from the deck of a cruise ship. 
In many cases, control of those new routes is being disputed among nations.
“Right now, things are heating up in the Arctic, and not just on the ice,” said Capt. Kristen Serumgard of the icebreaker Healy.
Russia is expanding its military presence in the Arctic, including with icebreakers, and as NATO confronts Russian aggression in Europe, there’s been international concern that the United States and NATO should be prepared to match Russia in the Arctic as well.
China is operating significant numbers of icebreakers in the Arctic, as are European nations, each interested in maintaining their right to access the area.
“It’s a geopolitical hotbed up there,” Serumgard said. 
Rasnake, who typically works in the comparatively calm Antarctic, said that “with lines being drawn and a lot of different contested (seafloor) land claims, it’s — I wouldn’t say the wild, wild West, but maybe the wild, wild North.”
Shipping traffic through the Arctic Ocean is on the rise, with more ships traveling Russia’s Northern Sea Route and the Canadian-American Northwest Passage each summer.
As yet, the Northwest Passage isn’t regularly used by commercial shipping, said Steve White, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Alaska, which monitors the area for safety risks.
While that’s the case, “we are seeing a trend of more and more traffic, though, going through the Bering Straits, both on the US side and on the Russian side,” he said.
With more ships comes more risk. On Sept. 6, the Dutch cargo ship Thamesborg ran aground in Franklin Strait, part of the Northwest Passage. The accident didn’t release any pollution and no one was injured, but it took 33 days for the ship to be freed and sent on its way.
The Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route each funnel through the Bering Strait, which is split between American and Russian control. 
“The reason this is so important for people to understand is that the Bering Strait — you’ve only got about (51) miles between the US and Russia, and you have the biodiversity, the wildlife that’s there,” White said. “This comes at a time where we’re getting more storms, the communities are struggling up there with food security and the top priority, the salmon returns … the fabric of our Alaskan communities up there is under threat, and it’s under threat from what’s going on with the weather changing and increased traffic.”
The U.S. Coast Guard is the federal government’s nautical Swiss Army knife — it performs rescue operations, enforces fishing laws, stops drug smugglers, runs border patrols, performs safety inspections, anti-pollution patrols, counter-piracy patrols, and enforces America’s maritime laws.   
The U.S. Navy runs submarines under the Arctic ice, but it doesn’t operate icebreakers. It leaves the Coast Guard to do that — on the Great Lakes, on American rivers, and in the Arctic and Antarctic. 
But for years, the national icebreaker fleet has been underfunded.
When Nome, home to the endpoint of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, ran short of fuel in 2012, the U.S. Coast Guard struggled to muster a single icebreaker, the Healy, to escort a Russian icebreaking tanker to the town. 
At the time, the Healy was the Coast Guard’s lone operating icebreaker. Soon afterward, it reactivated the Polar Star, which had been mothballed because it was old and needed maintenance.
While both ships continue to operate, they’re less capable than modern ships and have suffered mechanical breakdowns, some significant. 
Last year, the Healy caught fire and had to abbreviate its summer patrol. While it returned to service in the fall and went on to discover a volcano-like mountain on the Arctic seafloor, it’s now due for an extended period of maintenance.
“She’s 25 years old and been breaking ice for 25 years, right? That is hard on a ship,” Serumgard said.

Two American icebreakers in the Arctic Ocean in 2025
If America’s icebreaking fleet is near a low ebb, this summer saw the first steps toward the planned resurgence.
As a stopgap until new ships arrive, Congress last year ordered the purchase of the Aiviq, an oilfield services ship designed to work in the Arctic Ocean. 
Eight years ago, following a disaster that saw the Aiviq lose control of a drilling rig during a storm, the Coast Guard deemed the ship “not suitable for military service without substantial refit.”
Since then, the ship has been overhauled and the Coast Guard’s opinion has changed. 
After Congress appropriated the money, the Coast Guard purchased the Aiviq, quickly converted it, and in August this year, commissioned it as the icebreaker Storis.
At the time of that commissioning, commanding officer Capt. Corey Kerns said the ship and its crew would “need to learn to crawl” before they could get fully up and running.
In addition, there were unanswered questions about how well the Storis would handle the kinds of storms that troubled the Aiviq. 
In October, Kerns sat down for another interview after returning from the Arctic.
“One of the things that kind of surprised me was that it went smoother than maybe I would have expected,” he said. 
“She was able to perform, get through the whole thing without any major issues,” Kerns said of the ship’s first patrol.
As a result, Kerns felt confident enough to guide the Storis into the Arctic Ocean, where it worked with the icebreaker Healy to shadow two Chinese research ships in parts of the ocean that the United States claims.
The presence of those Chinese ships and others that have operated in conjunction with Russian ships has alarmed some American officials. 
If China and Russia are present in the region, it behooves the United States to be there too, Kerns said in August.
“The ability to be present guarantees your ability to to maintain sovereignty. And that’s what we’re trying to get at here in the Arctic. We need more icebreakers to be present in our waters and be clear what is our waters,” he said.
The Coast Guard cutter Waesche, a “thin-hulled” ship, also monitored the Chinese ships. Both it and the Storis participated in Arctic Edge 2025, a military training operation near the Russian border that also included Canadian forces.

There’s still work to be done with the Storis, Kerns said. It hasn’t been certified to host Coast Guard helicopters yet, and it hasn’t done a full icebreaking test.
“We got into the ice and we showed that she could break flat ice to some extent, at certain speeds, but … probably not a fully worthy test of capability in the ice, so we’re discussing that now,” he said.
Thirteen years ago, the Aiviq lost control of the drilling rig Kulluk, causing it to run aground on Kodiak Island. That disaster took place after rough seas flooded the Aiviq’s fuel tanks and caused it to lose power. 
This summer, as the Storis sailed across the Gulf of Alaska, it again encountered rough seas. 
“There were a few nights where you didn’t sleep as well, but it was perfectly safe,” Kerns said.
He said his crew are already overhauling equipment and preparing for next summer in the Arctic, working in conjunction with the Healy.
That ship spent 129 days at sea this summer, primarily focusing on science, according to an official Coast Guard description of the patrol.
“We know more about the surface of the moon than we know about the seafloors, so it’s kind of a really amazing area of exploration,” Serumgard said.
En route back to Seattle, the Healy was diverted to help search and rescue efforts in Southwest Alaska following Typhoon Halong, which devastated the region and left hundreds of people homeless. 
In Seattle, the Polar Star was preparing to leave on a five-month roundtrip to Antarctica, where it will help supply research outposts across that continent.
Rasnake said he believes the Polar Star is in the best shape it’s been since being reactivated in 2013, and he looks forward to it possibly breaking the record of the most Antarctic missions by any Coast Guard icebreaker. That would come — if all goes well — in December 2026 or January 2027.

A huge expansion of the fleet is on the horizon
If the Polar Star does break that record, it may not have many opportunities to expand on it. The Coast Guard’s first new heavy icebreaker since the Polar Star is now under construction in Mississippi.
Named the Polar Sentinel, it’s expected to be complete by 2030. The Republican-backed budget plan that President Donald Trump nicknamed the “Big Beautiful Bill” includes funding for two other heavy icebreakers after the Sentinel.
Thirteen other icebreakers were funded in that bill, said Sullivan, the Alaska senator.
“There’s funding for three to four Arctic Security mediums. Those are the target ones for our state. And then there’s 10 light icebreakers. Those are smaller. Those do work in the Great Lakes and other things like that,” he said. 
The medium icebreakers, known as “Arctic Security Cutters,” are among 11 planned ships being built by two separate industry groups. Canada’s Davie Shipbuilding is planning to build five ships — two in Finland, and then three at a to-be-expanded Texas shipyard.
The second group, which includes American, Canadian and Finnish firms, will build two ships in Finland and a third simultaneously in the United States, then build three others in the United States.
The first five ships are expected to be delivered to the Coast Guard within 36 months of a contract being signed, meaning they could be patrolling the Arctic Ocean before the end of the decade.
The newly commissioned Storis will also need upgrades to complete its conversion from a civilian ship. First on the docket may be additional military communications gear, but Kerns said the Coast Guard is also considering how to fit more crew aboard.
In the longer term, Kerns — who has a nautical engineering background — is working with his crew on plans for a deeper refit that could allow the Storis to serve as a kind of “logistics ship.”
As currently built, it carries several large holds originally intended for drilling mud and other materials needed for oil wells at sea. Those could be repurposed, he said this month, and his crew is coming up with ideas for the ship’s first major refit, expected sometime after summer 2026.
The new ships and the changes to the Storis are only part of the Coast Guard’s plan in the coming years. Each ship will also need people and equipment ashore for maintenance and support. The Coast Guard is involved in an ongoing struggle to acquire acreage to expand its Seattle base, which the port authority is reluctant to cede.
Pier space at the Coast Guard’s Alameda base, in California, is also constrained. 
“We’re looking for space in all possible areas,” said Capt. Brian Krautler, chief of operations for the Coast Guard’s Pacific Area. 
The Big Beautiful Bill included $300 million to build a base in Juneau to host the Storis. Other places in Alaska — Seward, Kodiak, Nome, or Dutch Harbor — might also accommodate one or more of the new Arctic Security Cutters. Kodiak is home to the largest Coast Guard base in the country.
Speaking this week at the signing of the so-called ICE Pact, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said that the Trump administration sees the expansion of the icebreaker fleet as a top priority. 
“Today is a major milestone in the race to secure the Arctic for all of our countries,” she said. “The Arctic is the world’s last, most wild frontier, and our adversaries are racing to claim its strategic position and its rich natural resources for their own. If we give up that high ground, then we will condemn future generations to permanent insecurity, and we’re not going to let that happen on our watch.”

Following the mass shooting at Michigan State University in 2023, state lawmakers advanced a number of gun safety policies, including requiring universal background checks of firearms sales, instituting safe storage requirements, and permitting judges to issue extreme risk protection orders to confiscate firearms from individuals at risk of harming themself or others, a policy sometimes referred to as a red flag law.
Months after these laws took effect in 2024, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive order creating the task force, charging its members with improving how those laws are implemented alongside maximizing resources and strengthening coordination across government sectors to reduce gun violence and save lives.

“There are a lot of issues here that have not historically been thought of as public health issues, and only when we’ve taken this really comprehensive public health approach have we been able to implement real change,” Bagdasarian said. “Gun violence is one of those issues.”
While people often view gun violence as a political issue, a legal issue, or a constitutional issue, it is also a health issue, Bagdasarian explained, noting that gun violence is the leading cause of death among children and teens. 
She pointed to car accidents, which were previously the leading cause of death in children, as another example.
“They are no longer the leading cause of death. They have been declining year upon year, decade upon decade, and it took this whole of government, really comprehensive public health approach to do this,” Bagdasarian said. “There was no single law, there was no single change, but it was years of incremental change.” 
This is what the task force is looking to do for gun violence, she said. 
The report offers several recommendations which can be addressed directly by government agencies, legislative action, through changing government policy, collecting data, supplying funding, or raising awareness. 
It also offers recommendations on reducing the rates of firearm injury and death in specific instances, including suicide, community violence, school safety and firearm related intimate partner violence. 










Because at the end of the day, I think we all have a common goal, and that is to keep our community safe, to keep our families safe and to keep our children safe.


– Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian - Michigan's chief medical executive


On top of the state’s existing policies, the task force also recommended requiring waiting periods for firearm purchases, increasing the age requirement for purchasing a firearm to 21, banning large capacity magazines as well as the sale, purchase and possession of assault weapons and ensuring the gun industry can face legal accountability.
To address gun violence in schools, the report calls on lawmakers to strengthen school safety legislation to protect students and ensure struggling students have access to the help they need. It also recommends standardizing training for school safety officers, promoting a statewide school safety tip line and supporting community violence intervention initiatives aimed at addressing the root causes of violence.
Several of the task force’s recommendations aligned with policies already introduced in the Legislature, including requiring licensing and inspections for gun dealers, barring weapons from government buildings, banning devices to convert semiautomatic weapons into fully automatic weapons and banning ghost guns – firearms without a serial number that are assembled from kits or 3D-printed parts.

To improve the effectiveness of the state’s red flag laws, the task force called for clear guidelines for firearm relinquishment. It also encouraged officials to remove barriers to filing extreme risk protection orders and personal protection orders and improve enforcement. They also called on leaders to strengthen victim support services to address the harms of domestic violence.
The task force also recommended more public education on the state’s secure storage laws and expanded access to gun locks. 
When assembling the task force and its various issue-based subcommittees, Bagdasarian said it was really important to the group and the governor’s team that all the right voices were at the table. 
The task force brought in folks with backgrounds in suicide prevention, community violence intervention, individuals with backgrounds in school safety, members of law enforcement, members of the Department of Education, hunters, gun owners and firearm safety experts, she explained. 
“It was multiple departments across the state, but also people who represented the voices of communities – of urban communities and rural communities – and different personal backgrounds,” Bagdasarian said.  “Because at the end of the day, I think we all have a common goal, and that is to keep our community safe, to keep our families safe and to keep our children safe.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2451-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 09:57:02.864067

Will migrant and undocumented immigrant workers return to California farms next year?
As the harvest season comes to a close, that question looms over Central Valley — raising concerns about the region’s economy and the state’s agricultural industry, reports CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
In addition to California’s overall economy and the economies of its big cities, some of the state’s small farm towns are feeling the fallout of President Donald Trump’s aggressive campaign to conduct the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.
Total taxable transactions in Fresno County’s Firebaugh, for example, were down 29% in the second quarter of this year compared to the same time last year. In nearby Chowchilla, total taxable receipts were down 21%. The food bank in Firebaugh also used to serve about 50 families — now that number is up to 150.

Ben Gallegos, Firebaugh City Manager: “We need those individuals to drive our community. They’re the ones that eat at our local restaurants, they’re the ones that shop at our local stores. Without them, what do we do? They’re scared to come out because of the color of their skin.” 

Migrant and immigrant labor also help power the state’s $60-billion agricultural industry. In an October notice, the U.S. Department of Labor rang the alarm about how losing farmworkers across the country could threaten the nation’s food supply and cause “significant disruptions” to “prices for U.S. consumers.”
Though it’s difficult to know both the number of farmworkers currently employed and how much the fear of deportation is affecting the industry’s employment, some say California farmworkers are weighing the risk of staying or self-deporting. 

Jesus Ibañez, a Fresno immigration attorney who works with farmworkers: “My clients say this country’s not for them anymore. They feel like they’re on borrowed time here. That sentiment is not one I heard a lot one year ago.”

CA prisons go over budget

California’s multibillion-dollar prison system is on track to exceed its budget, despite prison closures and trimmed payroll expenses, writes CalMattes’ Cayla Mihalovich.
This year the state budget set aside $17.5 billion for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. But over three years, the department is expected to overspend by about $850 million — and contribute to the state’s overall projected budget deficit — according to a new report from the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office.
Part of the projected overspend is because costs are rising. In May the department received $357 million in a one-time allocation from the general fund because it didn’t have the money to cover workers’ compensation, overtime and food for incarcerated people.
The department’s budget woes come despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s closing prisons in an attempt to save the state money. Next year Newsom aims to close the fifth prison under his governorship, a facility in Riverside County. His administration estimates each prison closure saves about $150 million a year.

Let’s dive into some election news:

New gubernatorial contender: California U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell unveiled his candidacy for governor on a late-night show last week. The seven-term congressmember is an outspoken critic of Trump and helped lead the second impeachment of the president following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack. Though Swalwell’s initial campaign launch offered no specific policy details, Swalwell said “no one will keep California safer” than he will. He also cited his experience as a planning commissioner and city councilmember for his California hometown of Dublin. Read more from CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.

Museums and universities still resist returning cultural items to Native American tribes, but through repatriation agreements tribes can regain legal control of the items and decide how their cultural heritages are used, writes Jeannine Pedersen-Guzmán, tribal archives, collections and repatriation manager for the Yuhaaviatam of San Manuel Nation in Highland.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-24 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Delta barn where Emmett Till was slain is bought as a ‘sacred site’,Jerry Mitchell,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/24/barn-emmett-till-sacred-site/,"The Emmett Till Interpretive Center has purchased the barn where 14-year-old Till was tortured and killed, thanks to a $1.5 million gift from TV producer Shonda Rimes.","The long-hidden monument to bigotry and brutality — the Mississippi Delta barn where Emmett Till was tortured and killed in 1955 — will soon become a “sacred site” for all to see.
On Monday, the Emmett Till Interpretive Center announced that it had purchased the barn, thanks to a $1.5 million gift from TV producer Shonda Rhimes, who was moved to donate after reading about the barn, saying, “My hope is that this story never gets lost.”

Dave Tell, author of “Remembering Emmett Till,” said the barn was “written out of history by the very men who committed the crime there — erased from public memory as part of a broader effort to bury the truth and protect white perpetrators. Preserving it now is an intentional act of restoration.”
About 2 a.m. on Aug. 28, 1955, J.W. Milam, his brother, Roy Bryant, and others abducted the Black Chicago 14-year-old from the home of his uncle that he was visiting and took him to the barn, where they beat and killed him.
Till’s mother, Mamie, insisted on an open casket “to let the world see what they did to my son.” Thousands streamed past his body. Some wept. Some fainted. All were moved.
Mamie Till is held by Gene Mobley, who would later marry her, while she stares at the brutalized body of her son, Emmett Till. She opened the casket, and more than 50,000 saw his body. This photo taken by David Jackson, now in public domain, appeared in both the Chicago Defender and Jet magazine.
The brothers admitted to authorities they had kidnapped Till, but claimed they had released him unharmed. A month later, they went on trial for murder, but an all-white jury acquitted them.
Months later, the brothers admitted in Look magazine that they had indeed beaten and killed Till, but authorities were unable to prosecute the brothers again because of double jeopardy.
That Look magazine article also concealed the existence of the barn because that would implicate the others involved, some of whom worked at the barn, Tell said. “Till was killed because of racism. And the barn was pushed out of public memory because of racism. It’s all part of the same story.”
For Keith Beauchamp, producer of the “Till” film and director-producer of “The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,” the barn’s preservation brings mixed emotions.
“On one hand, it’s significant that a physical site connected to Emmett Till’s story will be preserved for future generations,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s also a place that represents deep pain and injustice. Regardless, it is a part of American history that must be acknowledged rather than forgotten, because remembering helps us understand and avoid repeating past mistakes.”
Beauchamp thanked Rhimes for her “generous gift to help preserve this history, especially during a time of debate over how our past should be remembered.”
He praised Jeff Andrews, who bought the property that included the barn in 1994. After learning about the barn, Andrews began to let Till’s family and other visitors spend time at the historic site.
Beauchamp praised his care, “maintaining the barn and welcoming the public, kept the site meaningful long before any official preservation began.”
In 2007, a group of Tallahatchie County citizens, Black and white, gathered outside the courthouse in Sumner — the same courthouse where Till’s killers walked free — and publicly apologized.

An open letter published Monday on the Emmett Till Interpretive Center website says, “That act of honesty became a moral compass for our work. Since then, we have restored the courthouse where justice failed, commemorated the riverbank where Emmett’s body was found, and replaced the signs that hatred tried to destroy. Every project has carried the same conviction: a nation does not grow stronger by forgetting; it grows stronger by telling the truth. The barn is the next chapter in that conviction.”
On its website, the center said, “We did not want to have to pay for sacred ground. We understand that many other people also feel that even $1 is too much to pay for a site where such deep harm occurred. It’s an obstacle we wrestled with every step of the way. We explored every possible alternative to purchase, including asking for the owner to donate the property and exploring legal options including easements and eminent domain, but none were viable.
“The turning point came when we asked ourselves: What happens if someone else buys it? We could not risk this site — one of the most sacred in American history — falling into the hands of speculators or even hate groups. The barn is simply too important to leave to chance.”
The center, which has partnered with the National Park Service, will hold the title to the barn: “We chose preservation over risk, and truth over silence — because you can’t put a price on our history.”
Davis Houck, the founding director of the Emmett Till Archives at Florida State University as well as the Fannie Lou Hamer Professor of Rhetorical Studies, said the fact the money to purchase the barn came from private philanthropy “makes this a most generous gift — to the community of Drew, to the state of Mississippi, and ultimately to the entire nation.”
The center’s director, Patrick Weems, told Mississippi Today that buying the barn is just the start of this major project for the nonprofit. “Now we’re working to raise the resources to transform it into a sacred site,” he said.
By the 75th anniversary of Till’s lynching in 2030, the center says it plans to open the barn “as a part of a larger public memorial — a place of truth, creativity and conscience. Visitors will come not to look at tragedy, but to confront their own role in the ongoing work of democracy.”
The center says its role “is not possession, but protection — serving as caretakers on behalf of the community and the nation.”
The center says its work “has always been shaped by the truth, courage and moral vision of the Till family, especially Mamie Till-Mobley’s charge that ‘let the world see.’ … We will continue to listen to and engage family members, descendants, and community elders as we transform this site of trauma into a sacred space for remembrance, healing and collective conscience.”
Till’s cousin, Deborah Watts, co-founder of the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation, echoed the center’s sentiment. “We consider that area sacred ground where Emmett was murdered,” she said.

She welcomes further conversations with the center and wants to learn more about the upcoming plans, she said. “Will the family’s concerns be in consideration?”
Possible plans include creating a welcome center for visitors in nearby Drew. “For too long, people in the Delta — especially in places like Drew — have carried the weight of this story without the world truly seeing us,” said Gloria Dickerson, founder of We2Gether Creating Change, a nonprofit based in Drew. “The barn’s preservation means our voices, our land and our legacy will finally be part of how the world remembers Emmett Till — and how it learns from him.”
Another welcome center may be built in Mound Bayou, Mississippi’s first all-Black town, where Medgar Evers once sold insurance for his mentor, civil rights leader and surgeon Dr. T.R.M. Howard.
Both men worked on the Till case, tracking down witnesses for the historic trial that drew international attention. The injustice of the killers getting away with murder helped propel the modern civil rights movement.
Author Wright Thompson, who wrote “The Barn” about this historic piece of soil, called the purchase “the most important thing to happen to the Delta in generations because history is most accurately told here, and most reliably erased, through the land. Who owns it, who farms it, who lived and died on it, whose ghost is trapped in it. The Delta remains a place where power is tied to ownership of the dirt.”
He praised Rhimes for stepping “into the breach and through her generosity, the dirt has been reclaimed, and once reclaimed, the slow process of cleaning the blood from it can begin. This is a place people will visit for generations.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/06093116/IMG_4926-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-24 09:57:02.864067
,California,2025-11-24 13:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,How fear of Trump’s immigration blitz is changing life in California farm towns,Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/11/immigration-california-farms/,"Tax receipts are down almost 30% in one California farm town, where immigrants are afraid to go out and some longtime workers are weighing self-deportation during the second Trump administration.","Trailing in the shade of a tractor-pulled harvester, a small huddle of people in broad hats trawl the ochre rows of a green field. Every six or so feet, someone squats down and pulls into the morning sunlight a bright, spotted watermelon. 
Walking a dozen yards behind this crew of pickers is their supervisor, Raul. He has done this for 21 years, since he was 18. 
He, better than anybody, knows that perfectly ripe watermelons aren’t just pulled off the vine, they’re chosen. And the choosing still relies, as it ever has, on workers who are delicate with the fruit and severe with the choice. The job requires years of repetition: seeing the right melon, bending to heft it, cutting its root and placing it carefully on the harvester bed or a bag hanging off the back. 
Rookies have trouble. They pick a melon before it’s ready, or they fumble the blades and cut themselves, or their bodies simply inform them after a day or a week of bending and lifting and bending and lifting that they will not be getting out of bed that morning. 
Raul knows this land. He raised his kids in the farmland around the town of Firebaugh, 38 miles west of Fresno. 
He points to a grove of full-grown almond trees near the Del Bosque melon farm where he works. 
“We were putting in those trees when they were young, my first year,” Raul said in Spanish.
For the last two decades, Raul would drive north when the melon harvest ends to work in the vineyards and then the apple and cherry orchards. 
But this year is different, and Raul, who didn’t want his last name used in this story because he is in the country illegally, is not sure how much longer he can stay in the United States. 
As this year’s harvest ends, the small Central Valley towns that rely on migrant or undocumented labor to survive are themselves forced to imagine the end of a way of life. 
The worry here is the workers might not return next year, at least not in the numbers that sustain local economies and power the state’s $60 billion agricultural industry, which grows three-fourths of the fruits and nuts consumed in the U.S.
The second Trump administration has pledged to carry out the largest deportation program in American history. They have, so far, mostly left the agricultural industry alone. But Trump and his advisers have wavered on whether to protect farms from immigration raids, so the seasonal workers and their employers will have to wait and see.
In the meantime, what connects tiny truck stop towns and big cities of this part of the valley is fear: of tightened water allocations, of market turbulence and, this year, of immigration agents.

Small farm towns in the Central Valley are similar in their seasonal economics to a beach town on the East Coast: Both swell in summer with a population boom, then dig in for a slow winter. Firebaugh City Manager Ben Gallegos said the town of 4,000 grows to 8,000 people in the summer, then empties out after the harvest. 
The story plays out in the numbers, but already this year’s numbers tell a different tale.
In the second quarter of the year, which runs from April 1 to June 30, total taxable transactions in Firebaugh were down 29% from the same quarter last year, according to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. In nearby Chowchilla, total taxable receipts are down 21% in the second quarter of this year compared to the same period last year.  
People don’t want to shop or go out to eat, Gallegos said. The city of Firebaugh is staring down cuts to its police force, its parks and its senior center. In September, the appearance of county probation officers dressed in green fatigues caused waves of panicked Whatsapp texts. Some people went into hiding. 
The food bank in Firebaugh used to serve about 50 families. Today, at weekly distributions behind city hall, that number is up to 150. When it’s over, volunteers take the remaining food boxes to families who are too afraid to leave their homes.  
“We need those individuals to drive our community,” Gallegos said. “They’re the ones that eat at our local restaurants, they’re the ones that shop at our local stores. Without them, what do we do? 
“They’re scared to come out because of the color of their skin.” 
Raul and his crew of six pickers will have to choose, too. Will they come back?

Borrowed time
“My clients say this country’s not for them anymore,” said Fresno immigration attorney Jesus Ibañez, who works with farmworkers. “They feel like they’re on borrowed time here. That sentiment is not one I heard a lot one year ago.”
The choices to stay or self-deport come down to money, but also the futures those farmworkers want for their children born in the United States, Ibañez said. 
Sometimes the choice is more complicated – the U.S. isn’t as safe for them as it was, but its school districts still offer things like mental health care and physical therapy that migrant workers fear they won’t get in their home countries. Balanced against that is the possibility of one or both parents being deported, leaving the children with no legal guardians in this country. 
Statistically, it’s difficult to even know the number of farmworkers employed today, let alone how much the fear of deportation is affecting employment in the industry. In late October, Ag Alert, a publication of the California Farm Bureau, broke the news that both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Labor canceled annual farmworker labor surveys. That means that, for the first time since the late 1980s, there is no federal documentation of farmworker hours, wages or demographics. Historically, about 40% of farmworkers in the last decade were undocumented. 
The nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that more immigrants left the country or were deported this year than the number who arrived. If the trend holds until the end of the year, 2025 will be the first year since the 1960s that the population of immigrants in the U.S. falls. 
For Raul, the question of returning is simple. He will need to earn money so he can support his kids, so he plans on coming back. 
“Que quisiera un padre? Raul said. “Quiere que sea lo mejor para los hijos.”
What would a father want? He wants what’s best for his children.

A town shaped by a river
The road into Firebaugh rolls up and over a wash, next to the spot where Andrew Firebaugh founded a ferry across the San Joaquin River that became an important stop on stagecoach routes. The river has always been what kept this town alive, first as an obstacle around which they built a settlement and later as the lifeblood of its farms and fields.
Just outside of town, the pavement has fractured and buckled. The street signs are tiny and faded on the broad grid of roads bounded by fields that push right up to the street. You orient yourself with both cardinal directions and crops. 
Prunus amygdalus, also called almond trees, look like they’re raising their arms. Pistacia vera, the pistachio tree, look like they’re shrugging. Uncovered truck bed bins spill ripe red tomatoes on tight turns. Tractors with their tillers raised trundle slowly down the highway. On the side of the road bobs of lettuce heads peek out of the ground, followed by a massive pile of unhulled almonds, and then a series of palm trees, some very tall and some a little squat.

At the corner of one of these roads, just before it meets the interstate, is the melon farm owned by Joe Del Bosque, Raul’s employer of 21 years. And the first thing people inclined to these kinds of questions will ask Del Bosque is why he hires undocumented labor. 
He begins explaining his trouble hiring people on the federal H-2A visa, which permits employers to hire foreign seasonal workers. It’s not just that he has to pay them $3 more per hour, Del Bosque said. It’s that he must also pay for their transportation to and from the farm every day. He must pay for the rooms where they sleep and the food they eat. It is, he said, economically impossible to rely on the visa program. 
The next suggestion is hiring local people. Del Bosque laughed and said he tried that. The locals made it a week, at the most, and then found some other way to make money that didn’t leave them sore all over. 
He knows that one day soon, he’ll likely have to turn over operations to the only family member active in the business, his son-in-law. But that’s only if there’s still a farm to hand over. 
“I don’t have a lot of confidence that the future of our farm and a lot of farms is looking very good right now,” Del Bosque said.

The U.S. Department of Labor is already sounding the alarm on losing farmworkers and the threat that poses to the nation’s food supply in a notice in the Federal Register in October. 
“The near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce, results in significant disruptions to production costs and threatening the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers,” the department said in a rule-making proposal that would allow employers to pay H-2A workers less than they are paying now. 
“Unless the Department acts immediately to provide a source of stable and lawful labor, this threat will grow,” the notice said, citing the likelihood of enhanced immigration enforcement under the budget bill Trump signed earlier this year.
Those longer-term consequences in the labor market won’t be felt evenly.
This is Trump country
Fresno County and the rest of the Central Valley went for Trump in the 2024 election. Del Bosque calls himself a conservative, though he donates to both parties – Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and former President Barack Obama have both made public visits to his acreage. 
Next to his farm – right up on the property line where everyone will see it – is a massive Trump 2024 sign, erected by his neighbor. No one driving to the Del Bosque Farm will miss it. Del Bosque laughs about it, but it’s also a reflection of how their differing crops help define their politics.

Del Bosque grows melons, which are labor intensive and require lots of people to work long hours. He supports an easier path to employment for undocumented workers. Next door, his neighbor grows almonds. They only require one person to drive a “shaker” to get the nuts out of the trees and another to operate the basket that catches them as they fall. His neighbor, whom CalMatters was unable to contact, doesn’t require much labor at all. 
“Here’s the thing, not all farms are the same, not all farmers are the same,” Del Bosque said. “I’m concerned about these people. (The neighbor) is not concerned about that, because he has almonds. He manages his almonds with just him and one or two more people. 
“He can do his whole farm with two, three people. So this immigration (enforcement) does not affect him at all.”
Author and Central Valley farmer David Mas Masumoto wrote about neighborly tension in his 1995 “Epitaph for a Peach.”  
We depend on labor from Mexico, part of a seasonal flow of men and families. Many come here for the summer, return to Mexico during the slow winter months, and return the following year. They’re predominantly young men with the faces of boys. We’re dependent on their strong backs and quick hands. And they are hungry for work.… 
This September, farmers drive down the road staring straight ahead, steering clear of a chance meeting with a competitor who was once a neighbor. Eyes avoid eyes, hands hesitate and refrain from waving. It’s an ugly September.
Politics out here can make it a whole ugly season.

‘Big and rapid change’
What if they don’t come back? 
“We don’t have a precedent for trying to understand that major of a disruption to our state’s economy and demographics,” said Liz Carlisle, an associate professor in the Environmental Studies Program at UC Santa Barbara. 
Something is changing in one of the world’s most productive agricultural regions. Wine grapes are going unharvested, rotting in the fields, as exports to Canada collapsed under new tariffs and younger consumers started shying away from alcohol. Land values are cratering in places with limited water, leaving farmers in multi-million dollar debt. Water costs are skyrocketing in part because of a 2014 conservation law that seeks to regulate years of agricultural over-pumping. 
“I do think we’re looking at the potential of really big and rapid change to California’s agricultural sector and all of the workers and everything that touches the economy,” Carlisle said. “It’s kind of a perfect storm because you have major shifts in trade policy at the same time as you have major shifts in the workforce at the same time you have major shifts in climate and potential regulatory responses to those climate impacts.
“So that’s a lot of huge transformations for people in the agricultural sector to try to manage at once.” 
This year, the problems were the usual problems: Five or six big storms clobbered the Central Valley with rain and hail, hitting young crops just as they were approaching maturity. But larger battles loom. 
During the first Trump administration, the labor market for Central Valley farmers tightened significantly, said California Fresh Fruits Association president Daniel Hartwig, when migration numbers plummeted and farms would lose workers to a neighboring operation that offered an extra 25 cents per hour. 
During this second go-round with Trump as president, those concerns seem almost archaic. Now, Hartwig said, he’ll spend a couple hours every week running down rumors of immigration enforcement: an unmarked white van in Madera County that turned out to belong to a carpet cleaning business; a cluster of cars outside a health clinic that turned out to be a local police operation; a shaky TikTok of unknown provenance showing men in green fatigues that sent farmworkers rushing back to their homes. 
“If you did let your imagination run wild, especially if you were undocumented, everywhere you look, around the corner, is somebody that’s you’re fearful is going to try and get you and deport you,” Hartwig said. 
Now these towns in the lower basin of the Central Valley hunker down for an anxious winter, on the farms, at the food bank, in Firebaugh’s City Hall. 
They are dependent on so many factors out of their own control. Executive impulses in the White House. Cloud formations and wind speeds. Commodity prices set globally. Water prices set locally. And in the winter there is time to think and there is time to ask questions. 
Will the federal government increase immigration enforcement at farms? Will it rain enough early in the season? Will it rain too much when the fruit is in the fields? Could there be a repeat of last year’s heat wave? Or this year’s storms? What if the water gets costlier? What if the commodities get cheaper? 
And a question perhaps more crucial than any other: What if they don’t come back?

Guest Commentary written by

Governor Gavin Newsom and President Donald Trump rarely agree on anything. Their feud has played out for years on immigration raids, wildfire relief and the moral direction of American democracy. 
Yet this month, their rivalry produced an unlikely harmony. Within days of each other, one issued a message and the other a proclamation recognizing Native American Heritage Month.
Trump’s message wrapped its praise of Native peoples in patriotism and national unity. “As we prepare to celebrate 250 glorious years of American independence, we honor the generations of Native Americans whose service have strengthened our country,” the White House statement reads.
Newsom’s proclamation used the language of empathy and inclusion: “As Californians navigate federal policies impacting our communities …  we shine a light on the first people of this nation — often relocated to this state by force through similar federal policies throughout history — who have nonetheless found ways to persist, resist, and thrive.”
Despite their opposing tones, both rely on the same story: Native peoples exist within the United States not as nations whose sovereignty predates it. 
Each statement celebrates endurance but ignores the political relationship that defines it. Both portray Native peoples as contributors to the American project, not as governments that still hold authority over their lands and citizens. 
In different registers, the progressive governor and the populist president perform the same act of erasure, turning the first peoples of this land into symbols of American virtue.
Newsom’s proclamation goes further than most. He describes the forced relocations, boarding schools and assimilation policies that targeted Native peoples, and he honors their cultural revival. 
Yet by merging California’s original Native nations with Native peoples who relocated here from other states, the text blurs a critical distinction: California’s tribes are not guests the state has “embraced;” they are sovereign governments on their own land. 
The proclamation’s tone of benevolent inclusion allows California to appear enlightened without addressing its continuing responsibilities — from unrecognized tribes, to land and water rights still under contest today.
Trump’s statement takes a simpler route to the same destination. 
By thanking Native Americans for strengthening “our Nation’s greatness,” it folds them into a single patriotic narrative that leaves no space for self-determination. It praises survival while reaffirming U.S. dominance — the familiar pattern of celebrating diversity while denying power.
These messages matter, because political statements shape how the public understands California’s and the nation’s relationship with its Native nations. 
When political leaders talk about “heritage” but not “sovereignty,” they encourage citizens to see Native peoples as part of the past instead of as governments still exercising authority in the present.
That misunderstanding has practical consequences. Across the state, tribal governments manage forests, restore rivers, operate education and health systems and lead climate adaptation projects that benefit all Californians. Yet when sovereignty is ignored, those partnerships are treated as charitable collaboration, rather than as government-to-government obligations.
For non-Native Californians, this is not only about history; it is about how our state governs itself today. Building fire-resilient landscapes, addressing drought and managing growth all depend on respecting tribal authority and knowledge. Recognition without power is not reconciliation; it is continuity by another name.
If Native American Heritage Month is to mean anything, it should mark a shift from ceremony to accountability. California can honor Native peoples not by congratulating itself for inclusion, but by deepening partnerships with the sovereign nations whose lands make this state possible.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/092223-Native-American-Day-MG-CM-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-24 08:56:35.517697

Guest Commentary written by

Jeannine Pedersen-Guzmán
Jeannine Pedersen-Guzmán is the tribal archives, collections, and repatriation manager for the Yuhaaviatam of San Manuel Nation in Highland, CA.


Imagine your relatives’ bones stored in the basement of an unfamiliar university or museum. 
Boxes of ancestors and artifacts are often stacked on top of each other, for use in research, education or just curiosity. Mostly they are ignored or forgotten, left to collect dust.
When I first started working in museums, I thought they were magical places full of history, and that universities stood for truth and learning. But I soon realized that for Native people, these places can be painful. 
What I saw as saving history, others saw as losing it. What I thought was education, others felt was misrepresentation.
Ever since museums and universities were created in the U.S., Native peoples’ stories have been told by those who colonized their lands and spread harmful ideas. 
This led to more than 100 years of taking their heritage from them without permission. Museums and universities took hundreds of thousands of Native American human remains and millions of cultural items.
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, enacted in 1990, challenged these practices. It gave Indigenous communities a legal path to reclaim their ancestors and cultural belongings. California passed a similar law, the California Native American Graves Protection Act of 2001. 
Yet decades later, too little has been returned to tribes, and some institutions still resist, saying the items are needed for education or research.
I’ve worked in museums and universities for 25 years as a curator and collections manager. I’ve seen how cultural collections are treated. 
Museums only display about 1% of their collections; the rest is hoarded away in substandard storage. Universities have boxes of artifacts that haven’t been opened or studied since they were first collected.

Jeannine Pedersen-Guzmán 
I often had to fight for the basic care of collections. My concerns were ignored. I worked in storage rooms with leaking pipes. I’ve removed cultural materials from mold-infested containers. And I’ve tried organizing a warehouse of 5,000 boxes of archaeological material that had been ignored for years. 
At one museum, collections storage was removed from a new building plan, leaving the collection without a proper home.
So why do these places want to keep their collections? Many don’t have the money, interest or cultural knowledge to care for them. Most of the public will never see these things. 
And how can scientists understand this material if they don’t work with tribes?
Change is afoot. New rules for the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act passed last year. They make things clearer, remove roadblocks and require tribes to be consulted before items are shown or studied. 
Some scholars feel the changes are a threat to knowledge, but they are long overdue.
Today, repatriation doesn’t always mean removing items. Sometimes tribes work with museums and universities through “hold-in-trust” agreements. This means the institution keeps the items, but the tribe has legal control and decides how their cultural heritage is used or shared.
Each tribe has different views: Some are okay with display and research; others are not. Some items can be used for teaching; others cannot. It is about pausing to ask, listen and ideally work together.
Tribes are saying: “Nothing about us, without us.” They want to tell their own stories but are also willing to collaborate. It is here that knowledge can be transformed.
After the new regulations passed, many museums reassessed their Native American galleries. They are now actively consulting with tribes to tell authentic stories through Indigenous voices and perspectives.
The law also has led to more community-based archaeology. For example, in 2018, during the construction of their new museum in Palm Springs, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians halted work after noticing a patch of dark soil. 
Thousands of artifacts were unearthed, and archaeologists helped identify the site as the oldest in the Coachella Valley. The tribe published a book about the discovery and now shares the story in their museum.
After years of trying to improve collections care, I chose to leave museums and universities, to help Native American tribes bring their ancestors and cultural items home. Today, I find meaning in watching tribal citizens connect with returned cultural items or helping rebury an ancestor held in storage for 100 years.
In my heart, I know this is the right thing to do. I hope as the new federal administration sets its priorities, this bedrock law remains in place.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/041424_Native-American-Exhibit_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-24 08:56:35.517697
,California,2025-11-24 13:25:00+00:00,CalMatters,The state found red flags in nursing homes but licensed them anyway. 4 things to know,Jocelyn Wiener,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/11/nursing-home-takeaways/,CalMatters recently reported on a cluster of lawsuits against nursing homes owned by Los Angeles entrepreneur Shlomo Rechnitz. Here are takeaways from our special report.,"In summary
CalMatters recently reported on a cluster of lawsuits against nursing homes owned by Los Angeles entrepreneur Shlomo Rechnitz. Here are takeaways from our special report.


The chain of California nursing homes owned by Shlomo Rechnitz and his companies has faced state scrutiny for years. Now, a series of recent lawsuits is bringing renewed attention to his companies. 
Elder care advocates say Rechnitz’ companies are Exhibit A in how regulators at the Department of Public Health are failing some of California’s most vulnerable citizens.  
In 2021, a CalMatters investigation documented that the state Department of Public Health allowed Rechnitz and his companies to operate 18 nursing homes while delaying a decision on granting licenses to them. The state had kept the license applications in a “pending” status for seven years after he acquired them. Rechnitz and his companies were allowed to continue operating five additional homes even after the state denied licenses to them. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law meant to address the issue, but state regulators in 2023 granted Rechnitz’ companies the licenses to operate the homes just before the measure took effect.
Here are key takeaways from CalMatters’ most recent coverage:
Newly licensed homes now subjects of patient lawsuits
Several homes that received licenses in 2023 are now being sued by patients and their family members. 
In February 2024, a Los Angeles County jury awarded $2.34 million to an 84-year-old nursing home resident named Betsy Jentz, finding that Country Villa Wilshire had violated her rights on 132 occasions, at times leading to serious injuries.
This coming February, a jury in Shasta County is scheduled to hear a case against Windsor Redding, which is accused of negligence in the 2020 COVID-19 deaths of 24 patients. 
Another upcoming case involves 78-year-old Barbara Pendley, who allegedly died after suffering severe dehydration at North Point Healthcare & Wellness Centre in Fresno. 
And trial is scheduled to begin next spring in the case of a 79-year-old dementia patient, referred to as Cheryl Doe, who was allegedly raped twice at Windsor Healthcare Center of Oakland; a second case against the same facility alleges that excessive sedation of 64-year-old Alando Williams led to his death.
Rechnitz and his companies have denied allegations in all of these cases. 
“It is accurate that nursing homes are the target of abusive lawsuits that accomplish nothing but depleting resources for patient care,” said Mark Johnson, an attorney for the facilities and their holding company, Brius.
On average, more citations at Rechnitz homes
A CalMatters analysis of data from both the state health department and the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services found 78 California facilities in which Shlomo Rechnitz or his wife, Tamar, were listed among the owners. On average the facilities fared poorly on several key quality metrics compared to the state overall. 

In the past three years, these 78 nursing homes received an average of 12.4 citations for facility-reported incidents, compared with 6.1 for all nursing homes statewide.
A higher proportion of the facilities has received a federal fine in the last three years than the state’s overall rate. Two-thirds of these facilities received at least one federal fine in the last three years, compared to half of all facilities across the state.
The facilities have been fined an average of $47,897 during the last three years, compared to an average of $29,573 for all California facilities.

Johnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, said in his email that a large percentage of these facilities are located in Los Angeles County, which issues deficiencies at a higher rate than any county in California, many of which are overturned on appeal.
He also said that “Mr. Rechnitz’s facilities self-report at a significantly higher rate than other comparable facilities,” which, in turn, could lead them to have a higher number of deficiencies.
Rechnitz is wealthy
In August 2024, an Alameda County jury found that Alameda Healthcare & Wellness had violated the rights of  71-year-old James Doherty, Sr. more than 1,400 times. That included seven instances in which staff failed to transport him, causing him to miss chemotherapy treatments, court documents said. Doherty died following the development of a large pressure sore. His family was awarded $7.6 million.
Another key revelation from that case: Rechnitz and his wife disclosed their net worth. According to financial documents filed in court, it comes to $786 million. 
Tony Chicotel, a senior staff attorney for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said that dollar figure hasn’t been divulged publicly before.
 “At least in some of these chains, the money that was meant to go for patient care is being stripped away and sent up top to the ownership,” he said.
Advocates say the state is not doing its job
Elder care advocates say the state Department of Public Health could push for greater accountability, including withholding licenses from owners they deem to be bad actors.
Wendy York, a Sacramento attorney specializing in nursing home abuse, said that watching elderly and disabled residents repeatedly suffer the same types of injuries in these facilities “feels like a broken record. It feels like Groundhog Day.”
There are “government agencies who are responsible for their oversight,” York said, but “at the end of the day, it feels like we’re the ones who are doing the enforcement.”
Department of Public Health spokesman Mark Smith said in an emailed statement that the department “remains committed to transparency and accountability for all providers, and to the health and safety of all nursing home residents in California.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/102525_NursingHomeEmpire_FM_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-24 08:56:35.517697

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker has pre-filed a bill for the 2026 legislative session that would require those convicted of rape and incest that results in a pregnancy to get a vasectomy or be castrated.
HB 46, sponsored by Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, would also allow a mother to get an abortion under the same circumstances. Givan said in an interview Wednesday that the bill is more about the broader conversation of bodily autonomy.
“We have already set a double standard,” Givan said. “Have you seen a bill crafted that tells a man what he cannot, what he can’t and cannot do with his body? You have not, outside of the standard laws that speaks to rape and incest, and we already know that that is definitely a crime.”

Robin Marty, a longtime abortion advocate and executive director of a clinic that was once Alabama’s largest abortion provider, opposes the bill.
“As somebody who spends all of her time helping people access reproductive health care, It is just as terrible to create a bill that would take away the reproductive autonomy of a man as it is to have no abortion allowed for a person who can become pregnant,” Marty said in an interview Wednesday afternoon.
In 2020, Rep. Rolanda Hollis, D-Birmingham, sponsored legislation that would require a man to get a vasectomy within a month of his 50th birthday or the birth of his third biological child. It was not considered. The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union opposed the legislation, though it did not cite a specific reason for opposition.
ACLU referred comments to the Southern Poverty Law Center, who did not have an expert available. 
Givan’s bill would apply the punishment regardless of the defendant’s age. She said that there needs to be more accountability on those convicted of sex crimes.
“If we can certainly tell a woman what to do with her body, then we should be able to tell a man he should be held accountable for what he does with his,” Givan said. 
Marty agreed with Givan’s sentiment on accountability, but said that can’t be achieved by causing more harm.
“That’s not a wrong that can be fixed by saying ‘here, look, we’re going to harm you as well,’” Marty said.

Trump is constitutionally prohibited from running for reelection in 2028. (Photo posted on Trump's Truth Social account)As the United States approaches its 250th birthday, the tethers that bind it to the principles of democracy, enshrined in the Constitution by its founders, are being tested in unprecedented fashion. President Donald Trump, wielding power in a manner “like no one has ever seen” as the president likes to say, is riding roughshod over the tenets that have come to define the nation. 
Some of Trump’s acts, such as eviscerating cultural and civic norms – rewriting history by editing exhibits at the Smithsonian Museum, commandeering the Kennedy Center Honors, and holding a cage match at the White House to celebrate a national milestone – are extreme, though not illegal. 
Others, such as demanding voter rolls from states, seeking the prosecution of political enemies, and unilaterally raising taxes on Americans via tariffs, appear to violate the law.
Less than a year into his second term, Trump has: 

Issued false emergency declarations in order to deploy military troops to Los Angeles, and the National Guard to Washington, D.C., Memphis, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon;
violated federal law at least six times by withholding funding previously authorized by Congress;
called for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials to disobey illegal orders, calling it ““SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” on his social media platform; and,
welcomed to the White House the Saudi crown prince, who the U.S. found to be responsible for the dismemberment of an American journalist. 

Americans, lulled into complacency by Trump’s “truly masterful flood the zone with shit strategy,” have been slow to awaken to the panoply of threats posed by the president, says UNLV Associate Professor of Political Science, Rebecca Gill. “It is just too much for any one person to keep track of the ways in which this administration is flat out violating laws.”
The resulting exhaustion and complacency have invoked the metaphor of the frog who remains in gradually heating water, unaware of its impending doom. 
“Many Americans — including people in positions of power — remain far too complacent about the threat,” the New York Times wrote in an opinion piece. 
An assessment of America’s journey toward autocracy from the Steady State, a group of more than 300 former intelligence officials who once trained their expert eyes on foreign regimes, finds “unmistakable warning signs at home.” 
The report concludes that “absent organized resistance” the United States “is likely to continue along a path of accelerating democratic erosion, risking further consolidation of executive dominance and a loss of credibility as a model of democracy abroad.”
Pathway to autocracy
“Countries that slide from democracy toward autocracy tend to follow similar patterns,” says the New York Times piece that gauges whether democracy is eroding in America, based on a dozen markers. “The sobering reality is that the United States has regressed, to different degrees, on all 12.” America is “still not close to being a true autocracy, in the mold of Russia or China. But once countries begin taking steps away from democracy, the march often continues.” 
The Steady State analysis identifies five trends that indicate America is moving toward autocracy. 
The first is the consolidation of executive overreach “through governance by decree and weaponization of the state, combining sweeping executive orders and expansive emergency claims with politicized control of the civil service and oversight bodies, the targeting of perceived opponents via justice and intelligence functions, and preferential protection of allies.”
Trump has publicly directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute political foes, including former FBI chief James Comey, former National Security Advisor John Bolton, and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

“He is attempting to put people in jail for either prosecuting him or for defecting against him,” says Gill of UNLV. “The big targets are either people who attempted to hold him accountable legally, or they are current or former Republicans. He is much more willing than most to go very hard on co-partisans that betray him.”
Retired Nevada Supreme Court Justice Michael Cherry says he’s not convinced the president is targeting political foes. 
“What he went through when they indicted him on all this stuff. It’s tough. Who knows? He’s a human being,” Cherry said during an interview. “He’s got constitutional rights, not only as a human being, but as the president. I don’t know. That’s up to the courts.”
Cherry notes that James “ran on ‘I’m going to prosecute Trump.’ And she did, and now he responds with ‘Well, I’m going to get Letitia and some others.’ So it’s a tough question.”
Federal and state prosecutors have resigned in protest or been fired for refusing to do Trump’s bidding. 
On Wednesday, Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s former personal attorney who was handpicked by the president to charge Comey when other prosecutors declined, was grilled by a judge regarding her failure to follow basic criminal procedures in procuring an indictment against Comey. 
Comey and James, who is also being prosecuted by Halligan, argue that her appointment violates the law. 
Federal judge rules Chattah is ineligible as Acting U.S. attorney to prosecute cases

A similar issue plagues Trump’s Nevada appointee, Sigal Chattah, who has remained in office, jeopardizing prosecutions, even though her appointment as U.S. attorney expired in July. 
Trump has doled out commutations and pardons, based more on fealty than merit. He commuted the sentence of former Congressman George Santos, noting that in the House, he voted Republican. He has not ruled out pardons for Jeffrey Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who vouched for Trump’s gentlemanly behavior, or former acquaintance and convicted domestic abuser Sean Combs. 
On his first day in office this year, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 Jan. 6 insurrectionists.
The president granted federal pardons to Nevada’s fake electors, although they faced no federal charges.
Also on his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order declaring there are two sexes.
“They’re building a society without transgender people,” says Rockathena Brittain, a transgender woman. “This was all done in Nazi Germany. They’re saying ‘hey, you’re stuck with the gender assigned at birth.” 
The Trump administration, she says, “has restricted our existence. It’s untethered from reality, and terrifying when you think of the implications.” 
A compliant court
Another sign of eroding democracy, according to the Steady State, is the erosion of judicial independence, “not only through partisan appointments, but through strategic reliance on the Supreme Court’s ‘shadow docket,’ efforts to curtail judicial remedies and intimidate the legal profession, and selective compliance with court rulings.”
The Supreme Court’s ‘shadow docket’ consists of rulings on motions for emergency relief from lower court rulings. They are necessary, says Gill, to accommodate true emergencies, such as a stay of execution. 
“The cases getting decided are no longer emergencies, at least not in any recognizable sense,” says Gill. “The administration has essentially turned this necessary emergency provision into a back door it can use to get lower courts to back off and to violate the law for a little bit longer.”
Gill says she’s most concerned about cases such as the one involving birthright citizenship, in which the courts are “precluding states from protecting these rights.” 
In the court’s  2024/2025 session, the shadow docket “swallowed the Court, both in terms of workload and even practical importance,” says former Solicitor General Gregory G. Garre.
“Precedent allows us to keep stability and predictability in the law,” Gill notes, adding the justices have substituted their own interpretation of the Constitution, which she says is “a very disingenuous way to read something into it like presidential immunity of the scope that they provided. It just isn’t there.”
“Our emergency docket should never be used, as it has been this year, to permit what our own precedent bars,” Justice Elana Kagan wrote in a dissent in September to the president’s effort to fire federal regulators without cause. “Still more, it should not be used, as it also has been, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President, and thus to reshape the Nation’s separation of powers.”
Shadow docket rulings have enabled the deportation of migrants without due process; racial targeting by law enforcement; access to citizen’s confidential data; the elimination of $4 billion in foreign aid, which is resulting in a resurgence of terror; the rejection of transgender individuals from the military; the mass termination of federal employees; and the removal of Democrats from regulatory boards and commissions. 
“Perhaps the degradation of our rule-of-law regime would happen anyway,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in July. “But this Court’s complicity in the creation of a culture of disdain for lower courts, their rulings, and the law (as they interpret it) will surely hasten the downfall of our governing institutions, enabling our collective demise.”
The Supreme Court has ultimate responsibility to uphold constitutional checks and balances on Trump. Gill is skeptical about the court’s ability to hold the line, citing its presidential immunity ruling and what she calls the shadow docket’s misuse. 
Cherry says the shadow docket is not a burden on lower courts. “They’re not final decisions. They’re waiting to have sufficient briefing and argument on these issues, and I would assume that Trump’s going to win some and lose some. That’s what always happens,” he said. 
“While the orders are technically temporary, they have had broad practical effects, allowing the administration to deport tens of thousands of people, discharge transgender military service members, fire thousands of government workers and slash federal spending,” the NYT wrote in October.
Coequal branch?
The third sign that democracy is threatened is Congress’ abdication of its responsibility, resulting in a diminished capacity “to serve as a coequal branch, as delegation, obstruction, and polarization undermine effective oversight,” says the Steady State’s report.
Last week, the House and the Senate voted nearly unanimously to release investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein, after months of Republican efforts to keep the files confidential. The about-face came just days after Trump, who called the effort to release the files “a hoax.” gave Republicans permission to do so. The Epstein saga illustrates the impotence of Republican lawmakers who are beholden, out of loyalty or fear, to Trump’s edicts, some contend. 
Democrats, on the other hand, have waffled between vows to hold Trump and his acolytes accountable, and what critics call feeble efforts to appear bipartisan. 
Congress has been mostly silent as Americans drown in debt exacerbated by Trump’s tariffs, and face the loss of health insurance, thanks to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill. 
Bedrock of democracy
The fourth sign of eroding democracy, the Steady State writes, is the makeover of the electoral system by restricting voting, gerrymandering, contesting elections, and “undermining the expectation that elections will be fairly run and their outcomes accepted.”
Trump, who has long complained of rigged elections, attempted to squeeze a few more  Republican House members out of Texas by having congressional districts redrawn. The effort hit a wall last week when a judicial panel blocked the move, finding the maps were “racially gerrymandered.” 
The strategy could now backfire on Trump, as California voters gave that state their blessing to redraw districts to counter the threat posed by Texas.
In March, Trump issued an executive order requiring states to turn over their voter rolls to the Department of Justice, ostensibly in an effort to expose those registered in multiple states. 
In July, Nevada provided a version of its statewide voter registration list that is generally available to the public. In August, the Civil Rights Division again requested full access to Nevada’s complete statewide voter registration list, including sensitive personal information.
Forever obsessed with his 2020 loss, Trump’s trying to bigfoot all over Nevada’s election system

The next month, Nevada responded that it would conduct an analysis of the legal authority for the government’s request.  In September, Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar refused to share the complete voter registration list, contending the DOJ request was unjustified. 
“The DOJ has authority to ensure states have proper registration procedures and programs to ensure clean voter roles,” says Eileen O’Connor, a former attorney in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and an expert for the Brennan Center, which is tracking states’ responses to the DOJ request. “I would say that sweeping up all of the voter rolls around the country far exceeds its authority.” 
Voter rolls, she says, provide a snapshot that is outdated before it could be of use to track down fraudulent registration.  The federal government “is attempting to play a role that it does not have and is not permitted to have, in running elections. This appears to be a concerted effort on the part of the current administration to sort of take over federal elections.”
Trump, who has floated the prospect of seeking a third term, even as he acknowledges he can’t, has made his tolerance for election interference apparent by pardoning the insurrectionists who rioted to keep him in the White House after his 2020 defeat. 
“Quiet, piggy.”
America’s greatest threat, Trump has repeatedly asserted, is “the enemy within” – non-adherents who are either Democrats, wayward Republicans, minorities, or LGBTQ+ individuals. He plans to use American cities as a training ground for the U.S. military to address the threat they pose. 
The undermining of public trust and knowledge “through attacks on the press, academia, watchdog institutions, and dissenting voices,” is the final threat identified in the Steady State’s assessment of eroding democracy.  “Together, these trends indicate a restructuring of the constitutional order around personal loyalty rather than adherence to law.”
“The strategy for authoritarianism is to get people to stop looking for the truth,” says Gill. 
“They try to obfuscate so much and tell so many different lies that often contradict each other. People give up believing in a knowable truth.” 
On the first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order restoring freedom of speech and ending federal censorship. Since then, Trump has extorted law firms, universities, and media outlets for speech of which he disapproves. He has decried labels directed at him such as ‘authoritarian’ and ‘fascist’ while declaring hatred for Democrats at a rally and at a memorial service for slain podcaster Charlie Kirk.  
Trump’s tirades are often directed at journalists, who he openly maligns for asking questions. 
Earlier this month, on Air Force One, Trump cut off a Bloomberg News reporter who asked why he had not yet released the Epstein files.
“Quiet, piggy!” the president barked.
Last week, Trump berated an ABC reporter who asked about murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi during the Saudi crown prince’s visit to the Oval Office. Trump deemed her question as “insubordinate” and called ABC a “crappy company,” adding its broadcasting licenses “should be taken away” and that FCC chairman Brendan Carr, who regulates broadcasters “should look at that.” 
Carr is best known for using the language of a mob boss when he said the government could deal with late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel’s monologues about Trump “the easy way or the hard way.” Trump praised Carr’s threat, and said yanking the licenses of networks, who he says are “97% against me,” was up to Carr. 
“What a stupid thing for him to do,” says former Nevada Supreme Court Justice Cherry. “These are business decisions. The government should stay out of this stuff.” 
Last week, Trump called for NBC to fire Seth Meyers. 
While Trump appears to have forgotten his order to end government censorship, Attorney General Bondi was poised earlier this year to “target” Americans for hate speech. Bondi, informed that hate speech is not prohibited in America, backed off. The episode rankled the MAGAverse, as well as Democrats. 
Cherry, a seasoned jurist and a Democrat, finds merit in Bondi’s intention. 
“I’m a proponent of the First Amendment,” he said, adding that as “an American Jew, I’m worried about hate speech. It’s frightening for our kids to be bullied, and hate speech can cause bullying.”
Free speech, he says, should be protected. “But we’ve got to do something about hate speech,” including, he says, from Trump, who he says “gets carried away. It’s got to stop, period. No matter who you are. You’ve got to be kind to your enemies.”

Cracks in the foundation
By his own admission, Trump could “shoot somebody” and get away with it, or assault a woman by grabbing her genitals, because “when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.” 
Trump, during his first term, and even more so in his second, has bathed in the warm waters of infallibility, extending the duration of his self-proclaimed dictatorship from its designated first-day to its 11th month.  
Congress and the Supreme Court, critics contend, have abandoned checks and balances in favor of furthering Trump’s agenda. But in recent weeks, chinks have appeared in the president’s armor. 
Last month, the long-silent Senate voiced disapproval of Trump’s tariffs in a series of votes. 
Trump’s use of his power to enrich himself, his family and friends is also grating on some Republicans, as is his penchant for living in luxury, even in the people’s house, where he took a wrecking ball to the East Wing to make way for an extravagant ballroom, and remodeled the Lincoln bathroom in marble and gold. 
Last week, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Trump’s fiercest defenders until now, apologized for “toxic” political behavior, called out Trump for falsehoods after he called her a traitor, and on Friday announced she was quitting Congress in January. “I refuse to be a battred wife,” she said, referring to Trump’s tirades. 
The break up preceded Trump’s capitulation on releasing the Epstein files. A majority of Republicans disagree with Trump’s handling of the issue, a rare instance in the MAGA world. By contrast, a majority of Republicans supported Trump’s handling of the Jan. 6 insurrection. 
Trump contends he is operating within the confines of the Constitution to carry out the will of those who elected him. Recent polls, however, indicate an increasing awareness and rejection of the president’s penchant for exceeding his authority. 
Even the Supreme Court, which empowered Trump with an unprecedented declaration of immunity, and has indulged his efforts to test the bounds of his authority, is signaling skepticism of the president’s authority to impose tariffs absent congressional approval.
Trump’s power grab could emerge as an issue in the midterms, when Gov. Joe Lombardo will be on the ballot. An Emerson College Polling survey indicates Trump’s approval rating in Nevada is 39%, and his disapproval rating is 54%,leaving the president with a net approval rating of -15. 
Lombardo announces reelection campaign, warns against a Democrat in power 

Lombardo gushed this month after receiving a second endorsement from Trump. His campaign did not respond when asked whether Nevadans’ concerns about Trump could cut into Lombardo’s votes. 
Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat who has joined attorneys general from blue states in filing 36 lawsuits against the Trump administration, is hoping to unseat Lombardo. 
Lombardo and Trump, he said in a statement “are Nevada’s biggest roadblocks to affordability. I will always put Nevada families first. That’s why I have sued both the Trump and Biden administrations and am fighting to lower costs and make Nevada more affordable.”
Washoe County Commission Chairwoman Alexis Hill, who is running in the Democratic primary against Ford, says the governor’s veto of a bill that would have allowed for open primaries is in line with Trump’s efforts to disenfranchise voters. 
“That’s 38% of the electorate,” she said. “He’s essentially saying that they can’t participate in the democracy of Nevada.” Voters rejected a similar measure last year. 
Hill says Nevadans she encounters are “worried about ensuring that we uphold democratic ideals, but are also worried about livability and affordability.” 
Trump, following Democratic election wins this month, retrieved from the back burner his own campaign promise to bring down prices. “The new word is ‘affordability,” he said during an Oval Office meeting Friday with New York Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani. Last week he hailed McDonald’s as a symbol of American affordability, and proclaimed he’s “normalized” inflation.
Trump’s end game is unknown, and may depend on the alacrity of a citizenry that is largely bleary-eyed and overwhelmed. The demise of authoritarian regimes, experts say, most often result from military defeat, economic collapse, or resistance movements that offer an alternative and capitalize on unrest.
Americans are beginning to notice the erosion of democracy as it “starts to impact their everyday lives in ways that they can’t rationalize, particularly when they cannot assign the blame anywhere else,” says Gill.  “Masked federal agents are kidnapping folks off the street. Citizenship doesn’t matter. We’re handing people over to terrorist prison camps in other countries with no due process. A lot of people have woken up to this.”
Turning that awakening into a movement could be challenging, she says.
Trump’s team “has done its homework” and studied similar transitions, like those involving Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and Hungary’s Viktor Orban. “They have started to gobble up alternative and mainstream media. They’ve essentially gone to war against any source of truth.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trump2028-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-24 08:56:35.517697

I hadn’t read either before. But I knew the broad strokes of the stories. Gilgamesh is the tale of a Mesopotamian king and demigod who befriends a wild man; sees and grieves the wild man’s death and begins a quest for immortality. The surprise for a modern reader (in Sophus Helle’s translation) is that Gilgamesh is clearly a tyrant and sexual abuser, even by the standards of the third millennium B.C.
Like the best poetry, you can find different meanings in the verses. You have a powerful man reaching his limits. And a thug getting his comeuppance. But either way, Gilgamesh learns there are boundaries not even the most ruthless can cross.

I also knew the arc of Beowulf. Monster eats Danes; Superstrong Dane meets Monster; Monster loses arm, etc. But I didn’t expect the poem to be so somber.
Beowulf flexes his might against beasts and dragons, but in front of a backdrop of loss and decay. The work ends not in triumph, but with a funeral, and Beowulf’s people mourning his death.  It’s an unsettling ending. Monsters are inevitable. Heroes are not.
But maybe subconsciously I’ve been drawn to these stories of powerful people encountering restraints. Just look around. Neither the law nor common decency seem to be holding our elites back these days.
Nor can I shake a sense of decline. Last year, I wondered where we would be on Thanksgiving 2025, as a new administration committed to attacking immigrants, gutting health care and undermining democracy took shape.
So, with the holiday near, let’s take stock of Alabama.
Our leaders and institutions, like many around the country, have all but knuckled under. No one should ever expect courage from this state’s congressional delegation. But the Republican members’ grovelling to this administration stands out.
It would be bad enough if all we had were their smiles at the terror unleashed on immigrants. But they’ve also kept their peace — and sometimes cheered — as Trump has pursued a trade policy ruinous to Alabama farms and businesses.
Gov. Kay Ivey has supported Trump’s efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, which feeds thousands of Alabama school children every day. The entire GOP leadership seems indifferent to the soaring price of health insurance, which leaves hundreds of thousands of Alabamians at risk of losing it entirely.
Our two flagship universities have been notably craven. The University of Alabama sat on its hands this spring as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents kidnapped Alireza Douroudi, a graduate student from Iran studying engineering, and left him to suffer in a Louisiana prison.
Auburn University fired multiple employees this September for alleged insensitivity to the killing of far-right activist Charlie Kirk. This concern for civility did not prevent Auburn from welcoming far-right U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville to campus, a man who has called city dwellers “rats” and immigrants “garbage,” and also claimed that Black Americans “do the crime.”
All this weakness would be enough to make one despair.
But then we see the courage of individual Alabamians.
Families of immigrants fight for their loved ones, often at great personal risk, against a system that does nothing but create suffering.
Librarians continue to battle for our right to read books in the face of official fearmongering and censorship.
And there are Alabamians who come out for their values. Whether they’re crowding a room to stick up for public broadcasting or gathering by the thousands in the name of democracy.
It reminds me of another poem I’ve read recently, by the early 19th century Irish bard Antaine Raiftearai. It’s not about immortality or dragons. It’s a long outburst of glee at Raiftearai’s preferred candidate winning a local election. In the middle of dunking on the vanquished, the poet wrote:
Is aimsir an chruatain gur sheas na fíréin. Roughly, “in the time of struggle stood the righteous.”
We will not emerge from this season of hardship because a hero came over the sea to beat someone up. The battles we face are in thousands of ordinary places, over values we once thought moot.
We will save what is good about America when thousands of people will draw lines against authoritarianism in their daily lives and refuse to budge. Democracy and the rule of law will prevail if Alabamians — as they have in the past — stand against those who would destroy both.
So I’m grateful to those who rise to fight, in battles big and small. They alone won’t bring the abuses or the suffering to an immediate halt. But they will put us on a path away from it, toward something better. Something more reflective of who we are.
The fight for democracy is the epic of our time. We see the monsters. And in the people standing for our ideals, we find the heroes.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ALR_NoKings_BHM_101825-34-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-24 08:56:35.517697
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-24 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about CT laws relating to ICE interactions,Christina Lee,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/ct-ice-laws/,CT recently made changes to the laws governing how local and state officials interact with ICE and limiting what ICE can do in the state.,"The Connecticut legislature recently made changes to the laws governing how local and state officials interact with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and limiting what ICE agents can do in the state. The revisions to state law were made in response to residents’ concerns about federal immigration policy. Divided along party lines, state Democrats have worked to address immigrants’ assertions that they are living in fear.
Here’s what you need to know about what ICE can do in Connecticut. 
What changes were made in the latest state legislation?
In November’s special session, state lawmakers passed House Bill 8004 which included sections that limit ICE from making arrests at courthouses. The bill prohibits representatives of a local, state or federal law enforcement authority from arresting people inside state courthouses without a judicial warrant. ICE agents are also not allowed to wear masks on courthouse grounds without a medical requirement. 
There are also measures to protect immigrants’ personal information. State agencies are not allowed to share personal information such as dates and times of court hearings and appointments, home addresses, and workplaces. 
Gov. Ned Lamont signed the bill into law shortly after the special session.
Can Connecticut law enforcement turn immigrants over to ICE?
In 2019, Connecticut lawmakers passed the Trust Act, which specified the grounds on which local and state officials are allowed to turn over unauthorized migrants to ICE. The Act prohibits state law enforcement from arresting individuals solely on the basis of detainers — requests from ICE to hold someone for up to 48 hours so agents can then pick them up. 
Law enforcement officers may comply with detainers only if ICE has a judicial warrant to make an arrest, or if the individual in their custody has been convicted of a class A or B felony, or identified on a terrorist watch list. Class A or B felonies include murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, and first-degree manslaughter. 
The Trust Act was modified in May of this year. Now, individuals can sue cities and towns if the Act is violated. Further, the circumstances under which law enforcement must comply with ICE requests for detainment were expanded to include 13 more crimes and broaden who is considered a law enforcement official. 
What happens when ICE makes an arrest?
While the recent laws intended to make courthouses safer for immigrants in Connecticut, ICE agents can still make arrests in other public areas without a warrant if they have a reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual they are targeting is an unauthorized migrant, as per the Immigration and Nationality Act.
Further, aside from courthouse grounds, there are no laws requiring ICE agents to show their face, or prohibiting masks. This means that ICE agents may still approach an individual in a mask and make an arrest, without a warrant.
How does the state recommend state agencies respond to ICE visits?
In a document from Lamont’s office issued in January, the state provides guidance on how state agencies should handle visits from ICE to comply with state and federal laws while also protecting individuals’ privacy rights. 
The guide instructs state officials to request information on why the ICE agent is making a visit, notify legal counsel, and refrain from sharing any personal information or documents such as immigration status until a legal counsel reviews the request. 
ICE also has limited access to non-public areas. They are prohibited from accessing non-public areas of a state agency building without a judicial warrant. But there is no legislation to limit their movements in public premises of an establishment. For example, an ICE agent could make an unwarranted arrest on a sidewalk outside of the state facility.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP-ice-arrest.jpg,,,2025-11-24 07:58:23.423919

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The battle for retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters’s seat in the upper chamber of Congress is gearing up to include at least one potentially messy primary on the Democratic Party side and a potentially bruising fight on the GOP side if a new challenge to the party’s frontrunner causes intra-party friction.
Peters announced in January that he wouldn’t be running for a sixth term in the U.S. Senate, setting up an open seat and race that has invited big money and national attention. Republicans will be fighting tooth and nail to maintain their majority in 2026, and see Michigan as a big opportunity to either hold or expand their grasp on the chamber.
The race is currently rated as a toss-up.
Meanwhile, Democrats, coming off a big sweep of wins this November, are seeing the political tide rising against the administration of President Donald Trump and his most controversial policies affecting immigration, the wars in Israel and Ukraine, proposed new conflicts in Latin America and a failing economy. Holding on to Peters’ seat could be a key piece to standing the party’s ground and potentially taking back control of the upper chamber.
Here’s Michigan Advance’s breakdown of the race thus far, the support each candidate has received and current fundraising totals.
The Democrats
For the Democrats eyeing that prize, a hotly contested primary is on the horizon. In the race are U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, Abdul El-Sayed, former director of the Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services, and research health specialist Rachel Howard.
Stevens has positioned herself as the frontrunner and much of the party’s political machine is supporting her bid for the Senate. But El-Sayed and McMorrow are both on her tail in terms of fundraising. Howard hasn’t gotten the same amount of attention, but could make some waves if she is able to stay in the race down the stretch.

Haley Stevens 
Stevens is the establishment party fixture in the race, and has routinely been noted as one of the most effective Democrats in Washington, D.C. Several top news sources, including Politico, Semafor and Axios, have all noted that she is being privately backed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other top Democrats. That support has not been made public, however, as leadership and the party machine typically holds off boosting its candidates until after the primary.

Stevens has also received large sums of money through the years from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, and it’s likely that the group will spend on her behalf against her opponents. Stevens is one of the stronger pro-Israel Democrats in the U.S. House and now has the backing of the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, or DMFI.
Stevens also has a long list of supporters, from former governors, her colleagues in Michigan; U.S. Reps. Hillary Scholten and Shri Thanedar, several sitting state representatives, the Michigan Black Caucus, UNITE HERE Local 24, UA Local 636 and the Teamsters Local 243.
Campaign finance disclosures in the Federal Election Committee database in the latest October quarterly report shows Stevens is leading the pack with $4.72 million raised, $2.1 million spent and $2.61 million cash on hand.

Mallory McMorrow 
McMorrow made a name for herself standing up to Republicans who have gone after Michigan’s LGBTQ+ community, namely state Sen. Lana Theis of Brighton, who evoked  anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric in a 2022 invocation, which led to a Democratic walkout and criticism of Theis on social media. Theis accused McMorrow and other Democrats of “grooming” for their support for teaching kids about LGBTQ+ issues. 
Theis specifically named McMorrow in a fundraising email, to which McMorrow punched back in a scathing Michigan Senate floor speech. That raised McMorrow’s national profile, and she appeared as a speaker at the Democratic National Convention in 2024.
That helped McMorrow launch her U.S. Senate bid this year, where she has become one of the key alternatives to Stevens for Michigan Democrats seeking to support a less establishment candidate. McMorrow’s support has come from a long list of Michigan state representatives and senators, local officials, UA Local 370, Nurses for America and The Next 50, which supports young Democratic leaders in the making.
Campaign finance disclosures in the Federal Election Committee database in the latest October quarterly report shows McMorrow just behind Stevens with $3.85 million raised, $2.4 million spent and $1.45 million cash on hand.

Abdul El-Sayed 
El-Sayed is the stalwart progressive candidate in the race, a student of the game set in play by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, who regularly champions Medicare for All (of note, El-Sayed wrote a book on the policy). As the son of an Egyptian immigrant, he was also one of the earliest candidates in the race to call the actions of the Israeli government in its war against Hamas and the Palestinian people a genocide, which set him apart from his opponents before McMorrow also landed on the position.
The candidate previously ran for governor in Michigan in 2018, but ultimately lost in the primary to current term-limited Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Following that race, El-Sayed became the director of the Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services, focusing on the wellness of Detroit and its surrounding metropolitan areas.
El-Sayed has the support of Sanders, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Detroit, former Michigan congressman Andy Levin, party fixtures like Keith Ellison, the attorney general of Minnesota, progressive-minded sitting and former state legislators, and some local officials across the state. He’s also garnered the support from a swath of younger voters and key Michigan Democratic Party groups, like its grassroots caucus, the LGBT&A caucus and its progressive caucus.

Campaign finance disclosures in the Federal Election Committee database in the latest October quarterly report show El-Sayed with $3.57 million raised, $1.72 million spent and $1.84 million cash on hand.
Rachel Howard
Howard, who hails herself as a non-politican, is a combat veteran with the Michigan National Guard who was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and a clinical researcher at Henry Ford Health. There has been no significant polling showing Howard in matchups against the others in the primary. She has raised $10,937 thus far, spent $6,171 and has $4,766 cash on hand.
Her policy positions appear to be that of a more moderate choice, like Stevens, in the race. She supports both Israel and Palestine in the conflict but said that while she backs peaceful coexistence, she does not support the Israeli government’s actions that have harmed civilians. She believes Ukraine has a right to its sovereignty. 
She believes abortion decisions should be between a patient and their doctor, but also has said reducing the need for abortions by addressing root causes was necessary. She also strongly supports the Second Amendment but would fight gun violence through safe storage laws, background checks, violence prevention and training. She supports a single payer healthcare system, much like McMorrow.
Howard has also called for banning corporate donations and keeping big money out of politics. 
The Republicans
Republicans in the state party and on the national scene have by and large thrown their weight behind former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake, who has been endorsed by Trump, has money of his own to invest and is seeing the donor class rally around him. 
But his apparent coronation before primary season really begins could face some speed bumps. 
His biggest potential rival, if she can make the ballot and pull away grassroots voters, is former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Bernadette Smith, who resigned from the party earlier this month and officially launched her candidacy on Thursday. It is unlikely that Smith can pull away Trump World from Rogers, but if he seems vulnerable, things could change. Aside from Smith, dentist Kent Benham and activist Geneieve Scott are also eyeing to take down Rogers in the primary, but their chances are slim.

Mike Rogers 
Rogers is a well-known and battle-ready commodity in Michigan Republican politics. From 2001 to 2015, he represented his mid-Michigan district for seven terms, including ascending to the powerful chair of the House Intelligence Committee. In 2024, he sought to replace former U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Lansing when she decided to retire after a 24-year career in the upper chamber.
Rogers received strong support from Republicans in the 2024 primary with 60% of the vote and Trump’s endorsement, but he ultimately lost to current U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Holly in the general election. A year after his defeat, Rogers is back to try and claim a Senate seat and balance the scales after the Democrats have held both Senate seats since 2001.
Rogers strongly supports Israel, abortion policies left up to states and not federal mandate or law, and Trump’s tariff and immigration policies. He opposed key LGBTQ+ rights issues including allowing transgender girls to play in girl’s sports. He has the backing of key U.S. Senate Republican leaders like Majority Leader John Thune, several sitting state lawmakers, local officials, Americans for Prosperity and Associated Builders and Contractors.
Rogers and Slotkin slug it out on Social Security, guns, EVs and abortion in final debate 

Rogers has raised $3.41 million thus far, spent just $966,939 and has a whopping $2.7 million cash on hand.
Bernadette Smith 
Smith’s candidacy comes late to the race, and some have questioned whether she has the infrastructure, money or ability to make the ballot in order to be a player in the primary against Rogers. But with some within the party questioning whether Rogers could win against someone like McMorrow or Stevens, Smith could see an opportunity to make his race to the top a bit more difficult.
Since her campaign was launched Thursday, there is no polling that includes her and she has not had to submit any financial disclosures. She will, soon, however, and that could give Republican voters a better look at who is backing her and if she came to play.
Smith is a tried and true devotee to Trump and has links to Turning Point USA. She spoke at the party’s Capitol-lawn rally for the slain Charlie Kirk following his assassination in September.

Kent Benham 
A view into Benham’s policy positions background other than his dental practice are hard to come by. He does not have a campaign website; his only presence is a personal Facebook page that features his practice.
The FEC does not have any campaign finance data listed for him in its system.
Genevieve Scott 
Scott is a Republican activist who was prominent in the “Stop the Steal” movement furthering the 2020 election conspiracy that claimed, without evidence, that Trump won despite former President Joe Biden’s clear victory.
She also reportedly attended the rallies that led up to the January 6, 2021 riot and insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol building. Scott urged people to enter the Capitol, Michigan Public reported, but there was no evidence that she actually entered the Capitol during the chaotic event.
She has adopted a Trump-inspired “America First” policy platform, with a focus on promoting American excellence in schools, election integrity and has a “waste, fraud and abuse” mantra that runs like a current through the modern Republican Party in the era of Trump.
Scott has raised $35,544, spent nearly all of that to the tune of $30,636 and has $4,908, a massive burn rate for a candidate with limited funds.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/capitolatnight-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-24 07:58:23.423919

Benjie Wimberly (D-Passaic) said that as the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids has escalated in the last 10 months, he’s concerned both about the fear masked agents have instilled in communities with undocumented residents and the danger of criminals using masks to impersonate ICE agents.
“I’m sure somebody is working on a scheme right now about how they can rob some place, posed as ICE agents,” said Wimberly. “It’s very scary times.”

Since President Donald Trump took office and executed his campaign promise of mass detention and deportation, some immigration agents have shown up at schools, businesses, and courts with their faces covered and wearing no identification. It’s a tactic lawmakers said they haven’t seen under previous administrations.
Wimberly’s bill, introduced earlier this month, would bar any law enforcement officer who is interacting with the public from wearing a mask or disguise. Officers who are working undercover, wearing a shield that does not conceal their face, or wearing a medical mask would not be subject to the bill.
Officers who violate the provisions would face fines of $500 to $1,000, prison for up to six months, or both.
Sherrill, a Democrat, said during her campaign for the state’s top job this year that she supports banning police from wearing masks and requiring that they identify themselves during enforcement operations. A Sherrill spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the bill.
She’s told stories of ICE agents looking like they’re “dressed for Afghanistan” who refuse to identify themselves, calling it “unacceptable.”
“We need to know who is on our streets here in New Jersey,” she said at a campaign stop in Newark last month.
California passed a bill in September that bars law enforcement officers from wearing most masks while carrying out their duties. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state over the law last week, calling it an unconstitutional attempt to regulate federal agents.
Lawmakers in several other states, including Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, have introduced similar legislation.
The Trump administration has defended ICE agents for masking, claiming agents who show their faces during enforcement operations are harassed and doxed online. A U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on ICE’s mask policy, though a spokeswoman has previously said it would “not abide by a state’s unconstitutional ban.”
Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (D-Mercer), prime sponsor of the bill in the lower chamber, said the measure protects law enforcement officers by “honoring the person behind the uniform and the badge.”
“We want people to trust police officers. Police officers are supposed to be trusted people in the community,” she said. “You can’t do that if others are coming in under the cloak of protection and they’re really just undermining people’s basic human rights.”
While the bill would also prevent state, county, and local law enforcement from obstructing their faces while interacting with the public, lawmakers agree they’re more focused on getting ICE agents to stop masking.
Ron Chen, a professor of law and former dean of Rutgers Law School, told the New Jersey Monitor last month that a state law banning ICE agents from wearing masks would likely be struck down by courts because states are barred from regulating the federal government.
Wimberly conceded that a court challenge against the measure would be likely if it is signed into law.
“My hope is that, for where we’re at in America, I think we can create a template that should go across every state in America,” Wimberly said.

Every new classroom that opens needs a qualified early childhood educator to lead it.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Heather Duhamel and Kaitlin Northey: Vermont must protect and strengthen the programs that prepare early childhood educators.","This commentary is by Heather Duhamel and Kaitlin Northey. Duhamel is assistant professor and program director for early childhood education online at Vermont State University and higher education outreach coordinator for the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children. Northey is associate professor of early childhood education at the University of Vermont.


The future of Vermont’s child care system depends on access to early childhood teacher education programs, clear and connected preparation pathways, and support for higher ed students to complete them.
Vermont’s child care future depends on the strength of its early childhood education workforce. We’ve made historic gains in expanding access for families, but the system still needs more well-prepared early childhood educators to give our youngest children the best possible start. 
Building a strong child care workforce starts with educating the early childhood educators. Long before caring for your child, your family’s trusted early childhood educator was training to teach young children.
Across Vermont, future educators begin their journeys in high schools, career and technical education programs, apprenticeships, community colleges, certificate programs and universities. This variety is a strength, reflecting the many ways people enter higher ed: as students, parents, mid-career changers and lifelong learners.
And these programs are popular — more high school students are taking ECE courses for college credit, and early childhood education courses are among the highest enrolled at Community College of Vermont.
In our work as teacher educators, we see every day how much these programs strengthen our workforce, and why it’s important to stabilize them in uncertain times. We also see where students stop their studies, and how we can help them continue.
The Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children recently released the first higher ed landscape study since 2017. The report, Higher Ed Pathways, Challenges, and Opportunities for Vermont’s Early Childhood Education Workforce, was researched and written by Heather. 
Her research finds that students need to see connections between today’s coursework, tomorrow’s credential, and how continuing their studies impacts their compensation and career.
There are many ways for early childhood educators to enter higher ed, but many stop credit-bearing coursework after two courses, or six credits. This pattern extends beyond early childhood education, yet because our intro classes are so popular, we have specific opportunities to retain students.
And this is important because Vermont needs more well-prepared early childhood educators. As a state, we’ve invested in helping families afford child care and expanding program access. But every new classroom that opens needs a qualified early childhood educator to lead it.
Institutions are adapting. Flexible scheduling, credit for prior learning and clearer advising tools all help ECEs continue their own education — especially the many who do coursework while working full-time. State investments in scholarships, apprenticeship programs and student loan repayment assistance for early childhood educators are crucial supports.
Yet bachelor’s and graduate-level programs remain fragile. Over the past 10 years, Vermont has lost several early childhood preparation programs, and faculty across the state told us that higher ed institutions are now making changes or reductions to programs in an effort to navigate federal funding uncertainties. 
Federal policy adds urgency. The 2025 national budget reconciliation bill introduced restrictions on federal student loan access for “low-earning” majors. Without action, many students could lose the very loans that make their education possible, jeopardizing both higher education programs and Vermont’s child care workforce.
This threat compounds the ongoing challenge of compensation: historically, early childhood educators earn low wages, while the cost of care for very young children remains high. Without public investment, families shoulder tuition costs and educators endure low wages. Vermont is leading the nation in changing this, but educator compensation is still catching up.
Vermont doesn’t have to accept this outcome.
Federal law uses state‑specific earnings thresholds to define “low-earning,” which means that ensuring early childhood educators are paid according to their qualifications — as in other professions — can protect students’ access to federal loans. This approach strengthens higher ed programs and pathways, attracts new students, and makes early childhood education a viable career choice. Ultimately, it supports stronger child care programs and better outcomes for children and families. 
Here’s what we recommend:

Stabilize early childhood education preparation programs at every level, from high school to graduate school, through consistent funding and policy support.
Make transfer agreements and pathway maps visible and easy to use for students, advisors and faculty.
Strengthen coordination between higher ed, workforce and licensing systems so programs and professional standards align.
Link compensation and advancement to preparation and credentials, so education in this field has tangible value.

These are not abstract policy goals; they’re the foundation of the workforce our child care system depends on. 
We’ve seen firsthand that progress happens when Vermont’s educators, higher ed partners and policymakers work together. Advocacy and partnership have already reshaped child care in Vermont. Now we must sustain that momentum by protecting the programs that support early childhood education careers.
We’ve worked hard to build higher ed systems that welcome aspiring and advancing early childhood educators wherever they are in their coursework and career. These systems show real promise. With the right support, they can grow and retain the child care workforce Vermont depends on.

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/24/the-push-to-punish-a-nj-school-board-member-for-facebook-posts-is-foolish/,A Salem County school board member is the target of an ethics complaint for asking her Facebook followers about tax hikes.,"A Salem County school board member is the target of an ethics complaint for asking her Facebook followers about tax hikes. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Why are New Jerseyans barred from hearing from some of their elected leaders about matters of public concern?
That’s the question at the heart of a new lawsuit filed by a school board member out of Alloway in Salem County who is facing ethics charges because she asked constituents on Facebook what they thought of a potential school tax hike.
“As a resident of Alloway, I am wondering what other residents think about a 9-15% school tax increase?” reads one post from the school board member, Gail Nazarene.
“My personal opinion is 3.3% is the max I can afford,” reads part of another.
Pretty milquetoast, if you ask me, especially if you consider the tons of AI slop and nasty political rants you can find on Facebook at any given moment. But they were enough to trigger an ethics investigation, with one of Nazarene’s colleagues filing a complaint with the state School Ethics Commission that says Nazarene’s posts violate the state School Ethics Act. The complaint, from Alloway school board member Sara Cobb, says Nazarene’s Facebook posts reference potential tax hikes that “were not formally reviewed, adopted, or confirmed by the Board.”
“The publication of these figures created confusion and concern among members of the public, and conveyed the impression that Ms. Nazarene was speaking on behalf of the Board without authorization,” it reads.
Cobb also took issue with another Facebook post where Nazarene asked, “I am ASKING this FOR MYSELF NOT the board. What if taxes went up 20% is that a number you will except (sic)?” Cobb wrote that this and other posts “appear to use the prestige of her Board membership to promote a specific budgetary narrative, potentially undermining official communications from the Board or administration.”
You know that old canard “you can’t shout fire in a crowded theater”? Apparently, New Jersey’s version is you can’t potentially undermine the Alloway school district’s communications department.
There’s no state law that explicitly bars school board members from speaking to the public, of course. But the School Ethics Commission has interpreted the School Ethics Act in a way that school board members risk violating it if they discuss any school matters with members of the public, even if they offer disclaimers that they are speaking for themselves as private citizens and even if the issue in question has yet to come before their school board but could at some point in the future. Even posting a link to public information — with no additional commentary — would not immunize a school board member from an ethics investigation, the commission says.
Indeed, the commission has reprimanded school board members for things like writing opinion pieces endorsing other school board candidates or posting on Facebook about school overcrowding. 
Nazarene’s lawyer, Daniel Zahn, said the state’s interpretation of the School Ethics Act plainly violates the First Amendment. Zahn sounded mystified that state bureaucrats would want to limit the type of communication elected officials have with their constituents.
“It seems that for democracy to thrive we should be encouraging posts such as these that are engaging with constituents, asking them questions, respecting different viewpoints, and for the state to threaten sanctions for this type of respectful, powerful communication between elected officials and their constituents not only damages the First Amendment and free speech values, but also damages democracy and broader American values,” Zahn told me.
Anthony “Skip” Cimino has some thoughts on this. Camino represented the 14th Legislative District in the Assembly from 1988 to 1992, and he sponsored the School Ethics Act. Cimino told me he thinks the commission has interpreted the law incorrectly in Nazarene’s case.
“The act was really geared toward dealing with conflicts of interest and, quite frankly, people of ill repute doing things inappropriately,” he said.
Nazarene is an elected official who should have the right to talk to her constituents about school matters without violating the School Ethics Act, he added.
I am not opposed to strong ethics laws. But this is New Jersey. Not too long ago we had a sitting U.S. senator issue a public threat to anyone who dared challenge him at the ballot box. Last year, a state senator told an obvious lie to drum up support for a bill to gut our public records law. The members of our Legislature voted to give themselves gigantic pay raises with almost zero public input or debate. Yet there’s a very real chance a school board member will get an official reprimand from the state for asking people on Facebook what they think about tax increases. This is asinine.

Both retired ferries have been for sale for more than four years. (Photo by Tom Banse for Washington State Standard)If you have ever wanted to own an iconic Washington state ferry, now may be your last chance to buy one until the 2030s. There are two sizes available with no minimum bid — the decommissioned 144-car Hyak and the 87-car Klahowya.
But before you get carried away with dreams of a palatial waterfront fixer-upper, or opening a floating restaurant, or making a quick buck off the scrap metal, be aware of the scrutiny you stand to receive.
“It’s more challenging than most people would have guessed,” said John Vezina, the deputy head of the state ferry system. “We’re not going to sign off on anything that isn’t ironclad that it can work.”
The Hyak and Klahowya have been sitting on the market unsold for more than a year since the state terminated a prior sales contract with an Ecuadorian middleman in summer 2024. 
Businessman Nelson Armas paid $200,000 with the intention of towing his purchases to Ecuador for scrapping. The deal went awry when the hired tugboat could not safely connect to two ferries, among other mishaps. The South American tugboat crew ended up deported.
“It’s incredibly difficult to sell decommissioned vessels,” Vezina said in an interview.
Steps to complete a purchase, he explained, include getting a Coast Guard-approved plan for towing and a Department of Ecology sign-off.
“There is a lot of superficial initial buyer interest,” Vezina said. “Most inquiries don’t go too far.”
Washington State Ferries retired the Hyak and Klahowya after it became too costly to keep them running. The Klahowya is an Evergreen State-class vessel built in 1958. The Hyak was one of four Super-class ferries built in San Diego. It was launched in 1966.
Vezina said maintenance workers have stripped key parts for re-use on other ferries. That makes it more difficult and expensive for any buyer to recertify the two ships for service. The vessels for sale no longer have their navigation gear, radars, radios or lifeboats. Even the Hyak’s horn was removed and reinstalled in Climate Pledge Arena as the goal horn for Seattle Kraken hockey games.

The state ferry system is relying on word of mouth to sell these two retired ferries, unlike in years past when it held public auctions. There is no webpage with details as of yet. Serious shoppers can request marine survey reports. Those 2025 inspections described the two ferries as structurally sound, but in fair to poor overall condition.
Vezina said the agency would like the pair of vessels gone as soon as a suitable buyer can be found. The ferries are taking up valuable space in the ferry system’s Eagle Harbor shipyard. 
Armas and the Ecuadorian steel company are still circling for a second chance to buy the aged boats (or get a refund, in Armas’ case), Vezina said. Washington State Ferries appeared reluctant to do business with them again. 
 Plan B
Leadership at Washington State Ferries has started to contemplate what to do if no viable buyer emerges. 
“If we can’t find anybody to take them off our hands,” said Steve Nevy, head of the state ferry system, “Plan B is to try to look at recycling facilities.”
The trouble with plan B is that there is no established shipbreaking facility nearby for large vessels like this. Additionally, WSF has no money in its budget currently to pay for disposal. The costs of towing, drydock time, labor and hazardous materials handling at a reputable shipbreaking yard likely far exceed the profit to be gained from the scrap metal.
BC Ferries has a similar problem and politicians from Vancouver Island are offering a possible solution. They are proposing that the provincial and federal governments pony up to expand and equip a private shipyard — or shipyards — in Port Alberni to handle large ship deconstruction. Mid-Vancouver Island Member of Parliament Gord Johns said up to 14 British Columbia ferries could be destined for recycling when their replacements enter service over the next decade.
“The 14 vessels that are at end of life will require recycling at a cost of between $10 [million] and $12 million each,” Johns told Nanaimo News Now. “In the case of the Queen of Burnaby [ferry] they’re spending just half of that cost just to tow it through the Panama Canal and up to Halifax where it can be recycled because we don’t have facilities here.”
The potential establishment of the Port Alberni shipbreaking facility to keep the money and jobs close to home comes with a long timeline. Federal and provincial subsidies are needed, and indigenous First Nations must be consulted. It’s unlikely to open in time to recycle the Hyak or Klahowya. But a British Columbia yard could figure into the disposal plans for Washington ferries that retire in the 2030s after the state takes delivery of new hybrid-electric vessels.
Cautionary tales
Anyone who buys a retired ferry in the Pacific Northwest will likely be dogged by the mixed record of successful repurposings, unrealized dreams and past purchasers’ fiascos, agreed Steve Pickens, curator of the ferry history website EvergreenFleet.com.
Sooner or later, the conversation returns to the most famous former Washington state ferry, the streamlined art deco Kalakala, aka “the Silver Slug.” In 1998, the historic ferry was rescued by a preservationist from its second life as a seafood cannery in Alaska. But a series of subsequent owners lacked the wherewithal to restore the Kalakala, leading to many public disputes, further decay and eventual scrapping in 2015.

“Darn that Kalakala,” said Bart Lematta, the third owner of the retired state ferry Evergreen State, during a spicy public discussion with the Port of Bellingham commissioners. Lematta’s ferry is now moored in Bellingham, awaiting conversion to battery-electric propulsion.
The port commissioners displayed mild irritation this past year with Lematta’s slow pace of progress to put the old ferry to a productive use on their waterfront. The 310-foot Evergreen State is a sister ship of the Klahowya that is now for sale. 
Lematta provided perspective on the cost of ownership of a retired ferry. He said moorage at the port pier cost him $72,000 per year and the price of vessel insurance through Lloyds of London was $139,000 annually.
A twin of the Hyak, the bigger ferry also now for sale, recently found a good home at an Everett shipyard. Everett Ship Repair purchased the retired ferry Elwha for $100,000 and converted it into a floating office and storage complex.
Other successful ferry re-use examples include the Hiyu and the Skansonia, which are now party and event venues moored on opposite sides of Seattle’s Lake Union.
The worst case is to see an old ferryboat left to decay on a beach. That’s happened multiple times on Puget Sound and in Alaska.
The former state ferry Olympic was declared a public nuisance by Pierce County as far back as 2010. The elderly owner has broken numerous agreements to remove it. It’s still decaying on his beach on Ketron Island. (Photo by Tom Banse for Washington State Standard)
One ex-captain from Steilacoom even managed to abandon two ferries consecutively in Pierce County, one acquired from Virginia and the other a second-hand purchase of the former state ferry Olympic. Neither of those has budged to this day.
“We don’t want these boats abandoned on Washington beaches,” said the state ferry system’s Vezina, having the Pierce County outcome in mind. “Absolutely.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Klahowya-and-Hyak-ferries-1024x722.jpg,,,2025-11-24 07:58:23.423919

The traveling, the cooking, the shopping, and, of course, the airing of grievances. You — the lucky few — will have the opportunity to share with your loved ones what you’re thankful for this year and what you’re looking forward to in the year to come. It’s Festivus for the rest of us. 
Let’s make it the best one we’ve ever had! When the conversation turns to politics, you could take up where you left off last year.  When exactly did the country start going to hell, and which generation is to blame? It’s a classic, and there’s tradition to it. But of all the Charlie Browns in the world, it’s the Charlie Browniest. 
Instead, try something more productive. Maybe something fun and completely natural, like the merits of competing criminal justice policies. As you pass around the pumpkin pie, you could ask, “Grandpa, do you think it’s possible to reconcile our urge to punish with our limited resources and our constitutional duty to rehabilitate?”  
To get you started, here’s a rundown of criminal justice topics likely to grab attention at the General Assembly in 2026.
New crimes, enhanced penalties
Like Clark Griswold’s jelly-of-the-month membership, this is the gift that keeps on giving. Every year, new crimes and enhanced penalties are proposed. In the last three sessions alone, more than 30 changes to the Indiana Code have expanded the reach of the criminal justice system. Just as surely as the Hoosiers will keep the Oaken Bucket, there will be proposals to add more pages to the law books.
This overcriminalization is untenable. Changing times may require changes in the law. But steady expansion of the criminal code is, as Justices Kagan, Scalia, and Thomas put it, a “pathology.” With a 36% recidivism rate, incarceration isn’t particularly rehabilitative. And with roughly 3,000 ways to commit a crime, we’ve set plenty of traps and given the prosecution tremendous leverage. It all leads to more pressure to plead guilty and longer sentences.
And it’s unsustainable. Prison populations are growing, and capacity is hovering around 95%. Even when the new billion-dollar facility opens, the DOC plans to keep the 19th-century Indiana State Prison open indefinitely. New crimes and enhanced penalties are partially to blame.  
Preventive Detention
Pretrial release legislation is also a lock in 2026. From the White House to the local courthouse, some think we are presuming too much innocence.  
We will see the return of a proposed constitutional amendment to eliminate the right to bail for those who pose a “substantial risk.”  The term is loosely defined, with few guidelines and no due-process protections for those labeled too risky to enjoy their liberty.    
Fortunately, a broad coalition agrees that due process is not optional. So, alongside the amendment, we should see implementing legislation. If done correctly, this trailer bill could significantly improve the system.  
In a world with preventive detention and risk-based assessments, we can promote both safety and fairness without relying on an antiquated bail system. The dangerous can be detained, and the harmless can be released on their own recognizance. In between are conditions like house arrest, electronic monitoring, and frequent reporting, none of which speak to wealth or poverty.    
If this sounds like “bail reform” or “cashless bail” and makes you uncomfortable, try calling it “less cash bail.” Either way, preventive detention and reform are not mutually exclusive.                      
The Death Penalty
We are at a genuine crossroads with respect to capital punishment. A bipartisan group of legislators wants to abolish it. Some want to enlist firing squads. Others are somewhere in the middle. Legislation from these camps will likely surface in 2026.  
The death penalty is fundamentally flawed. It is impossible to apply uniformly across the state. Counties can’t afford it, and trading the executioner’s expensive syringe for a cheap bullet won’t solve the problem. It adds to the moral quandary and won’t meaningfully reduce costs. Most tax dollars are rightly spent on ensuring the trial is fair and the penalty appropriate.
Then there is the unacceptably high error rate. Beyond wrongful convictions, it is unclear whether we consistently apply medically informed standards when assessing the intellectual functioning of capital defendants.  
Suffice it to say, the conversation should continue — ideally without callous sloganeering.         
Mental Health
Of all the topics here, this might be the most suitable for your holiday gatherings. As Scrooge’s nephew put it, this is the time of year to think of people “as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.”  
Yet our jails and prisons remain the mental-health providers of last resort. State hospitals are filled with defendants receiving competency-restoration services, many of whom are charged with minor misdemeanors. And law enforcement officers are still being thrust into situations even trained medical professionals would fear to tread.        
The General Assembly has taken this seriously in recent years. Mental health advocates and providers will come calling again.  Hopefully, we can find the political will to invest in treatment and housing, rather than punishment and detention.    
I hope you get your shopping done early, soak up the sights and sounds of the season, and enjoy your time with your family and friends. At least you can’t deny that you’re prepared for the annual political dustup. It’s up to you to get ready for the feats of strength.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/prisoner-behind-bars-handcuffs-jail-prison-getty-e1673729426865-1.jpg,,,2025-11-24 07:58:23.423919

(Photo courtesy Freije & Freije Auctioneers)A year after his prison sentence, former Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel’s belongings have sold for millions toward the $3.1 million in criminal restitution he owes.
The funds — now sitting in court-controlled escrow accounts — have come from sweeping liquidations of Noel’s properties, classic cars, firearms and various luxury items.
But civil judgements against Noel are rolling in, too. In October, he was ordered to pay back more than $900,000 — plus interest — to reimburse the county jail’s commissary fund. Another $122,000 was awarded earlier this month to resolve Noel’s mismanagement of his brothers estate. Numerous other civil cases are still pending and could result in other restitution mandates.
Noel pleaded guilty in 2024 to 27 felony charges — including corrupt business influence, theft, tax evasion and official misconduct — and was ordered to repay millions to New Chapel EMS, Indiana tax officials and state and local law enforcement agencies.

He’s currently serving his 15-year sentence at the New Castle Correctional Annex. Three of those years will be suspended to probation, and he could be released earlier with good behavior and programming credits.
Findings from a lengthy Indiana State Police investigation found that Noel used millions of taxpayer dollars from the Utica Volunteer Firefighters Association and New Chapel EMS to buy cars, planes, vacations, clothing and other personal luxury purchases. Investigators said public funds were also used to pay for college tuition and child support.
The disgraced former sheriff was additionally accused of tasking county employees with jobs related to his personal collection of classic cars. At least 40 vehicles were confiscated by law enforcement, including a bevy of classics, such as two 1970 Plymouth Superbirds, a 1959 Corvette and 1966 and 1968 Chargers, according to search warrant returns.
More than $2.7 million has been raised so far through a series of auctions and forced property sales overseen by the Clark and Washington county courts, with most of the proceeds held until a special judge determines how to divide the funds among criminal-restitution recipients and claimants in ongoing civil litigation.
Not all of that money is available for restitution due to outstanding mortgages, auction fees and other obligations.
Escrow accounts now exceed $1.2 million
Two escrow accounts maintained in Washington County hold the bulk of restitution dollars. As of Nov. 20, balances reached $1,171,415.10 in one account and $74,380.97 in another. Those accounts contain auction proceeds and other property-sale revenue tied to Noel’s criminal case.
Clark County also holds escrow funds from multiple pre-judgment property sales — including two Jeffersonville-area homes sold earlier this year.
Any funds deposited after liens, mortgages, taxes and fees will eventually be distributed once the Indiana Attorney General’s civil lawsuit — alleging years of financial misconduct surrounding New Chapel EMS, a nonprofit ambulance service that contracted with Clark and Floyd counties — is resolved.
Court records show judges have so far only authorized limited withdrawals from escrow to cover essential expenses on Noel’s remaining unsold property, the home at 3001 Old Tay Bridge Road in Jeffersonville. In July, Special Judge Roger Duvall approved the release of $2,000 to Lopp Realtors to maintain the property. In November, the judge approved another $1,000 for the same purpose.

Nearly all of Noel’s Indiana real estate has already been liquidated. 
A Utica-area property sold for $800,000 in January. Included in the sale were adjacent properties on Old Salem Road in Jeffersonville — a pole barn used to store dozens of vehicles and a log-cabin-style home where family members lived.
In March, Noel’s 7,982-square-foot Jeffersonville mansion sold for $635,000, less than the $699,000 the Noels paid in 2022.
Still unresolved, however, is the Old Tay Bridge Road home, which is the subject of a foreclosure case filed in October by MSR Asset Vehicle LLC. The property carries tax debt and a significant mortgage — more than $261,000 still owed, according to court documents.
Separately, Noel’s Naples, Florida, residence is under contract for roughly $570,000, though that property also has an outstanding mortgage. Once it closes, its net proceeds are expected to be added to the escrow holdings.
Car auctions generated more than $1.27 million
But the biggest single boost to Noel’s restitution came from the sale of 43 classic cars, which brought in $1,277,950 during a two-day auction in May. The auction took place in French Lick as part of Freije & Freije Auctioneers’ annual “Big Boy Toy Auction,” but the proceeds were supervised by Washington County’s special-judge appointed in the Noel case.
Among the highest-value sales were a 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon that sold for $160,000, two 1970 Plymouth Roadrunner Superbirds that fetched $162,500 and $175,000, and a 1969 Plymouth Roadrunner that brought $100,000.
Court documents describe how Noel used $52,504 from his brother’s estate to buy the Roadrunner, then reimbursed the estate by withdrawing nearly the same amount from New Chapel EMS the following month.

Vehicles seized from Noel’s pole barn — including a 1959 Chevy Corvette, a 1968 Dodge Charger and several restored muscle cars — rounded out the nearly $1.3 million total.
Earlier, in January, Freije & Freije auctioned off more than 150 of Noel’s firearms, dozens of custom suits and several Rolex watches. 
Many of the suits — some lined with sheriff’s emblems or embroidered with Noel’s name — sold for around $200 despite initial prices in the thousands. Auction officials said all items moved in less than two hours.
A later online auction in March brought in $72,425. More than 100 people previewed the items in person, and 404 bidders competed for nearly 300 lots, which included a heavy-duty tool chest that sold for $3,250, as well as sheriff’s plaques, furniture and personal items from Noel’s pole barn.
Court approves separate payouts
The escrow accounts are also being tapped to resolve civil cases lodged by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, which seek to force Noel to pay back the state agencies he allegedly took public funds from to pay for personal spending.
In one lawsuit, Rokita argued that Noel should be required to reimburse the Clark County jail commissary fund more than $900,000 for “funds misappropriated, diverted, or misapplied,” which were cited in an audit report filed by the State Board of Accounts last year.
Duvall ordered last month that Noel must pay a sum of $918,000 as punitive damages, in addition to $122,500 in interest. The judge’s order noted that additional annual statutory interest of 8% will be applied until the judgment is fully satisfied, meaning the total balance owed could top nearly $1.5 million by the time Noel is expected to be released from prison in June 2033.
The amount is in addition to the more than $3 million Noel agreed to pay as part of his criminal case.
In wake of Jamey Noel investigation, lawmakers advance bill to increase oversight over jail funds

The judge also ordered payout in a separate civil matter filed by Noel’s three nieces and nephew, who alleged that he mishandled their father’s estate funds after being appointed executor.
On Nov. 6, Duvall approved a $122,000 mediated settlement — including damages and attorney fees — and authorized the money to be released from escrow. 
In the ruling, Duvall wrote that the children “join a long list of persons and entities that have been damaged by the unlawful acts of Jamey Noel and family members.” 
He emphasized that the money originated from the sale of estate property and that paying the children did not come at the expense of victims connected to the New Chapel EMS scheme.
Noel agreed to a plea deal nearly a year after he was arrested and state police investigators raided his home in southern Indiana.
His agreement requires him to pay back $2,870,924 in public funds to the Utica Volunteer Firefighters Association, which did business as New Chapel EMS; $61,190 to the Clark County Sheriff’s Department; $173,155 to the Indiana Department of Revenue; and $35,245 to the Indiana State Police.
Court documents further point to at least $33,000 worth of public funds used by Noel to make contributions to various Republican candidates and campaigns between 2020 and 2023. Some of the candidates and campaignshave since been returned or donated those dollars elsewhere.
It’s up to the court to decide how restitution payments should be prioritized and how to reconcile claims across Noel’s multiple criminal and civil dockets. 
Until then, court officials said all remaining escrowed funds will remain frozen except for court-approved costs and payouts.

And for more than a decade, the agency has vowed to tackle these problems by overhauling the computer systems that help determine whether people qualify for social safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low-income people.
But needed technology changes are once again on hold, thanks to a barrage of deadlines mandated by Congress this summer as part of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” —  most notably work requirements and more frequent renewals for Medicaid.
Instead of moving forward with a long-promised modernization of its eligibility software, the Missouri Department of Social Services must focus its time and staff toward meeting sweeping federal deadlines in Trump’s new law. And that means the integrated SNAP-Medicaid system won’t arrive anytime soon.
Plans to combine eligibility software for SNAP and Medicaid into a single, updated system will have to wait until at least 2028, said Toi Wilde, chief information officer for the Missouri Department of Social Services.
“You don’t want this type of huge, major policy shift that you have going,” Wilde said. “Going into a full implementation of a new system would be extremely challenging [during this shift].”
News of the delay inspired dismay among those who have been battling with the department for years to ensure eligible Missourians get access to benefits they are entitled to receive. What’s worse, advocates say, is that delays come as the department is trying to appeal the 2024 federal court decision that found its administration of the SNAP program illegally denied food benefits to Missourians.
Katherine Holley, an attorney for Legal Services of Eastern Missouri who defended plaintiffs in that lawsuit, said her organization’s clients are still struggling to get department staff on the phone to complete required eligibility interviews.
Clients call the department trying to complete their interview, she said, only to hear that there are hundreds of people in front of them in the queue. One client was recently terminated from SNAP, she said, when a document he submitted to the department online got lost.
“I reached out to the agency, and then they found it, and they opened his benefits back up,” Holley said. “But if he hadn’t reached out to us, he would just be without benefits.”
 System struggles

The Missouri Department of Social Services resource center located in Columbia, on April 18, 2023 (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).
The department’s attempt to combine its systems in 2013 ended earlier this year after a decade-long legal battle that cost the state $92.7 million, including interest.
The department contracted with the software company EngagePoint in June 2013 to build a system to meet requirements in the Affordable Care Act and handle eligibility and enrollment for SNAP and Medicaid.
Missouri didn’t expand Medicaid until 2021, but the 2010 federal law required states to make other changes. States had to start using a new method to measure income to determine Medicaid eligibility for most adults, and they had to update their eligibility and enrollment systems to exchange information with the federal marketplace.
The department had big ambitions for its tech upgrades: “a comprehensive, fully integrated, state-of-the-art automated human services eligibility, enrollment and case management system,” according to its January 2013 request for proposals.
But the state terminated the contract three years early, with the new system partially built. Missourians’ SNAP cases stayed in the old system, alongside Medicaid for elderly or disabled Missourians. Only the Medicaid cases subject to new federal income measurement were migrated to the newer system.
Advocates and experts say separate systems can cause problems.
Integrated systems allow people to take fewer steps to apply for and maintain SNAP and Medicaid benefits, which reduces the chance that they’ll be wrongly denied benefits. Well-integrated systems are also better at handling the complexity of overlapping but distinct federal eligibility rules for SNAP and Medicaid so state employees bear less of that burden.
Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said integrated systems make it easier for states to offer combined applications for Medicaid and SNAP and for information to carry over across programs when people complete annual renewals or submit changes.
Combined systems streamline state employees’ work, and the savings gets passed down to people accessing the programs.
“From a caseworker perspective, because so much of the eligibility determination keys off each other and uses the same information, you can touch a case much less often,” Wagner said. 
Holley said a lack of coordination between Missouri’s SNAP and Medicaid systems has caused clients to lose benefits, partly because annual renewals for Medicaid and SNAP happen on different timelines. 
A past client updated their address while renewing their Medicaid coverage, Holley said. The address didn’t transfer to the other system, so that when it was time for the client to recertify their SNAP eligibility, the paperwork was sent to their old address. The client lost their benefits.
“Those systems don’t talk,” Holley said.
 Barriers to access

Attorneys for the plaintiffs in the federal SNAP lawsuit said continuing challenges completing annual renewals are part of the reason it’s so important for the court not to let the department off the hook. 
While the department argued in its request for an appeal that it had already addressed the harms to the individual plaintiffs in the case by granting them interviews and benefits, the attorneys said plaintiffs are likely to encounter the same denials for failure to interview.
“All of these people want to keep their benefits and are trying their hardest,” Holley said.
One of the plaintiffs, Mary Holmes, lost SNAP benefits during the lawsuit because the department said she incorrectly filled out recertification paperwork, Holley said.
Data the department is court-ordered to submit to the court each month suggest improvements in the number of times people get disconnected when the call center is overloaded. It also shows fewer SNAP applications are being rejected only due to failure to complete an interview.

But Katie Deabler, an attorney from the National Center for Law and Economic Justice who is also representing plaintiffs in the case, said the department hasn’t been submitting data long enough to demonstrate improvements will last.
Deabler, who has worked on SNAP cases in multiple states, said application volumes often vary with the seasons. Applications tend to pick up in the summer and over the winter holidays, when kids can’t receive food in school.
Though the average time someone spends on hold waiting for an interview has decreased from 57 minutes in February to 23 minutes in October, average wait times were slightly up in July, August, September and October from a year ago. That’s in four of the six months where there are two years of data. 

The department has fallen short of a benchmark U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Harpool set in May of 90% of all callers spending no more than 20 minutes on hold. In October, that was true of 62% of people waiting for a SNAP interview. The longest anyone spent on hold that month, the department reported, was 2 hours and 22 minutes, down from a peak of 6 hours and 3 minutes in March.
“Agencies that are trying to fix these sorts of big, systemic problems,” Deabler said, “they really can’t just sit back and take a break just because there’s a few months that looked okay.”
 “A perfect storm in a terrible way”

Wagner, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the “Big Beautiful Bill” has created “a perfect storm in a terrible way.”
The law requires states next year to begin implementing sweeping policy changes to Medicaid with sharply reduced administrative funding for SNAP and under intense pressure to minimize errors in SNAP payments.
“That means less resources and a ton more work and a lot more severe consequences if the work is not done perfectly,” Wagner said.
Beginning in October 2027, states with SNAP error rates of 6% or higher will have to pay 5 to 15% of the cost of the food benefits they issue. States’ current performance will be used to determine if and how much they must pay.
“So states have not a short timeframe, but a negative timeframe, to affect the error rate that will determine whether the state can maintain the program or not,” Wagner said.
Missouri’s error rate was 9.42% in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Wilde, the state social services department’s chief information officer, said that while the department focuses on implementing the federal law, it’s making changes to streamline staffers’ workflow while planning for the eventual replacement of its systems.
The department has developed a process to automatically transfer some information from SNAP applications into the eligibility system, Wilde said, without requiring “a bunch of manual touches” from staffers, saving about 400 hours of work so far.
“What we’ve been doing,” she said, “is reimagining, in the intermediacy, til different systems…are put in place, what are some low tech solutions that still have big, really good [impacts] and that can help the process?”
Wilde said the department has also upgraded its automated call center technology so Missourians can get more information about their SNAP and Medicaid cases without having to wait on hold. 
The department has also started work to allow its call center technology to feed more information to its eligibility systems, Wilde said, in anticipation of more frequent Medicaid recertifications next year.
For Missourians struggling to access needed assistance, the stakes are high. 
Deabler said that regardless of pressures from the federal government, the state has a legal responsibility to provide SNAP benefits to people who are eligible.
“States owe the same duty to the people who rely on this program to feed their families that they always did,” Deabler said.
Holley said she and others at Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, “keep see[ing] people cycling back through, needing our help again and again.”
“In theory, all of these systems should work to keep people who qualify for benefits…in receipt of them,” Holley said. “They should continue to receive benefits. They’re doing what they need to do. It’s frustrating.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041623_swillum1-scaled-e1717605040418-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-24 06:57:03.498080

Aug. 1, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)FREMONT, Neb. — Former State Sen. Lynne Walz on Monday launched an exploratory committee to run for Nebraska governor in 2026, seeking to uplift Nebraskans’ concerns instead of their partisanship.
Walz, in an announcement interview with the Nebraska Examiner, said the state’s political system and economy are “broken.” She said she wants to hear from Nebraskans about their lives and work to find solutions together before formally launching a formal gubernatorial bid. Such arrangements let potential candidates raise money and gauge public support.
“This campaign is going to be a campaign for the people, and it’s my job, as far as I’m concerned, to go out and really listen to the people,” Walz said.
Walz said politicians, no matter their political stripes, are “no longer interested in fighting for the average person,” so she said it’s important to elect “average people” who know the real world. She’s a former fourth and fifth grade teacher, local church leader and mother of three who has worked various jobs to make ends meet, from sorting seed corn to working in a local deli.

Walz plans to travel the state in early December and hold listening sessions with taxpayers. She said she would incorporate those ideas into her campaign for governor, a decision she expects to finalize in early 2026. Non-incumbents must file by March 2.
“If we’re finding that we’re on the same page, that people, like me, are having the same struggles that I am with health care costs, with housing costs, transportation, day care cost, then I’m all in on running for governor,” Walz said.
Walz in 2018 ran as the Democratic lieutenant governor candidate for then-State Sen. Bob Krist, who sought to unseat then-Gov. Pete Ricketts. 
Ricketts received 59% support. Should she run, she would be seeking to be the state’s first Democratic governor since former Gov. Ben Nelson was term-limited in 1999. 
Campaign priorities
Walz served two terms as a Democratic state senator in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature, a legislative moderate representing Republican-leaning Dodge County and Valley.
The former teacher served all eight years on the Education Committee, which she chaired in 2021 and 2022 with the support of Republicans and Democrats. 
She lost reelection as chair in 2023 and 2024, when the body shifted in a more conservative direction.
This January, a term-limited Walz returned to being a realtor in Fremont full time.
Among Walz’s early list of priorities is affordability of health care, child care and housing; an eye toward education and a “laser focus” on economic development.
Walz said she would announce a property tax plan “soon” but that all Nebraskans need to work together. She said there have been opportunities to do so, such as a 2022 plan she worked on with then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, a Republican running for Congress in the Omaha area.

Those plans were built on statewide feedback, but she said the then-Ricketts-led executive branch ran “interference,” in part, she argued, because of her political party.
“That’s a sad situation for 1.9 million people in Nebraska,” Walz said. “That’s not the way things should work.”
In 2024, Walz joined a small, bipartisan group of lawmakers developing a long-term school funding and property tax relief plan that phased in over a decade rather than moving as quickly as Gov. Jim Pillen’s competing proposal.
Walz said that those who know her know that party labels don’t matter to her, but the current system “forces” people to choose a letter behind their name. To her, she said, “Democrat” represents the values of her father: faith, hard work and family love. He provided for those around him, she said.
As governor, Walz said she would not care who brought property tax relief proposals so long as they’re responsible, intentional and don’t hurt people. She said property tax relief requires economic development through new and expanded businesses. 
Walz helped pass a bill in 2022 to more quickly build and improve the state’s expressway system at less cost. She said she plans to bring the business community together for a long-term strategic plan.
“Let’s just bring something, and let’s get it done,” Walz said.
 A swing vote
When she came to the Legislature in 2017, having unseated a Republican incumbent in a red district, she said she had to listen to all sides. Walz said she “absolutely” considers herself a moderate. 
“They don’t come in with preconceived ideas, and they don’t come in with somebody telling them how they have to vote and having to bow down to that,” Walz said. “A moderate can think for themselves, and that’s exactly what I do.”

In her first year, Walz passed a bill to prohibit cities and counties from canceling health insurance coverage for first responders injured while on duty for at least one year after the injury, giving families time to plan ahead. It earned Walz an award as legislator of the year from the Fraternal Order of Police.
In 2020, Walz was one of just four registered Democrats at the time to pass a bill banning a second-trimester abortion method known medically as dilation and evacuation. In 2023, she was eyed as a swing vote on a bill seeking to ban abortions after six weeks post-fertilization. The bill ultimately passed to ban most abortions after 12 weeks gestational age after one Republican balked at the stricter language.
Walz had tried to find middle ground when the abortion fight was attached to another contentious social issue that year: gender care for youths with gender dysphoria. She introduced a compromise amendment she had crafted with Republican input, focused on an abortion exception for fatal fetal anomalies and specifying gender care regulations. Her changes weren’t considered, and she voted against the final bill.
Education, affordability and economics
On education, Walz said it’s important for high schools to offer more students individualized opportunities to succeed, such as career and technical education, for which she said Fremont has been a model. She also wants the state to provide more resources to students at a “very early age.” 
The former teacher said she remembers young students who came to school abused or hungry. Many struggled to learn.
Walz in 2024 appropriated $10 million for school security infrastructure improvement grants in the wake of school shootings nationally.
On affordability, Walz said the state must focus on structural costs it can control, such as via housing grants or expanded down payment assistance for young families. She is also interested in child care provider incentives.
State Sen. Lynne Walz of Fremont. March 23, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
While there is a “moral obligation” to help those in need, Walz said the government can’t solve everyone’s problems, and she said it should work with businesses and workers to create opportunities so Nebraskans can improve their own lives.
Walz said she would work with the federal government and uphold the “will of the people” as indicated in recent ballot measures.
The 2024 statewide vote on school choice and state-funded school vouchers for private schools also solidified Walz’s opposition to the state subsidizing private school costs of attendance. She was “present, not voting” — which she described as a “soft no” — on the passage of a tax-credit based model in 2023 and a replacement direct scholarship model in 2024.
Walz said she and her husband, Chris, worked five to six jobs to put their three children through private school, because the couple wanted the faith-based education. However, Walz said they didn’t ask anyone to pay for them. She said she worries state funding could lead to more state involvement in private education and jeopardize the faith-based focus the Walz family wanted.
She said she doesn’t want to take away money that could go to public education and said vouchers often go to wealthy families already sending kids to private school.
Family and job experience
Walz grew up on a small hog farm north of Fremont in Fontanelle, Nebraska. She and her brother ran the farm while her father, a construction worker and union member, worked. Walz said it was “one of the best experiences,” that it taught her hard work, loving God’s creation and the importance of family.
After high school, while friends were packing bags to go to college, Walz said she moved in with and advocated for three ladies living with developmental disabilities. On bad days, the women gave Walz the hugs and support she needed.
“It taught me how to advocate for people,” Walz said. “It taught me that everybody has a gift.”
After meeting her husband, Walz said the couple had two boys and she went to college for teaching. She opened a day care to keep her kids at home. She later worked various jobs to make ends meet, from 3M in the evening to sorting corn seed as well as the Hinky Dinky deli.
She went back to helping families with developmental disabilities before becoming a fourth and fifth grade teacher at Northside Elementary School in Fremont. After having a third child, a girl, she earned a real estate license. 
‘Love your neighbor’
Walz said her faith remains the “center” of all of her decisions. She holds a leadership role in the Nebraska Synod Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and has been a Bible school teacher and Sunday school teacher.
State Sen. Lynne Walz of Fremont. July 22, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
She said her parents and grandparents taught her to love God and her neighbor. She said her parents helped people, including with food and basic needs, and took in her grandparents when her grandpa had cancer.
“When Jesus said ‘love your neighbor,’ there was a period at the end of that sentence,” Walz said.
She says love is unconditional whether Nebraskans look the same, have the same faith or share political views. 
“I’ll do everything I can to make sure that we are united and we all have common goals, because there are really more things that unite us than things that divide us,” Walz said.
‘Going to work furiously’
Should Walz decide to run for governor, she said she would run in the Democratic primary, set for May 12. She is only known Democrat considering a bid.  The Democratic primary winner would advance to the Nov. 3 general election, along with the GOP winner.
Pillen has announced his reelection campaign. Also running is Jacy Todd of York, a combat medic veteran, small business owner and notary for recent medical cannabis petitions. Charles Herbster, an agribusinessman 2022 Pillen opponent, is flirting with a 2026 rematch.
Walz said her focus is common good and positive impact with ideas rooted in listening to Nebraskans, not partisan fights.
“We’re not going to be pointing fingers,” Walz said. “We’re going to move ahead, and we’re going to work furiously and focus on what needs to be done to better the lives of the people who live here.”

An audit of the department's use of data from the Flock surveillance camera system shows inconsistent reporting the reasons on the reasons investigators access the information, a problem common among police agencies. (Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Like other Wisconsin law enforcement agencies, the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department (WCSD) uses Flock cameras for many reasons, though department personnel don’t always clearly document what those reasons are. Audit data reveals that staff most frequently entered “investigation” in order to access Flock’s network, while other documented uses are raising concerns among privacy advocates. 
Flock cameras perpetually photograph and, using AI-powered license plate reader technology, identify vehicles traversing roadways. Flock’s system can be used to view a vehicle’s journey, even weeks after capturing an image, or flag specific vehicles for law enforcement which have been placed on “Be On The Lookout” (BOLO) lists.
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
As of March 2025, the company Flock Safety was valued at $7.5 billion, with over 5,000 law enforcement agencies using its cameras nationwide. At least  221 of those agencies are in Wisconsin, including the city of Waukesha’s police department as well as  the county sheriff . The Wisconsin Examiner obtained Flock audit data from the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department through open records requests, covering Flock searches from January 2024 to July 2025, and used computer programming to analyze the data.
Over that period of time, more than 6,700 Flock searches were conducted by WCSD using only “investigation”, as well as abbreviations or misspellings of the word. The searches, as they appeared in the audit data, offered no other context to suggest why specifically Flock’s network had been searched. Lt. Nicholas Wenzel, a sheriff’s department spokesperson, wrote in an email statement that “investigation” has a broad usage when Flock is involved. 
“A deputy/detective using Flock for an investigation is using it for a wide range of public safety situations,” Wenzel explained. “Flock assists in locating missing persons during Amber or Silver Alert by identifying their vehicles and has proven effective in recovering stolen cars. Investigators use Flock to track suspect vehicles in serious crimes such as homicides, assaults, robberies, and shootings, as well as in property crimes like burglaries, catalytic converter thefts, and package thefts. The system also supports traffic-related investigations, including hit-and-run cases, and enables agencies to share information across jurisdictions to track offenders who travel between communities.”
Widespread use of vague search terms 
Dave Maass, director of investigations at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that terms like “investigation” are too vague to determine whether or not Flock was used appropriately.  At least some responsibility falls on Flock Safety itself, Maass argues. “They’re setting up a system where it’s impossible for somebody to audit it,” he told the Wisconsin Examiner. “And I think that’s the big problem, is that there’s no baseline requirement that you have to have a case related to this…They say you have to have a law enforcement purpose. But if you just put the word ‘investigation’ there, how do you know? Like, how do you know that this is not somebody stalking their ex-partner? How do you know whether this is somebody looking up information about celebrities? How do you know whether it’s racist or not? And you just don’t, because nobody is checking any of these things.”
The audit also stored other vague search terms used by WCSD such as “f”, “cooch”, “freddy”, “ts”, “nathan”, and “hunt” which Lt. Wenzel would not define.“The search terms are associated with investigations, some of which remain active,” he wrote in an email statement. “To preserve the integrity of these ongoing investigations, no further description or clarification of the terms can be provided at this time.”

In August, Wisconsin Examiner published a similar Flock analysis that also found agencies statewide entering only the word “investigation,” with no other descriptor, in order to access Flock. At nearly 20,000 searches (not including misspellings and abbreviations), the term “investigation” was in fact the most often used term in that analysis, which relied on audit data obtained from the Wauwatosa Police Department. 
While data from the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department appeared in that first Flock story, that analysis focused on broad trends which appeared among at least 221 unique agencies using Flock in Wisconsin. This more recent analysis focuses specifically on the Waukesha County Sheriff Department’s use of the camera network. 
The August report found that the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department appeared among the top 10 Wisconsin law enforcement agencies that used Flock the most. The report also found that some agencies also only entered “.” — a period — in the Flock system field to indicate the reason for using the system. The West Allis Police Department led Wisconsin in this particular search term, followed by the Waukesha Police Department and the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office. 
In response to an inquiry from the Wisconsin Examiner, a Waukesha Police Department spokesperson  said that an officer who’d conducted nearly 400 Flock searches using only “.” as the reason had been provided extra training, and that the officer’s behavior had been corrected after the Wisconsin Examiner reached out. The West Allis Police Department,  on the other hand, did not suggest that its officers were using the Flock network improperly. 
Use of vague search terms is chronic across Flock’s network, Maass has found. He recalled  one nationwide audit that covered 11.4 million Flock searches over a six-month period. Of those some 22,743 “just dots” appeared as reasons for Flock searches. Searches using only the word “investigation” made up about 14.5% of all searches, he said. 
“So yeah, that’s a problem,” Maass told the Wisconsin Examiner. Reviewing a copy of Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department audit data, Maass saw the same vague search terms that have been reported by the Examiner. Although some terms can be reasonably guessed — such as “repo” perhaps meaning repossession, or ICAC, which usually stands for Internet Crimes Against Children — others aren’t so easy.

“‘Hunt’ can mean anything,” said Maass, referring to a term which appeared 24 times within the Waukesha Sheriff’s data. Maass points to the search term “f”, which the Wisconsin Examiner’s analysis found WCSD used to search Flock 806 times. 
Maass highlights that each search touches hundreds or even thousands of individual Flock networks nationwide. “If I’m one of these agencies that gets hit by this system, how am I to know if this is a legitimate search or not?” Maass said. “Now, maybe somebody at Waukesha is going through their own system, and like questioning every officer about every case. Maybe they’re doing that. Probably not.” 
Wenzel of the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department said that although some searches appear vague,  deputies and detectives are required by department policy to document their use of Flock in reports. Although a case number category does appear in the audit data, this column was rendered blank, making it impossible for Wisconsin Examiner to determine how often Flock searches had case numbers, or whether those case numbers corresponded with specific investigations the sheriff’s department had on file. 
“The Sheriff’s Office understands the concerns surrounding emerging technology and takes very seriously its responsibility to protect the privacy and civil rights of the community,” Wenzel said in a statement. “The use of Flock license plate recognition technology is guided by clear safeguards to ensure it is only used for legitimate law enforcement purposes.” 
The department’s policy, Wenzel explained, “prohibits any use outside of legitimate criminal investigations.” He said that deputies undergo initial and ongoing training to use the camera network. “All system activity is logged and subject to review,” said Wenzel.
Maass says the department can’t back-check the searches conducted by other agencies using the Waukesha Flock network, however. “Because when we’re talking about millions of searches coming through their system, you know, every few months…like hundreds of thousands at least every month…how are they actually quality controlling any of these?” Maass told the Wisconsin Examiner. “They’re just not.”

Wenzel said that “the technology is not used for general surveillance, traffic enforcement, or monitoring individuals not connected to an investigation.” The Wisconsin Examiner’s analysis, however, detected 43 searches logged as “surveillance” and 30 searches logged as “traffic offense.” The audit data also contained at least 357 searches logged as “suspicious” or variations of the word, as well as another 14 logged as “suspicious driving behavior,” 52 searches for “road rage” and 36 logged as “identify driver”.
There were also 62 searches related to evictions, which privacy advocates contend  go beyond the public safety roles that the cameras were originally pitched to serve.
“Evictions can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous situations,” said Wenzel. “The removal of individuals from a residence often creates heightened emotions, uncertainty, and sometimes resistance. For this reason, safety is the top priority for both the residents being evicted and the deputies carrying out the court order. Flock is utilized to determine if the former tenants have left the area or could possibly be in the area when the court order is being carried out.” 
Jon McCray Jones, policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin, said in a statement that the Waukesha Sheriff’s use of Flock has extended “far beyond the public safety justifications for which these tools were originally sold.” McCray Jones told the Wisconsin Examiner, “These systems were introduced to the public as a means to reduce violent crime and aid in solving serious investigations. However, when they are used for non-criminal purposes, such as evictions, they cross a dangerous line.”  
Waukesha’s uses for evictions were particularly concerning for McCray Jones. “What’s happening here is surveillance technology, operated by taxpayer-funded public servants, being weaponized at the behest of private landlords and corporations,” he said. “That is exactly the kind of mission creep communities are most worried about when it comes to police surveillance. If Flock cameras can be repurposed to target tenants today, what stops law enforcement tomorrow from using facial recognition to track people who fall behind on rent, or phone location data to monitor whether workers are ‘really sick’ when they call off? We’ve seen documented cases where law enforcement misused surveillance systems to track down romantic interests. Once the floodgate is opened, the slide into abuse is fast and quiet.” 
Wenzel said that access to the Flock network is limited to personnel who are properly trained and authorized to use the software, and the department’s policy is regularly reviewed by those personnel. 
“Searches are limited to legitimate law enforcement purposes per department policy,” he wrote in an email statement. The department has conducted its own Flock audits, Wenzel explained, and no sheriff department staff have ever been disciplined or re-trained due to Flock-related issues. Although the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department is part of the federal 287(g) program, in which local law enforcement agencies participate in federal immigration enforcement, Wenzel said that Flock is not used as part of the program, and the Wisconsin Examiner didn’t find any clear examples of immigration-related uses by the sheriff’s department. 
McCray Jones considers the Waukesha Sheriff’s use of Flock to be an example of why “surveillance technology in the hands of law enforcement must be tightly limited, narrowly defined, and rigorously transparent.” He stressed that every use “must be clearly logged and justified — not with vague categories like ‘investigation’ or ‘repo’, but with meaningful explanations the public can actually understand and evaluate. Without strict guardrails, audits like this reveal how quickly tools justified in the name of ‘safety’ turn into instruments of convenience or even private gain.” 
With the growth of surveillance technologies and the civil liberties implications they raise, McCray Jones said that the public “deserves clear proof that it is being used only to reduce crime — particularly violent crime — and not to serve the interests of landlords or corporations. Accountability and transparency aren’t optional add-ons; they are the bare minimum to prevent abuse.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Amid a bizarre crusade to eviscerate the line between church and state and a seeming zeal to rapidly expand school choice to all, the number of charter schools seems to be approaching a saturation point.
And it’s become a real headscratcher that our lawmakers aren’t willing to do the heavy lifting to better regulate this critical part of our academic infrastructure. Maybe that could include requiring these schools to meet certain academic performance thresholds to remain open or penalizing sponsors who aren’t providing adequate oversight. It could also include capping how many of these institutions can exist at once, setting enrollment minimums in order to operate, ensuring teacher qualifications and setting maximum student-to-teacher ratios.
Right now, state law inexplicably exempts these types of schools from most statutes relating to traditional school districts, including that they employ educators with valid teaching certificates.
At the very least, it certainly feels like we no longer need to provide any more of these schools with as much as $50,000 in start-up funding because we’ve stimulated the industry enough.
Reports show we have 26 brick-and-mortar charter schools and seven virtual ones.
At least one of these schools, which last week was placed on probation, is being allowed to operate at a ratio of 115 students to 1 teacher and had a financial deficit of over $274,000. Supporters say they don’t have enough students to pay the bills and had to lay off teachers.
There’s no way a student can learn with a ratio like that. 
The state’s largest virtual charter school, Epic, is under investigation after mismanagement led to mass layoffs and program cuts. In all, about 500 employees were laid off after administrators reportedly underestimated expenses while overestimating revenue. That has jeopardized the solvency of the school that serves over 20,000 students. That school had to take out a $30 million line of credit.
As the Statewide Charter School Board struggles to regulate what currently exists, eight more brick-and-mortar locations want permission to open, including one that was already rejected by Moore Public Schools and another that was rebuffed by Tulsa’s Union Public Schools. State law gives rejected schools the option to override local control by then applying at the state level. 
Meanwhile, a Florida-based Jewish organization wants to open a school here that would  become the nation’s first publicly funded religious charter school. That’s despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in May that blocked another religious charter school from opening. Our nation’s highest court upheld a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that found the Statewide Charter School Board acted unconstitutionally when it tried to create a publicly funded Catholic school.
Still the National Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School Foundation has notified the board that it wants to use our tax dollars to operate the Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School. The group’s representative founded six non-religious English-Hebrew charter schools in Florida. Its school in Oklahoma would serve just 40 students.
Brian Shellem, the chair of the Oklahoma’s charter oversight board, isn’t dismissing the idea of another religious charter school. He says that he won’t “prejudge” the application.
Because the high court deadlocked 4-4, with one justice recusing, supporters of publicly funded religious charter schools believe this issue could easily head back to the U.S. Supreme Court and result in a different outcome. Following May’s deadlock, Gov. Kevin Stitt said the matter is “far from a settled issue” and that Oklahoma is in “overtime” and there would be another case.  Stitt appointed Shellem to the charter school oversight board, which pledged to respect the decision that barred St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School from operating.
Oklahoma doesn’t need to be the one that leads the religious charter school fight, and we don’t need to be the test dummy for every right-wing scheme that comes our way. We certainly don’t need to be the ones wasting even more precious resources tilting at windmills and sowing dissension over an out-of-state school that inexplicably has set its sights on Oklahoma.
We’re struggling to regulate what we do have.
There are some charter schools that do a good job educating their students, but virtual schools in particular have been criticized for their students scoring below statewide averages – in a state that already ranks near the bottom for student outcomes. 
It’s time to focus on ensuring the charter schools we do have are excelling and are financially stable. Once all of those are running well, then maybe we talk about adding more.
Because school choice is a good thing if it’s done right. 
Parents deserve assurances that state leaders are passing regulations that ensure their children will receive a quality education. And our children deserve to excel at whatever school they attend and to receive a quality education there. Because if they don’t, we’re setting them up for future failure.

For a 60-year-old Wyoming resident earning $63K a year, the average monthly ACA premium costs are increasing by 421%.
The post ‘It’s terrifying.’ Wyoming leads country with highest jump in Obamacare costs appeared first on WyoFile .","With their Affordable Care Act insurance premium costs set to rise from the current rate of $600 a month to $3,000 starting next year, Elizabeth Aranow and her husband aren’t sure what to do.
“We haven’t purchased a plan yet, because I’m reeling from sticker shock,” Aranow said. The Lander residents could buy a cheaper marketplace plan, but at $1,800 a month, the least expensive plan available still more than doubles their costs while offering less coverage. The situation has spurred them to consider major life changes, like applying for new jobs with benefits or going without insurance. 
But “to me, not having insurance is not an option,” she said. Aranow has experienced injuries that required surgeries in recent years.
Health policy changes, a shifting market and expiring tax credits mean the roughly 45,000 Wyomingites who get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are experiencing the highest price jumps in the nation. 
In Wyoming, a 60-year-old person earning roughly $63,000 is facing a 421% increase in average monthly premium costs on the ACA marketplace, according to reporting by KFF, a nonprofit that writes about health care. No other state equals or tops that percentage. The same individual would face increases of 231%, 166%, 192% and 134% if he or she lived in Montana, Colorado, Utah and Idaho, respectively. 
“It’s pretty terrifying,” Eranow said. 
Not all patients are experiencing such dramatic rises; costs depend on factors like age and annual income. But health care advocates worry that sticker shock will cause consumers to either find private plans with cheap price tags but lousy coverage or abandon insurance altogether.

“I think that we’re going to see a lot of people just not buy insurance and take the gamble that if something happens, they’ll be able to figure out how to pay it off through the hospital,” said Jenn Lowe, executive director of Healthy Wyoming, which advocates for affordable health care. 
The consequences, Lowe thinks, will be more medical debt, more uncompensated care in hospitals, increasing insurance costs for everyone, rising health issues due to patients avoiding preventative care and higher stress — which also leads to worse health outcomes. 
“All of this should be very concerning to health care consumers in the state,” she said. “Now that the expiring tax credits are coming and people are seeing in real time what the increase in costs are going to be, I think a little bit of reality is hitting  that we have some of the most expensive [health] insurance in the nation.” 
The how and why 
The Affordable Care Act marketplace, created in 2010, is available to people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer. 
In 2020, Congress created the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit during the COVID-19 pandemic to make marketplace insurance more affordable. That program provided subsidies that drastically reduced premium costs. For some low-income customers, monthly premiums went to $0.  
The program helped contribute to an all-time low in America’s uninsured rate, health advocates say. But they were not cheap — and fiscal conservatives argued they were unsustainable. Congress extended the credits in 2022, but did not extend them again this year. A deadlock over the tax credits played a significant role in the recent government shutdown. 
Expansion would have a $212 billion deficit impact on government spending over 10 years, according to a 2020 estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.
Ultimately, Congress struck a deal that did not include an extension. With the enrollment period opening Nov. 1, patients have only recently been able to log in to the system to see what their new plan options are. Open enrollment is the annual window when individuals and families can sign up for ACA health insurance, adjust plans or cancel coverage.

Insurance companies increased baseline plan costs this year. With the subsidy changes factored in, some became exponentially pricier. In addition, Mountain Health Co-op stopped offering health plans in Wyoming. That means the state is down to just two providers. 
Lowe’s organization has been holding forums around the state this fall to help educate patients about the changes. The most recent one, held last week in Casper, had the biggest attendance so far. She attributed that to people actually seeing what their increases will be.
“I heard from people who are having to make decisions about paying for rent, paying for food and being able to pay for their insurance,” Lowe said. “It’s definitely kind of scary times.”
Navigating 
The Lander Free Medical Clinic has also been hearing from patients it formerly helped set up with ACA plans. Audrey Zanetti, a medical assistant who supervises the clinic, brought up one who was on a $0 premium plan.
“It was going to auto-renew to a similar plan,” Zanetti said. Except that the new premium would have climbed from $0 to $650. That equates to about 40% of the person’s monthly income — and it doesn’t include co-pay and deductible costs. 
“And so if that individual hadn’t come in, they would have been locked into that plan, it would have autorenewed,” she said. “They would have seen the bill come January or February, and would have said, ‘I can’t afford that.’ They would have cancelled the plan, and then not been eligible [to re-enroll] because they’re outside of open enrollment.”
Health insurance is complicated, and the auto-renewal caveat is not a detail everyone is aware of. 
In the past, health “navigators” — trained professionals who guide customers through the open enrollment process — have been available largely thanks to federal funds. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services slashed that funding by 90% this year.
As a result, Enroll Wyoming, which offered free help to those seeking insurance, cut its staff from 10 people to just one full-time and one part-time employee.

To make up for some of the loss, the program has established a statewide network of organizations with health counselor training. 
“We wanted to set up a system where people could still get help,” said Enroll Wyoming Navigator Katelyn Befus. “We brought in the organizations and partners that we’ve been working with for years, and leaned on them a little bit to become certified.”
The Lander Free Medical Clinic is one of those places; VISTA Volunteer Stephanie Kohm recently completed the training. It is also holding free community sessions. 
As Enroll Wyoming’s only full-time navigator, Befus is “extremely” busy, she said. “I’m literally completely booked for appointments all the way through the first half of enrollment. So that would be all the way through Dec. 15.”
Befus has heard some frustrations from customers about prices going up. She’s done a lot of explaining about how the tax credits were designed to sunset, she said, and people are generally understanding.
However, Befus said, households that earn over 400% of the federal poverty level — $62,600 for a one-person household — are getting hit hard.
“They’re looking at extremely high premiums,” she said, like in the neighborhood of $5,000 a month for a four-person household. 
“So we’ve been having to recommend outside insurance to people over that 400% because for a lot of them, they just can’t afford that much money,” Befus said. 
Guidance and deadlines 
The deadline to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan starting Jan. 1 is Dec. 15. If customers enroll between Dec. 15 and the closing date of Jan. 15, coverage will start Feb. 1. 
Experts urge people to be deliberate. 
“I really encourage people to go to the [Healthcare.gov] website and use the ‘browse plans and prices’ tool to see what their expected tax credit and premium is before they jump in,” Befus said. 
Those who do not want to continue ACA policies need to be careful they don’t auto-renew, she added. And for people exploring private insurance, she recommends calling insurance companies directly and fully understanding plan provisions before purchasing. 
Befus stressed caution in shopping online. “There are a ton of fake and scammer websites out there,” Befus said. 
A different solution? 
Another thing people can do, Lowe said, is “Call your federal delegates and let them know that this is impacting you personally.”
In the tax credit stalemate this fall, Republicans were generally against extension while Democrats were in favor. Wyoming’s U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, a retired physician, told NBC’s Meet the Press that Obamacare is a failed measure and Republicans want to replace it with something that works to actually lower costs.

“I’ve always wanted people to get the care they need, from a doctor that they choose, at a price they can afford — and Obamacare basically destroyed that possibility,” Barrasso said. “We cannot just continue to subsidize a failing plan, which is causing more and more costs and hardship around the country.”
It’s easy to criticize Obamacare, Lowe said. What’s harder is coming up with a better solution. 
“Republicans committed to talking about health care insurance once the government reopened,” she said. “Well, guess what? The government is reopened. Let’s talk about health care insurance. You guys don’t want the marketplace. How are you going to be able to provide health care insurance to the people of Wyoming?”
Health insurance, Lowe said, creates longer and healthier lives. “It’s a policy solution that we know works.”
Now is the time to hold delegates accountable, Lowe said. “And say: ‘if not this, then what?’”

A critical deer migration corridor in western Wyoming shouldn’t be sold off for oil and gas, writes guest columnist Walt Gasson.
The post There’s some land too important to sacrifice on the altar of development appeared first on WyoFile .","Old Gus and I were coming out of the Big Sandy country in November of that year. It had been the last elk hunt of the season, and we had closed up the home place for the winter. Just in time, too. The snowstorm the night before had made the road around the north side of Little Prospect Mountain impassable, and we had to take an alternate road to hit the pavement at Farson. My hope was that we might reach the store before it closed and get an ice cream cone. I was 11, and as always, my dad’s outdoor adventure accomplice.

Opinion

We were chained up and grinding steadily forward, off the mountain and out into the land of gray and white. The wind was blowing, and there were patches of bare ground, but every big sagebrush had a mini-drift on the leeward side. There were mare’s tails of airborne snow drifting off the rockpiles of the Prospects and Little Prospect. My images of that day are in black and white, sagebrush and granite and sky. And mule deer.
They were everywhere that day, on the flanks of those cold desert mountain ranges. Little bunches, big bunches — hundreds of them. The bucks were strutting, with their big, swollen necks extended and walking that stiff-legged gait they adopt as the rut draws closer. Gus normally paid little attention to mule deer. He was an elk hunter, and a very effective one. In his world, deer were just rats with antlers. But even he had to stop the truck on the divide between Lander Creek and Little Sandy and gawk at the spectacle that unfolded before us that cold gray afternoon. 
We didn’t know it at the time — indeed, we wouldn’t know until 50 years later, when wildlife researcher Hall Sawyer opened our collective eyes — but we were witnessing the longest big game migration in the Lower 48. There were many more deer in the upper Green River country back in the mid-1960s, and the scope of this mass movement of mule deer was much greater. Thousands of deer were moving from summer ranges that extended all the way to eastern Idaho to a winter range in the desert east of Rock Springs. It was a wintertime Serengeti. 
They’ve probably been doing it for as long as their ancestors have been in the country. They leave the mountains beginning in October, moving along the west face of the Wind River Range, just about where the aspens meet the sagebrush. The does have fawns in tow, and it’s by this journey and their incredible memories that these young deer learn where to stop and rest, where to move quickly and how to surmount the obstacles in their way. Centuries ago, those obstacles were minimal. There were rivers to swim and predators to avoid or escape, but there were no fences or highways or 5-acre ranchettes.
That’s not the case now. These deer have a gauntlet of obstacles to face as they move south in the late fall, then back north in the spring. There are dozens of fences, including elk fences 8 feet tall. There are dozens of roads, some lightly travelled county roads and some high-volume paved highways. There are lakes and rivers, subdivisions and a host of other barriers. But the deer still find a way, with a little help from their friends. We’ve modified fences and created conservation easements. We’re building highway crossings and working with state, federal and private partners to keep this migration route intact. That’s the good news.
The bad news is President Donald Trump’s “national energy emergency” and the associated rush by the Department of Interior to lease parcels smack dab in the middle of this migration route for oil and gas development. For those of us who have been in the trenches of wildlife conservation in Wyoming, this is not our first rodeo. It’s not even our second or third. It’s just the latest one — the latest in a series of bad land management decisions driven by corporate interests and their friends in positions of political influence, the beneficiaries of their generous campaign contributions. When it comes to sacrificing mule deer to create corporate profit, we’re old hands here in Wyoming.
We sacrificed the deer on the New Fork Mesa — the Pinedale Anticline, to use its fossil fuel era moniker. They told us they could mitigate the damages. We sacrificed the country west of Baggs and south of Wamsutter. They told us the same thing, and it wasn’t true there either. We sacrificed the deer in the Powder River Basin to coal-bed methane and the mule deer of Star Valley to rural subdivisions. 
And the story was always the same: “We can mitigate it. They can move around it. We can impose stipulations to protect them and improve habitat off-site. Development doesn’t need to be bad for deer.” I have to say I was impressed recently with Steve Degenfelder from Kirkwood Oil and Gas. At least he was straight up honest when he said, “There’s no place that I’m going to say is a place that shouldn’t be leased.” I can grudgingly admire his chutzpah, if not his grasp of historical precedent.
Let me be very clear: I am definitely willing to say that there are places that shouldn’t be leased. There are places too special to convert from a deer migration route to a gas field. There are people like my family, four generations of Gassons, who believe that it’s more important to maintain this migration route than it is to add one more area to Wyoming’s long list of broken promises. No, Steve, there are indeed places that shouldn’t be leased, and this is damn sure one of them. 
Somewhere, on the other side of the Great Divide, Old Gus is looking at this and silently shaking his head in wonder.

(Laura Guido / Idaho Capital Sun)El-Ada Community Action Partnership has been operating since 1967 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s declaration of War on Poverty. 
The nearly completely federally funded nonprofit, amid a grant shortfall and overall volatility with federal money, recently closed its Homedale food pantry. 
The southwestern Idaho food bank that had once served the city of about 3,000 residents was too expensive to maintain as a permanent physical location, said El-Ada CAP Executive Director Katrina Vincent. 
The organization on Nov. 18 began serving community members there with a mobile pantry, which will operate the first and third Tuesdays of each month. 
“We knew that we had to make a decision about our outer offices, just to be as efficient as we can,” Vincent said in an interview. “We’re committed to being good stewards of our taxpayer money, and we’re 98% federally funded. With our outer offices, and especially out in Homedale, we don’t serve a huge number of people to have it offset the cost of operating a brick and mortar location out there.”
The month that the nonprofit’s board considered the closure, the food pantry distributed 150 food boxes to Homedale residents, she said. It cost about $100,000 a year to operate the building. 
The nonprofit also provides assistance paying energy bills and for weatherization; the organization can still provide those services remotely to the community, Vincent said. 
 Federal Community Services Block Grant in question after $130,000 shortfall 

The organization uses the federal Community Services Block Grant to pay for much of its administrative costs, like rent and electricity. The money passes from the federal government to local organizations through the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. 
This year, the organization received about $130,000 less than the year before, Vincent said. While the state Health and Welfare officials indicated the group may get the rest of the grant funding later, Vincent said, no one could be sure. Congress must approve the funding quarter, she said. 
“As we’re doing our planning for program year 2026, they really couldn’t give us a definitive answer,” Vincent said. 
Closing the Homedale location was the “least impactful” decision that the organization could make, she said. 
The Homedale food pantry, located on Colorado Avenue, was closed in early November, amid spiking demand at Idaho food banks because of a pause on federal food assistance during the federal government shutdown.

El-Ada CAP Pantry Manager James Thompson said staff was met with a lot of concern from the community. 
“Today, we had a retirement community very concerned, the school district out there very concerned,” Thompson said in an interview earlier this month. “There were some tears.” 
He said some concerns were assuaged when residents were told that the mobile food bank would continue to travel there. 
Prior to the closure, the food bank operated 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday outside a half-hour closure for lunch midday. The mobile pantry will still distribute food at the 15 W. Colorado Ave. address, now from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. the first and third Tuesdays of the month. 
The Owyhee County Mobile Pantry operates on the third Friday of each month from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. at 320 N. Sixth St. West in Homedale, and the Homedale Senior Citizens Center provides free meals for lunch around 12 p.m.  Tuesday through Thursday. The center recommends calling 208-337-3020 ahead to confirm hours, according to the Idaho Food Bank Food Assistance Locator.
 Other federal grants have been in flux amid DOGE and other Trump administration actions 

Over the spring, El-Ada CAP was one of a number of Idaho food banks affected by canceled shipments by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Orders that would’ve contained more than 370,000 pounds of products from American farmers, destined for food pantries statewide, were canceled, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Orders of more than 370,000 pounds of food for low-income Idahoans were canceled this spring

A grant that goes toward helping residents in need with their heating bills, called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and another that assists with weatherization for low-income households, were both in question earlier this year. 
In April, the administration under President Donald Trump fired the entire staff who administer the LIHEAP program, PBS reported.
The programs are reimbursable, meaning El-Ada Cap pays for the assistance and then gets eligible costs reimbursed through the federal grants. 
During the shakeup at the federal agency, reimbursement for El-Ada CAP’s program took six months, Vincent said. During that time, there was no guarantee the funding would ever come through, she said. 
“It’s been a precarious year, but because people have to have electricity and our programs help so many people, “ Vincent said, “we’re just kind of taking it day by day and being as efficient as we can.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin State Senate passed SB 553 on Tuesday, Nov. 18, in their last floor session of the year. This bill, purportedly written to define abortion, is actually a covert attempt to exclude abortion from the broader scope of reproductive healthcare. 
Anti-abortion legislators pushing this bill are attempting to play to their religious base who voted them into office to promote an anti-abortion agenda. This is a failing strategy, however, when we’ve seen in countless elections around the country that abortion access is a winning issue, including in Wisconsin. 
The bigger problem, though, is how proponents of the bill are describing it as a way to allow physicians to safely provide care and clarify abortion restrictions, by excluding medical procedures intended to save a person’s life, such as C-sections, the removal of dead embryos, and treatment for ectopic pregnancy, to name a few, from the definition of “abortion.”
Lawmakers are misleading people into thinking that this bill will further define the nuances of care that physicians provide and actually allow, rather than restrict, the provision of care. 
This could not be farther from the truth. We have too many examples nationwide of physicians practicing in states hostile to reproductive rights who are unsure about what care is legal to provide, ultimately leading to unnecessary delays in caring for pregnant people. It is telling that physicians who provide miscarriage and abortion care were not called on to write the text of this legislation. 
Nationally, we have already seen pregnant people die preventable deaths while waiting for essential care for early pregnancy complications because lawmakers stirred confusion and meddled in healthcare decisions. This bill will amplify those dangers in our state, where 13.2 people out of 100,000 die in pregnancy, childbirth, or 42 days after termination of a pregnancy. A study by researchers at the University of Washington and Massachusetts General Hospital showed that these trends, across race, have been worsening in Wisconsin since 2010. 
Black birthing people in Wisconsin account for a disproportionate amount of the disparities in maternal mortality. Adding these racial and systemic inequities to a bill that will delay care for folks across the board, it’s nearly guaranteed that certain groups will have a greater share of these poor outcomes.
As a family medicine and obstetrics physician, I care for folks across the entire spectrum of pregnancy — including miscarriage and abortion. I want to emphasize the similarities in those two scenarios and how they significantly overlap. 
The procedure performed for abortion is identical to the procedure performed for a miscarriage. When a person has a miscarriage or an abortion in the first trimester, generally, a procedure called a “manual vacuum aspiration” or “MVA” can be performed to remove the pregnancy contents. For miscarriages or abortions that occur later in pregnancy, the procedure involves dilating the cervix and removing the pregnancy via a procedure called a dilation and curettage (D&C) or dilation and evacuation (D&E), based on gestational age. 
Additionally, when managing a miscarriage with medications, physicians use mifepristone and misoprostol — medications that lawmakers and anti-abortion activists are actively seeking to restrict because they’re used identically in first-trimester abortions. 
That is the underlying, root issue here: amplifying and reinforcing stigma and criminalization around abortion. 
Carving out the definition of abortion doesn’t actually create medical clarity for providers; instead, it creates a stigmatizing health care space where patients have to disclose and justify why they need certain essential health care. People deserve care and compassion, not judgment or punishment. 
Whether due to miscarriage, abortion, or self-managed abortion, pregnancy loss is not a crime. People should not fear jail time for getting the health care they need. SB 553 aims to differentiate abortion based on intent — a dystopian concept where politicians are in the private space of a doctor’s office. Wisconsinites currently have an opportunity to combat this stigma and call out politicians who are actively harming patients and the patient/provider relationship. 
In my practice already I have seen patients who are hesitant to disclose their pregnancy history for fear that sharing a history of needing abortion care could get them in trouble. Imagine how that influences future decisions to engage with health care providers around miscarriage, abortion and pregnancy complications. 
Wisconsin already heavily regulates how medications for miscarriage are prescribed, including a mandatory in-person dispensing requirement. Those of us who offer this care should not need to feel we must pit our medical expertise against legal jargon when it comes to providing normal, essential care. We need people to be able to trust their health care providers, and we need politicians to stop making laws that pigeonhole physicians into even narrower definitions of care. 
Now that this dangerous bill has been passed in the Senate, it will next head to the Assembly before ultimately landing on Gov. Tony Evers’ desk. In his seven years in office Evers has consistently vetoed anti-abortion legislation, and he has vowed to veto any bill that would limit access to abortion, including SB 553. 
As a physician, it’s devastating to rely on a single individual to preserve my ability to practice safe and necessary health care for countless people and families across the state without political interference. 
There is no other type of health care that is regulated in the unique, stigmatizing, harmful way that abortion care is. Our state politicians need to understand that health care decisions should remain between a patient and their trusted provider. SB 553 ignores that and should not become law.

An hour later, the 19-year-old college student stood on the sidewalk outside alone, blinking back tears.
“They took my mom,” he said.
Yanim Lopez, Cogco’s mother, was one of five people detained at the courthouse after answering a summons to appear at the regular Wednesday General Sessions Court “trooper docket” reserved for traffic offenses.
All five appeared before a judge and paid their fines before being ushered into a private room, out of view. 
They reemerged about 15 minutes later, led single-file out the building’s front door by masked individuals in plain clothes who ignored a reporter’s question asking which agency employed them. All five, including Cogco’s mom, were restrained in leg shackles and handcuffs secured to chains around their waists. They were placed in a waiting white van.

Lopez is now in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she told her son in a phone call on her way to a Knoxville detention center later in the day. She said she was asked if she would voluntarily agree to be “self-deported” to Mexico, but refused. On Saturday, Lopez was transferred to a Louisiana detention facility after being denied the right to post bond, Cogco said.
“I want to bawl my eyes out, but I’ve got to stay calm for my little sister,” who is 12, Cogco said at the courthouse. 
Lopez, 38, was in the process of obtaining a “U visa” reserved for domestic violence and other crime victims when she received a citation for driving without a license, he said. Originally from Mexico, Lopez has lived in the United States since she was six-years-old, he said. 
Immigrants without legal status are ineligible to obtain a valid Tennessee drivers’ license.
In Robertson County, similar scenes of mass arrests have taken place on four or five different occasions in recent weeks immediately following the Wednesday trooper dockets, according to Roger Neil, the county’s public defender.
The practice has troubled local immigrant advocates and attorneys, who report witnessing similar arrests after misdemeanor traffic court appearances inside the Wilson County Courthouse in October. 
“All Tennesseans should be able to expect to be treated fairly when they show up to traffic court,” said Spring Miller, attorney for the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition.
“It is shameful that our local public spaces are being commandeered in service of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda, and in the long run it will make us all less safe.”
Heightened immigration enforcement in courthouses
The Trump administration in January ended a policy limiting immigration arrests in state and county courts.
In May, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons issued a memo citing advantages of making arrests inside civil and criminal court buildings that have already screened for weapons. 
Since then, reports of immigration detentions in courthouses around the country have increased, even as some Democratic-led states have challenged them.

Deportations of immigrants without legal status whose only offenses are traffic related have surged during the second Trump administration, according to the Marshall Project. The news organization reported the monthly number of people deported whose most serious offense was a traffic violation more than tripled in the first six months of this year. 
Whether federal immigration enforcement officials were alerted ahead of time to the immigration status of those scheduled to appear on the Robertson County traffic docket is unknown. 
A Robertson County clerk said she had received no requests from ICE about individuals scheduled to be in court. 
In Wilson County, the court clerk’s office sends daily docket lists to multiple agencies, including ICE, a practice that has been in place for several years, according to Kim Stewart, executive chief deputy.
‘Left this in God’s hands’
Cogco and his mother nearly left after seeing a white van parked near the court’s entrance when they arrived for the 9 a.m. hearing.
“We saw the van, and we were thinking of turning around. But if nothing happened, then she gets a warrant for arrest,” he said. 
“We were worried, but we just went ahead and left this in God’s hands to make sure she’s alright.”
Cogco’s mother, who cleans homes for a living, had been ticketed for driving without a license on her way home to Nashville from visiting relatives in Robertson County, he said.

Inside the courtroom, Robertson County General Sessions Judge Joel Perry called up individuals one by one to answer for traffic violations that included speeding more than 20 miles over the limit, using a cell phone while driving and driving without a license.
Lopez pleaded guilty to the driving-without-a-license violation, receiving the same penalty Perry meted out repeatedly that morning: a $50 fine, $10 in court fees, online traffic school and eight hours of community service on the county’s “trash van.”
“Take a seat in the front,” he instructed Lopez, directing her to sit beside others who had also just pleaded guilty to traffic violations.
Less than an hour into the hearing, with Lopez and four others who would soon be detained seated in front of the courtroom, Perry called a recess and left the room. 
A uniformed officer stepped into the courtroom and called out the names of Lopez and others seated beside her. The group was then escorted out to a pay window to pay their fines.
Perry did not respond to a message left with his office last week seeking information about his role in Wednesday’s detentions.
Lopez followed the court deputy to a payment window in the court’s hallway. After paying her fine, Lopez was escorted by an officer to another room, out of public view.
Cogco caught a brief glimpse of what happened next. 
“They took her to the room, and I couldn’t understand,” he said. “But then I saw that they had the handcuffs, and that’s when I knew.”
“All she said was ‘just to take care of my sister, let my family know, and just take care of my little sister,’” Cogco said. 
Lopez was last in the line of five detainees escorted in a line out the entrance door of the Robertson County courthouse about 15 minutes later in leg restraints and handcuffs, escorted by five plain-clothed individuals wearing neck masks hiked up to cover their nose and mouths.
Asked where their detainees were being taken, one masked woman responded “Homeland Security in Nashville. You can follow us if you want.”
‘It’s only me and my sisters’
Aurora Leao, 46, in court for a ticket for driving without a license, also emerged in the line of chained and shackled detainees brought to the white van.
Elizabeth Leao, her 21-year-old daughter, could barely speak between heaving sobs as she stood in the courthouse parking lot, trying to reach family members on her phone. 
“Oh God,” she said, sobbing uncontrollably.
“I wasn’t even expecting this,” she said. “I really thought that nothing was going to happen. It’s only me and my sisters.”

Aurora Leao, originally from Mexico, has lived in the United States for 22 years, her daughter said. She phoned her daughter later on Wednesday to say she was detained in Knoxville, Elizabeth Leao said.
“I’m not sure how long they’ll have her there before possibly being transferred to Louisiana,” Elizabeth Leao wrote via text Thursday. “I’m trying to find an attorney but it (is) hard to know which one to go with and if I should wait for her to be transferred and get a hearing there,” 
A spokesperson for ICE on Thursday declined to answer questions about the Robertson County courthouse arrests, citing “operational security.”
“As part of its routine operations, ICE arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” Angelina Vicknair, the spokesperson, wrote in an emailed response.
“All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality,” she wrote.

All five of the individuals detained, including Leao and Lopez, had entered guilty pleas to driving offenses before being detained, adding a criminal mark to their record just before their immigration arrests.
Driving without a license is a misdemeanor criminal offense. So, too, are most traffic offenses in Tennessee, unlike most other states that classify traffic offenses as civil infractions, said Jerry Gonzalez, a Nashville criminal defense attorney unconnected to the Robertson County Court detentions last week.
“After they plead guilty to a traffic offense, the government can legitimately say they are ‘criminals’” he said.

Indiana’s Medicaid agency currently considers Brader “medically frail,” giving her access to an expanded set of benefits. (Chris Bergin for KFF Health News)Eliza Brader worries she soon will need to prove she’s working to continue receiving Medicaid health coverage. She doesn’t think she should have to.
The 27-year-old resident of Bloomington, Indiana, has a pacemaker and a painful joint disease. She also has fused vertebrae in her neck from a spinal injury, preventing her from turning her head.
Indiana’s Medicaid agency currently considers Brader “medically frail,” giving her access to an expanded set of benefits, such as physical therapy.
New federal rules will require more than 18 million Medicaid enrollees nationwide to show they’re working, volunteering, or going to school for 80 hours a month starting in 2027 to keep their coverage. Brader is exempt as long as she’s deemed medically frail.
But lacking sufficient federal guidance, states are wrestling with how to define medical frailty — a consequential decision that could cut Medicaid coverage for many people, said state officials, consumer advocates, and health policy researchers.
“It’s terrifying,” Brader said. “I already have fought so hard to get my health care.”
‘Incredibly High’ Stakes
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act slashes nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade, with much of the savings projected to come from no longer covering those who don’t qualify under the new work rules. Those spending cuts help offset the costs of GOP priorities, such as extra border security and tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy.
Conservative lawmakers have argued that Medicaid, the government health insurance program for people with low incomes or with disabilities, has grown too large and expensive, especially in the wake of its expansion to more low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act. They also say that requiring participants to work is common sense.
The work rules in Trump’s tax-and-spending law offer exemptions for several groups who might struggle to meet them, including people deemed “medically frail.” The law spells out certain “medically frail” conditions such as blindness, disability, and substance use disorder. But it does not list many others.
Senators send Medicaid work requirements to governor’s desk

Instead, the law exempts those with a “serious or complex medical condition,” a term whose interpretation could vary by state. 
State officials say they need more clarity to ensure that people who cannot work for health reasons retain rightful access to Medicaid. They also worry that, even with a clear definition, people will face the onerous task of having to regularly vouch for being medically frail, which is a challenge without reliable access to medical care.
“The stakes are incredibly high,” said Kinda Serafi, a partner at consulting firm Manatt Health.
The new work requirements will affect Medicaid recipients in 42 states and Washington, D.C. Eight states — Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming — did not expand their Medicaid programs to cover additional low-income adults, so they won’t have to implement the work rules.
The Medicaid work rules are expected to be the largest driver of health insurance coverage losses over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Forty-four percent of all adults covered by states’ expanded Medicaid programs have at least one chronic health condition, according to KFF.
A Challenge for States
State Medicaid agencies are scrambling to implement the rules with little direction from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has yet to issue specific guidance. Federal officials will clarify the “medically frail” definition next year, said Andrew Nixon, an agency spokesperson.
Ultimately, states will have to decide who is unhealthy enough to be exempt from work rules. And it won’t be easy for state workers and their computer systems to track.
Every year, state eligibility systems screen millions of applicants to check if they qualify for Medicaid and other government programs. Now, these same systems must screen applicants and existing enrollees to determine whether they meet the new work rules. 
Jessica Kahn, a partner at consulting firm McKinsey & Co., has urged states to start planning how to adapt eligibility systems to verify work status. States can do a “tremendous amount” of work without direction from the federal government, said Kahn, a former federal Medicaid systems official, who spoke during a recent Medicaid advisory panel hearing. “Time is a-wasting already.”
State Medicaid directors are pondering the challenge.
“Medical frailty gets so complex,” Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director, said during a recent panel discussion. Conditions that can keep people from working, such as mental health disorders, can be hard to prove, she said.
A state might try to use a person’s health records, for instance, to determine medical frailty. But a patient’s chart may not paint a clear picture of someone’s health, especially if they lack regular access to medical care.
It’s a tall order for eligibility systems that historically have not had to scrape medical records to screen applicants, said Serafi of Manatt Health.










That is an incredibly new thing that eligibility enrollment systems are just not fluent in at all.


– Don't forget to add author


Lobbying groups for the private health insurance companies that help run Medicaid in many states also have urged federal regulators to clearly define medical frailty so it can be applied uniformly.
In a Nov. 3 letter to federal officials, the Medicaid Health Plans of America and the Association for Community Affiliated Plans advocated for allowing enrollees to qualify for the exemption by saying on their applications that they have conditions that make them medically frail. Successfully implementing exemptions for the medically frail will be “crucial” given the “severe health risks of coverage loss for these populations,” the groups said.
Some state officials worry about unintended consequences of the work rules for people with chronic conditions.
Jennifer Strohecker, who recently resigned as Utah’s Medicaid director, reiterated the high stakes, especially for those with diabetes on Medicaid. They may be very healthy and functional with insulin, but if they fail to complete the work requirements, that may change, Strohecker said during a recent Medicaid advisory hearing. 
Whether someone is deemed medically frail already depends heavily on where they live.
For example, in Arkansas, people indicate on their Medicaid applications that they’re disabled, blind, or need help with daily living activities.
Approximately 6% of the roughly 221,000 people enrolled in Arkansas’ Medicaid expansion program are deemed medically frail, according to Gavin Lesnick, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Human Services.
In West Virginia, the state accepts a medical frailty designation when an applicant self-reports it.

The burden of proof is higher in North Dakota. Applicants there must answer a questionnaire about their health and submit additional documentation, which may include medical chart notes and treatment plans. More than half of applicants were denied last year, according to Health and Human Services Department spokesperson Mindy Michaels.
Indiana’s Family and Social Services Administration, which runs its Medicaid program, declined an interview and said it could not comment on individual cases, like Brader’s.
Brader worries the additional red tape will cause her to lose Medicaid again. She said she was temporarily kicked off the program in 2019 for failing to meet the state’s work rules when Indiana said her work-study job didn’t count as employment.
“Anytime I have tried to receive help from the state of Indiana, it has been a bureaucratic nightmare,” she said.
As states await federal guidance, Kristi Putnam, a senior fellow at the conservative Cicero Institute and former secretary of the Arkansas Department of Human Services, which oversees the state Medicaid program, said even if a state creates an extensive list of qualifying “medically frail” conditions, the line must be drawn somewhere.
“You can’t possibly create a policy for exemptions that will catch everything,” she said.

Greg Tehven, chair of the Grand Farm board, said the top priority is building up the facilities and infrastructure on the research campus west of Casselton.
“It increases our capacity for more testing of technology for farmers, more partners to engage, the ability to have more trials on site and deeper collaboration with both public and private sector,” Tehven said.

The funding is through the state Commerce Department’s Autonomous Agriculture Grant Program. The state Legislature in 2021 made $10 million in federal funds available for the program. Grand Farm was the sole recipient of that grant round. 
The money helped build the first building at Grand Farm, a 25,000-square-foot Innovation Shop. 
This year, there were 16 applications for $7.5 million made available by the Legislature.
In addition to Grand Farm, the Commerce Department awarded $500,000 to Kansas-based Greenfield Robotics. The company is developing robots to control weeds without using herbicides. 
It is one of the companies that have participated in Grand Farm autonomous technology demonstrations. 
Robotic weeding, using drones and incorporating data from soil sensors and images to feed into artificial intelligence are some of the components of autonomous farming. The state also has provided money for a program to use drones to scout for weeds. 
“We anticipate more application of artificial intelligence solutions that can keep our farms efficient, financially healthy, safe and allow our producers to have the best tool possible to do what’s best for their farm,” said Tehven, co-founder of Emerging Prairie, a Fargo-based technology company. 
Grand Farm celebrates first building to foster ag innovation

Miki Miheguli is the director of agronomy and research at the North Dakota Soybean Council who served on a committee that evaluated the grant applications.
“From field-scale research to the infrastructure that enables commercialization, these strategic investments drive cutting-edge technology development and accelerate its real-world adoption, ensuring North Dakota remains at the forefront of agricultural innovation,” Miheguli said in a news release. 
Tehven said Grand Farm now has about 80 ag industry partners such as AGCO and North Dakota State University. 
 He said the next phase of development will help that grow. 
“This allows us to attract companies’ investments and deeper research activity right here in our backyard,” Tehven said.

	The most extreme disruptions will likely be felt by Coloradans who purchase coverage on Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace established under the Affordable Care Act. Because of the nonrenewal of enhanced premium tax credits by the Republican-controlled Congress, average premiums for marketplace plans are set to double as of Jan. 1, according to state estimates released last month.
Roughly 285,000 Coloradans purchase their health coverage from one of six insurers that offer plans on the individual marketplace, established under the Affordable Care Act to serve consumers who are self-employed or otherwise don’t receive insurance from their employers.
But the millions of Coloradans insured through an employer-sponsored plan could also be affected. Health benefit costs for employers are expected to rise by an average of 9% in 2026, according to a survey by consulting firm Mercer.
That’s the largest increase in 15 years, and it’s likely to cause many employers to change to higher-deductible plans, require employees to cover a greater share of premiums, or cease to provide insurance for some or all of their employees altogether. Nearly 60% of employers told Mercer that they plan to take cost-cutting measures on health benefits in 2026.

There are also storm clouds on the horizon for Health First Colorado, the state’s Medicaid program, which serves about 1.1 million lower-income Coloradans. The impacts of the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts passed by congressional Republicans in 2025 will be phased in over the next several years, with the biggest disruptions likely to come in January 2027. But the state is already scrambling to deal with ballooning Medicaid costs and state revenue shortfalls resulting from the GOP tax cut and spending law enacted in July. Gov. Jared Polis’ proposed 2026 budget would reduce projected Medicaid spending by $330 million through measures like a cap on dental benefits.
Lower-income Coloradans and people in rural areas could bear the brunt of the immediate fallout in 2026. But state officials and health policy experts say that the consequences of lost coverage — overall, nearly 200,000 people in Colorado are projected to become uninsured as a result of Republican policy changes — will be felt by everyone.
“They’re still going to get sick, they’re still going to end up in the hospital — that’s going to drive uncompensated care,” Michael Conway, the Colorado insurance commissioner, said of people who lose their insurance during a town hall in October. “That uncompensated care in hospitals, that’s going to be transferred out into the entirety of the marketplace.”
“There isn’t a corner of our health care system that is going to be safe from the impact of the loss of these subsidies,” he added.

(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)Last week there was some hopeful communication from Washington, D.C., for our agricultural communities in southeast Idaho. 
In a video-taped message, reported by the Idaho Falls Post Register on Nov. 14, U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, spoke about farm labor needs to southeast Idaho dairymen and farmers who gathered in Idaho Falls to discuss agricultural labor shortages in Idaho. 
Idaho U.S. Sens. Risch, Crapo join request for more guest visas to support seasonal workforce 

“Simpson spoke about the current Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2025 bill in the U.S. House that aims to stabilize the agricultural workforce by providing a path to legal status for current farmworkers, reforming the H-2A guest worker program and mandating a national E-Verify system for agricultural employment,” the Post Register reported.
Currently, the H-2A program provides temporary work visas for individuals coming to the U.S. as seasonal or temporary (less than one year) workers in the agricultural industry. Extensions to these visa times are possible when emergency labor shortages occur. There are many problems with the current system; the Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 3227) will address some of the most pressing issues.
The Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 3227) was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on May 7, 2025. The bill has not been voted on as of Nov. 15, 2025. 
This bill is a positive step forward for those involved in agriculture both because of its substance and the process it will create. Rep. Simpson said in his video-taped message that passing this bill is currently one of his most important goals. 
A little background: In 2022, the USDA commissioned a study to understand the problems within the H-2A system from the perspectives of employers and employees. The United Farmworkers were contracted to do this research, and they subsequently came out in support of H.R. 3227 when it was submitted to the House on May 7, 2025.
According to the USDA study, for employers — the cost of working within the H-2A system program is a significant barrier. At each stage of hiring from abroad, the employer pays fees and completes large amounts of bureaucratic paperwork; the system is slow and costly. Employers also stated that changes need to be made to the E-Verify system of identity verification to make the process more reliable and easier to navigate. 
Employers interviewed for the USDA study also noted the need for year-round visas. This kind of visa would be very useful for the dairy industry in states like Idaho, since cows need to be milked year-round, among other industry-specific circumstances. Currently there is not a visa for foreign born workers to be hired to work year-round. 
The H-2A system was created with the idea of a migrant workforce moving between different harvests as the need arose. This conceptualization of farm work is out of date; technology and mechanization have created significant changes in the industry over the decades since this program was put in place. Vegetable packing plants, meat-processing plants and associated transportation and service jobs all are necessary parts of “agriculture.” Work visas need to reflect this changing labor needs. 
For employees interviewed for the study, some problems with the current H-2A system include the need for families to be able to work and live in the U.S. together, as families — thus, the need for a family-based visa option. The agricultural workers interviewed for this study also cited the need for affordable and safe housing, fair wages and a path toward citizenship based on years of employment. Long-term employment is a goal of most individuals as is settling in a community, raising kids and being a contributing member of society. 
The substance of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 3227) addresses ways to start fixing many of the issues that were identified for employees and employers in the agricultural sector. 
The process of implementing H.R. 3227 would, importantly, = create the basis for dialogue between employers and employees at a time when our nation is seeing a rise in immigration surveillance and detention and increased strife between different sectors of our communities. 
Having the various stakeholders from the agricultural community, employers and employees and other community members sitting down and working together to implement changes such as those outlined in the Farm Workforce Modernization Act is a process that will require effort and acts of trust from everyone. This dialogue, with concrete results, could be a way forward out of the increasingly polarized and confrontational encounters that we are seeing in our communities in Idaho and across the nation. 
Working toward common goals is a way forward for our Idaho agricultural communities to create better, more productive work and living situations for all.

Mississippi regulators, though, aren’t monitoring air emissions from those 18 turbines because they fall into a “temporary-mobile” category.","SOUTHAVEN – Jason Haley, who’s lived in his Southaven home for the last two decades, in August started to hear a whirring, mechanical noise from outside that sounded like a leaf blower. 
The noise would go on for days at a time and through the night, he told Mississippi Today. He soon realized the sounds were coming from a cluster of natural gas turbines about a half mile away.
Over the summer, billionaire Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company set up shop in north Mississippi, erecting dozens of turbines on the site of a former power plant to fuel two data centers just up the road in Memphis. 
In 2024, the company, xAI, finished construction on the first center, Colossus, which it claims houses the “world’s biggest supercomputer.” Colossus holds over 200,000 computer chips powering the AI chatbot Grok. The company is now building the second iteration, Colossus II, near the Mississippi state line. To help power the operation, xAI planted 59 natural gas turbines in Southaven. 
Eighteen turbines are currently running, as the company awaits permit approval through the state for the remainder. Mississippi regulators, though, aren’t monitoring air emissions from those 18 turbines because they fall into a “temporary-mobile” category. 
The designation means they aren’t subject to air emissions oversight as long as they operate for less than a year, state regulators told Mississippi Today. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality said it adopted standards used by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
But some, including people living near the Southaven power generators, disagreed with MDEQ’s approach and argued a lack of enforcement and transparency will force them to breathe unsafe air. 
“This isn’t some far away industrial site, this is smack in the middle of a suburban area,” said lifelong Southaven resident Shannon Samsa. She is especially worried about the impact of particulates from the turbines on kids at the multiple schools within a 3-mile radius from the plant.
Debate over EPA air pollution rules
Natural gas turbines are considered cleaner than coal but still release air pollutants such as nitrous oxides and particulate matter. Exposure to those can lead to heart and lung complications, the EPA says.
Amanda Garcia, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, argued MDEQ’s basis for allowing the temporary turbines to run without permits is flawed and violates the federal Clean Air Act. The turbines fall under the EPA’s “New Source Performance Standards” and need to be treated as a “stationary” source, she argued.
“While (the EPA) hasn’t weighed in directly, they’ve made pretty clear their interpretation is these large combustion turbines are subject to New Source Performance Standards, which means they need to get a permit,” said Garcia, who also led litigation from the NAACP over temporary turbines xAI placed in Memphis. 
Last year, Garcia’s group made the same argument to officials in Shelby County, where Memphis is located, over xAI needing permits for the generators. In January, the company finally applied for permits for its Memphis turbines, and then moved others to Mississippi, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
The Memphis metropolitan area, which includes Southaven, already has smog-pollution levels that surpass federal standards, Garcia said. 
“One of our big concerns was that this huge unpermitted installation of gas turbines had become the largest source of smog forming pollution in Shelby County, and we have the same concern about the installation in Southaven,” she said. 
Last December, the EPA proposed amending emissions standards for different types of turbines. In a statement to Mississippi Today, the EPA did not address whether MDEQ had properly applied current federal standards. 
“EPA is working expeditiously to issue a final rule,” said the agency. 
The EPA statement also criticized Democratic members of Congress over the recently ended government shutdown, saying the “Democrat shutdown disrupted critical functions of our agency and others across the federal government.”
When asked for a response to Garcia’s argument over EPA’s standards, MDEQ replied in an e-mail to Mississippi Today, “It would not be appropriate for MDEQ to engage in a legal debate through this means.”
Residents yet to see noise mitigation
Haley, living near the turbines, said he hopes something can be done to limit the noise. The temporary turbines have another nine months before they reach their one-year limit. 
“I can’t live here like this for another nine months. It’s going to drive me crazy,” Haley said, adding he’s filed noise complaints, talked with the police department and emailed the mayor. 
Friends suggested he sell his house and move. He likes his house and worries about his neighbors who aren’t in a financial position to move. But if the noise continues, he believes he might not have a choice. 
In a Nov. 19 email to Mississippi Today, Southaven Mayor Darren Musselwhite said, “The noise is mostly temporary construction noise that will go away within days. xAI has assured the City that any and all necessary adjustments will be made within days to mitigate any noise and not negatively impact surrounding developments and neighborhoods in any way.”
A Mississippi Today reporter recorded sounds at 7 p.m. on Nov. 12 of a constant loud humming noise easily heard from homes in the Colonial Hills subdivision of Southaven half a mile from the xAI power plant. Reporters also reviewed recordings by Southaven residents of similar sounds heard on different dates.
When Samsa heard that xAI would be operating a power plant two miles from her home, she was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. She’d heard about environmental concerns surrounding xAI’s data centers in Memphis, where residents have pushed for stricter air quality monitoring.
Samsa remembers thinking that after everything that happened in Memphis, public officials would take steps to protect Southaven residents. While Musselwhite has assured the generators will have a “very low” environmental risk, she’s found the lack of public information around the turbines’ impacts worrying. 
“If a project is truly healthy and safe, why not be transparent about it,” Samsa said. 
The 41 permanent turbines will have a maximum generation capacity of 1,200 megawatts, while the temporary generators will only be able to reach about 400 megawatts, MDEQ told Mississippi Today in an email. 
While notifying xAI that the temporary turbines fall into a special criteria precluding them from emissions limits, MDEQ in a July letter “implored” the company to “operate … in a manner that minimizes the emission” of nitrous oxides and particulate matter.
“In conversations we’ve had with (xAI), I think they have the right intentions,” MDEQ director Chris Wells later told Mississippi Today. 
Mississippi Today reached out to xAI with questions about emission controls and noise complaints and received what appeared to be an automated message that said, “Legacy Media Lies.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20094651/AP25128659328597.jpg,,,2025-11-24 06:57:03.498080

A federal judge has declined to block ongoing book bans at one of Tennessee’s largest school districts before a full trial next year.
In April, after months of heated school board meetings and district schools pulling more than 140 books from library shelves, three high school students sued the Rutherford County Board of Education. The students, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, argued in initial filings the book bans violated their First Amendment rights and disadvantaged students by blocking them from accessing “crucial, acclaimed, and historical works.”
Judge Eli Richardson denied a preliminary injunction this week, declining to block the district from limiting access to books until the full trial plays out and indicating that the defendants have an uphill battle in the case.
“Here, the Board (or for that matter the State writ large) has not prohibited students from reading the books or acquiring them elsewhere; instead it has merely opted not to carry them on school library bookshelves,” Richardson wrote.
Attorneys for both parties declined to comment on the ruling on Thursday.
The Rutherford County case, which also includes the literary and free expression group PEN America as a plaintiff, is the first legal challenge to Tennessee’s expanded school book statute in 2024 that culled hundreds of books from school shelves.
Rutherford County book removals include “Beloved,” a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the horrors of American slavery that includes depictions of sexual violence, and “Catch-22,” a satirical World War II novel. Both books have been recommended in Advanced Placement literature classes curricula in previous years.
The Republican-backed legislature used a state obscenity law to prohibit any school material that “in whole or in part contains descriptions or depictions of sexual excitement, sexual conduct, excess violence, or sadomasochistic abuse” or is “patently offensive.”
But guidance for interpreting the law was limited when schools were required to implement it last fall. Critics wondered if books depicting classic art with nude figures or books about puberty education could be included in the ban and questioned who gets to define “excess” violence or offensive content. The ACLU of Tennessee warned the law would be wielded by some who wanted to ban books that address race, racism, LGBTQ+ rights, and marginalized groups.
Other removals in Rutherford County include “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” a popular young adult novel in which a supporting character is gay, and “Wicked,” the popular retelling of Wizard of Oz.
A 2024 survey of members of the Tennessee Association of School Librarians found that more than 1,100 titles were removed in just a few months, as schools grappled with how to interpret the newly expanded law. PEN America named Tennessee as among the top 3 states with the largest number of book bans in the last school year.
A review in The Tennessean earlier this year found book removals surged in the past year, with 1,155 unique titles either fully removed from school libraries or heavily age-restricted between December 2023 and January 2025.
A full trial in the Rutherford County case is not expected to begin until next fall.

Kentucky’s child advocates are pointing to recent increases in abuse of children in licensed child care centers as more evidence that the workforce is overworked, underpaid and each worker is responsible for too many children. 
From 2022 to 2024, the number of children who suffered serious injuries increased from 466 to 764, according to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Additionally, cases of substantiated abuse and neglect increased from 37 in 2022 to 47 in 2023 and 64 in 2024. Licensed child care capacity increased from nearly 159,000 children in 2022 to 164,000 in 2024. 
A paper from Kosair for Kids and Kentucky Youth Advocates, published last week, blames this increase on low wages, inadequate training, an entry-level workforce, staff stress and more. 
Several recent incidents of mistreatment made headlines. A Leitchfield child care worker was arrested in March after reportedly pulling a child’s hair out, resulting in a bald spot. In Richmond, a child care worker — one of several arrested — was accused of restraining a child and covering the child’s nose and mouth, according to April news reports.

Sarah Vanover, the study author and policy and research director for Kentucky Youth Advocates, said too many classrooms are maxed out on their adult-to-child ratios, another key point of stress for many teachers. At the same time, many child care centers are operating at a loss because their cost is more expensive than what many families can afford.
“The same way that we see parents who have higher stress situations at home, they escalate to abuse,” Vanover said. “The same thing happens in child care programs.” 
The children at highest risk of suffering from this “perfect storm” of negative factors are kids with disabilities, she said.

About 1 in 5 children has a diagnosed disability, Vanover said, which comes with its own unique challenges. Neurodivergent children may have a strong fight or flight reaction, she said, which could lead them to run away from the classroom. 
“We could see children that have speech delays and may become aggressive because they don’t know how to verbally communicate, so they may communicate physically with their peers,” she said. 
Some children may not have the tools to self-soothe and, as a result, cry constantly. 
“When you listen to crying nonstop, all day long, that can be a huge stressor and very overwhelming,” Vanover said. “So there’s a wide variety of those behaviors, but a lot of the most challenging ones relate to kiddos that have a hard time calming down, so they stay upset, and they may be aggressive with teachers or peers.” 
Kentucky’s staff-to-child ratio requirements for licensed centers vary by age and are set at:

Infants (6 weeks to 12 months) — 1:5 
Toddlers (12 months to 24 months) — 1:6 
Two-year-olds (24 months to 36 months) — 1:10 
Three-year-olds (36 to 48 months) —1:12 
Four-year-olds (48 to 60 months) — 1:14 
School-age children (kindergarten+) — 1:15

The National Association for the Education of Young Children recommends slightly lower ratios, which Vanover said would be ideal. 
Kentucky’s adult-to-child ratio for 2-year-olds is the nation’s worst at 1:10 with a maximum group size of 20, says the paper. Children this age are typically still not independent in the bathroom and may need help at meal times while the provider is still required to implement curriculum.
Wages are one of the biggest barriers to child care staffing, the paper says. ​​One study found that the median wage for child care providers in Kentucky was just under $14.00 per hour, or $29,060 annually, with many child care programs unable to offer health insurance or other benefits to staff. (Screenshot)
“When you think about a parent just bringing home a new baby and feeling overwhelmed with one child,” she said, “then try to imagine an adult in a room with four infants trying to feed them and take care of them and meet all those needs.” 
The downstream effects 
When abuse happens in child care facilities, Vanover said, it harms not only the child, but families, the community and the child care infrastructure. Abuse leaves families without the support that allows many to work, for example.  
“A parent is easily going to quit work compared to leaving their child in some place that they don’t feel is safe,” she said. “And when a family member leaves the workplace, whether it’s a two parent family, one parent family, there’s that additional financial struggle. It could mean that a family loses their health care. It could mean that a family needs to apply for SNAP and TANF and Medicaid and resources that are already really sparse right now. When we’re thinking about the family being independent and autonomous, we really want them to be able to have accessible child care so that they can go to work and support their family and make sure that all the family needs are met, whether that’s housing, food or medical care.” 
Policy recommendations 
Kentucky could improve conditions in centers for children, Vanover said, if child care workers were required to spend three of their 15 annual professional development training hours on special education training. There is currently no requirement that they get special education training, she said. This requirement could be codified in law without an extra cost for the state, she said. 
With more funding, child care centers could also raise wages and have tighter teacher-student ratios. Wages are one of the biggest barriers to child care staffing, the paper says. ​​One study found that the median wage for child care providers in Kentucky was just under $14.00 per hour, or $29,060 annually, with many child care programs unable to offer health insurance or other benefits to staff. 
KYA isn’t making a specific budget request of the General Assembly for this item in 2026, Vanover said, but is calling on more businesses to participate in the Employee Child-Care Assistance Partnership program, or ECAP, which incentivizes employers to help employees pay for child care.
“We were thrilled with the additional investment that the General Assembly put in two years ago during the last budget session,” Vanover said, “and it’s a priority for us to make sure that we maintain those funds.”

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)Citing a slew of violent acts against Black community members, a group of West Virginia attorneys has called on Charleston City Council to investigate several police officers. 
They are right to demand real accountability.
Trent Redman, Rico Moore, Geoff Cullop, and Olobunmi Kusimo-Frazier raised the issue in a letter and in comments to city council at a Monday meeting. The incidents include punching a Black teenager in the face, forcibly pushing a Black woman to the ground to enter a home, and using a police vehicle to chase and strike a Black man on a scooter. 
“One thing about being an attorney here, everybody – especially in my community, the Black community – they know me,” Moore said, according to a Gazette-Mail story about the meeting. “I got tired of receiving phone calls, complaints about specific policemen, and we see this happen over and over. These officers, these individuals, get moved from place to place and the problem is never really addressed.” 
Moore continued: “This is not a situation where – as an attorney – I’m coming to you and I’m saying pay my clients. That’s not what I’m looking for. What I’m looking for is some real accountability from the city council and the police department.” 
Frazier described the incidents as “extrajudicial punishment.” Cullop called the behavior of the officers “sadistic.” 
This is far from the first time city officials have been made aware of this kind of horrific behavior. Unfortunately, officials’ past responses can only be described as performative.
These past measures have not fixed the long-standing issues of violence towards Black people by Charleston Police. It’s time for a reckoning. 
In 2016, a group called Call to Action for Racial Equality (CARE) conducted a study that found Black people account for 28-30 percent of arrests in Charleston despite making up just 12 percent of the city’s population. 
In response, the city planned implicit bias trainings, formed partnerships with some Black community leaders, and committed to collecting data about demographics (including race) during police encounters. (A follow up by ACLU-WV Investigative Reporter Kyle Vass in 2023 found that this data was only collected about 50 percent of the time since the city committed to the practice.)
In 2020 when Charleston Police brutalized an unarmed Black woman, Mayor Amy Goodwin assured the community that the city would do more to address racial profiling. The mayor formed a short-lived coalition without making any substantive changes to policing practices.
Clearly the measures attempted so far are insufficient. 
The officers involved in the incidents outlined in the attorneys’ letter previously served on the Special Enforcement Unit, which Police Chief Scott Dempsey said was disbanded in July. He added that the department is now assembling a “Strategic Response Unit” that will comprise different officers than the enforcement unit. 
A rebrand isn’t going to cut it here. The department needs to send a strong statement to the communities it polices if it wants to maintain any credibility whatsoever. 
Goodwin and Dempsey assure us that the incidents are being investigated, but investigated by whom? The same department that allowed them to happen in the first place? The same department that thought a sensitivity training would keep people safe from racist cops? 
Dozens of cities across the country have formed citizen review boards – bodies composed of everyday people who are able to review the actions of officers and, if necessary, recommend disciplinary action. But the West Virginia Legislature has forbidden citizen review boards from having any real power under the police civil service law. 
For example, Morgantown’s Civilian Police Review and Advisory Board, “doesn’t have the power to investigate specific incidents of police misconduct. The board looks at the overall policies and practices of the police department,” according to the city website. 
This law needs to change if we want to keep our communities safe from out-of-control cops. 
In the meantime, the attorneys who addressed the council are right. Real action needs to be taken, and these officers need to be held to the highest of standards.

Transportation remains the biggest source of Rhode Island’s carbon emissions. (Rhode Island Department of Transportation Traffic Camera)Rhode Island needs to put the pedal to the metal on its clean energy transition — while reducing its reliance on driving  — if it wants to achieve its own decarbonization mandates, according to a new report by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM).
The 9.52 million metric tons of carbon dioxide produced from travel, buildings, and other human activity across Rhode Island in 2023 marks a 1.4% increase over 2022 level emissions, according to the 41-page analysis published Friday.
Even worse: The long-term pace of progress, while showing modest reductions in emissions, is too slow to meet deadlines set under the state’s Act on Climate law. 
The 2021 decarbonization mandate requires that Rhode Island achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, with incremental progress markers, including a 45% reduction from 1990 levels by 2030. 
If Rhode Island continues to decrease its fossil fuel reliance at the same rate as it has over the last five years, it will miss the 2030 target, while further jeopardizing its 2050 goal, the report warns.
“Significant decarbonization of transportation, electricity consumption, and buildings are instrumental to attain net-zero emissions by mid-century,” the report states.
The warning comes amid major shifts in federal incentives and policies under the Trump administration that are expected to make state clean energy mandates harder to achieve.
“The Trump administration’s rollback of clean-energy initiatives and its cuts to billions of dollars in funding have intentionally undermined the clean-energy future for states across the nation,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement Friday. “As federal policies continue to shift, we will keep working with our partners to chart a practical and responsible path forward on reducing emissions.”

Leading the way is the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council, a consortium of state agencies charged with helping Rhode Island meet its decarbonization mandates.
Initial projections reported by the council suggested the state was poised to fall short of that 2030 milestone, though the 2022 report emphasized that the model was “simple” and “preliminary.” A more detailed report will be published by the end of this year, informed in part by the latest state greenhouse gas emissions.
Terry Gray, DEM director and chair of the council, called the latest emissions results “disappointing,” but noted that it mirrors national trends which saw a rise in travel-related emissions in 2023.
Problem with collecting airport data 
Transportation remains the biggest culprit of Rhode Island’s carbon emissions, responsible for 37% of emissions in 2023 overall. The main driver was highway vehicle emissions, which jumped more than 6% over the prior year, according to data reported by the Rhode Island Division of Statewide Planning. While the increase partly reflects a resurgence in Rhode Island-registered vehicles, it also may be due to better reporting since the state switched from federal to state-level data sources, according to DEM’s report.

As ground travel came into focus, airplane emissions data became a guessing game because the Rhode Island Airport Corp. (RIAC) declined to provide emissions data associated with Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport, according to DEM’s report. The “abrupt switch” in refusing to release data mandated by state law in turn forced the state environmental agency to estimate plane emissions based on federal fuel reports, which are less accurate.
The report did not explain why the state’s quasi-public airport agency stopped supplying data.
“It is critical to the scientific integrity of this publication that RIAC provides DEM with complete aircraft operations data for all six state airports,” the report stated.
Bill Fischer, a spokesperson for the airport corporation, said the report’s assertion that the agency declined to provide data was inaccurate. Fischer instead explained that the state law mandating air quality reports expired in July 2023, and that without it, the airport corporation no longer had legal authority to spend money gathering and reporting emissions data under federal aviation law.
“It is also important to understand why the reporting requirement expired,” Fischer wrote in an email Friday afternoon. “After 14 years of data collection and analysis — including data from the COVID-19 period when aviation activity dropped dramatically — no causal link was established between airport operations and the health impacts cited in Warwick. This further demonstrated that airport activity was not the primary driver of those readings.”
Fischer also said aircraft operations data necessary for emissions modeling was publicly available on the corporation’s website.
But the expired statute does not exempt the airport corporation, nor any other state department, agency or commission, from complying with the rules of the Act on Climate law, Evan LaCross, a spokesperson for the Department of Environmental Management, said in an emailed response Friday night. The law offers general language authorizing state groups to develop their own rules and regulations to comply with decarbonization mandates. As DEM reads it, providing “complete aircraft operations emissions data” falls into the airport corporation’s authority and duty, LaCross said.
Home heating, electricity round out top 3
Home heating accounted for another 19.6% of state emissions — the second largest source, though it dropped slightly from the previous year thanks to a milder winter and improvements in energy efficiency and weatherization. It was not clear how a 2022 state rebate program helping residential and commercial building owners offset costs to convert to heat pumps affected total building heating emissions, according to the report.
Electricity consumption, the third-highest emissions factor, remained flat year-over-year, according to the report. Nearly a quarter of electricity use came from renewable sources, but the electricity supplied by regional grid operator ISO New England was more carbon-intense than in previous years, the report noted. State electricity-related emissions are expected to decline significantly starting next year, when the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project begins supplying power to Rhode Island and Connecticut. 
The inventory also considers emissions from industrial product uses, agriculture and waste, while accounting for trees and natural lands that absorb some of the greenhouse gases released.

(Nathan Granger/LINK nky)Northern Kentucky University is set to implement a new policy starting Jan. 1 that will require administrators, staff, student-employees and other non-faculty employees to be on campus five days a week. 
This will effectively curb remote work across much of the university. The change will not affect faculty and advisors.
The move comes after the most recent meeting of NKU’s Board of Regents, which approved several other labor policies, most notably a policy allowing tenured and tenure-track faculty members to voluntarily leave the university in exchange for a buyout. Tenured administrators could also take a buyout.
As it relates to remote work, employees can apply to their supervisors for two so-called “flexible work” days a week, where they don’t need to be on-site, by Dec. 1. 
Exceptions are subject to annual reviews, and employees must meet certain criteria in order to be eligible. Requests will be made to the employee’s immediate supervisor and must also receive approval from their office head or dean, the relevant vice president, and the university’s human resources department.
“We see this policy as a sound compromise,” said NKU President Cady Short-Thompson as the NKU Board of Regents meeting Wednesday morning, “one that offers flexibility and meets institutional needs.”
Short-Thompson said the policy change came following a long period of feedback and shared governance processes. 
The stories all of NKY will be talking about, delivered to your inbox each weekday morning.
The document eliciting the policy, which you can read here, lays out the processes and stipulations around off-site work. Employees cannot apply for off-site work permissions during the first 90 days after they’ve been hired. 
Moreover, they must have earned either an “exceptional,” “highly successful” or “successful” rating on their most recent performance evaluation. Anyone undergoing disciplinary action is ineligible.
Employees would not be able to appeal a denial. Moreover, those employees who are approved “may not engage in childcare, eldercare or similar family responsibilities during times when they are supposed to be working,” according to the policy. “Employees must identify appropriate care regardless of where they are working.” 
Regent Cori Henderson asked about employees who had been hired on specially as remote workers. 
“I think that there is a part of the policy, as I think you know, that allows for exceptions, and it is up to the supervisor as to whether or not that exception will be granted,” Short-Thompson said. “I think we also recognize that in a handful of cases, we can’t find the talent or the skill sets that we need in this immediate region.”
The meeting also saw the approval of two other policies, a revision of its non-discrimination polices and the new work separation agreement, both of which were passed as part of the meeting’s consent agenda. 
The non-discrimination policy revisions include changes to the university’s process of investigating discrimination and harassment complaints and add explicit protections against antisemitism. The regents did not discuss this policy.
The buy out policy, however, which allows eligible faculty to leave in exchange for “a lump sum, one-time payment of 80% of their base salary (full or part-time salary), not to exceed $100,000, and an additional lump sum of $10,000, in recognition of health care costs,” according to university documents, did elicit some comments from the Board’s faculty regent, Sandra Spataro. 
While Spataro said she was in favor of the policy, given the university’s financial troubles, she worried about the effect it might have on the workload of the teaching staff and the overall dynamic between the teaching and non-teaching workers at the university.
“There’s going to be an increase in workload on those who do not participate in this program, and that’s just adding stress to our workforce that is already quite stressed…,” Spataro said, later adding, “We got to be aware that we are sowing further divide in the employee community.”
Spataro eventually voted for the policy, despite his trepidation.
“Reducing tenured faculty could be incorrectly interpreted as NKU compromising or lessening our priority on academic excellence,” Spataro also said before the vote was cast. “That’s absolutely not the case, and we’ll want to make absolutely sure that we do everything we can to communicate that continued commitment with great clarity because people can perceive things in very different ways.”

(Getty Images)If Kentucky relied on its food banks alone, our feeding ecosystem would collapse in a week. That’s not hyperbole, it’s simple math. Even the strongest food distribution network in the state can cover only a fraction of what the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides every month.
We talk a lot about the generosity of Kentuckians, especially in times of crisis. However, we need to start talking about scale. Feeding Kentucky’s seven food banks make up the commonwealth’s largest charitable response to hunger. And the truth is simple: Our food banks were built to support, not replace, a federal nutrition program that provides nine times more meals.
Every day, our distribution sites move mountains of food, millions of pounds each month, to keep families from going without. That work is powered by donors, volunteers and partners who step up when a crisis hits.
The 43-day federal shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, was an unplanned stress test of our hunger infrastructure, and the lesson was clear: When SNAP goes unfunded, families face hardship immediately and the strain on food banks becomes unsustainable.
This summer, Congress passed House Resolution 1, which includes long-term changes to SNAP’s funding model and adjusts how states share administrative costs.
Kentucky’s specific cost share will be announced in the coming weeks, giving the General Assembly the chance to plan in the next budget session. With thoughtful preparation, the state can ensure continued support for the 645,000 Kentuckians who rely on SNAP, helping stabilize families and strengthen our workforce.
According to Map the Meal Gap, more than 750,000 Kentuckians experience food insecurity, 1 in 5 children and 1 in 8 seniors among them. These are not numbers. They are employees, students, parents, caregivers and retirees.
And this is where the conversation must get honest: SNAP is not just a nutrition program. It is also an economic and workforce engine.
More than 95% of people who use SNAP are working, retired or disabled. SNAP keeps families stable so adults can stay in the workforce. It helps seniors raising grandchildren keep food on the table. It helps small businesses retain reliable employees by reducing turnover. It supports Kentuckians who can no longer meet the physical demands of work. And it ensures students are fed, improving attendance, behavior and long-term workforce readiness. We cannot build tomorrow’s workforce on empty stomachs.
These economic truths underscore the central point, that charity cannot replace the scale or the stabilizing power of SNAP.
Feeding Kentucky’s network provided about 63 million meals last year. That’s a remarkable achievement. But SNAP provides nearly $100 million in benefits in October alone, more than six times the combined monthly operating budgets of all seven food banks in the state.
Charitable food assistance plays a critical role in filling short-term gaps, but it was never designed to offset sweeping federal cuts. No donation drive, no holiday campaign, no emergency fund can replace the infrastructure or economic lift of SNAP.
Last month, the legislature and governor’s office worked together to secure funding for the senior meals program, a bipartisan decision that protected vulnerable Kentuckians. We need that same commitment as SNAP’s state cost shift comes into view.

We need a strong, stable nutrition program that keeps folks employed, keeps kids learning and keeps bellies full.
SNAP does all of that, every single day.
Now, it’s time to protect it.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1153457088-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 05:58:57.597825

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)The regional power transmission network and electricity market manager that serves Pennsylvania and 12 other states faces a mid-December deadline for a plan to manage the impact of data centers and other large energy consumers on electricity prices and reliability.
PJM Interconnection’s members committee, consisting of about 800 local utilities, generators and other energy industry interests, voted on proposals for new rules for data centers and how the cost of building new generating and transmission capacity will be shared among consumers.
The outcome of the Critical Issue Fast Path process, in which PJM has prioritized the rulemaking, will have long term effects on the affordability and reliability of electricity supplies across the network, which spans from New Jersey to Illinois and Pennsylvania’s northern border to North Carolina.
“We’re trying to ensure that there’s enough supply, that the lights are going to stay on and there are no additional rate increases,” said Jon Gordon, director of Advanced Energy United, a group that represents the sustainable energy industry. “Nobody wants, from a policy standpoint, to shut the doors on data center development.”
The path PJM will take, however, remains unclear following the 7-hour meeting last Wednesday where stakeholder groups presented the proposals. Although the votes are only advisory for PJM’s board of managers, which will make the final decision, none reached the two-thirds majority threshold to be approved.

“PJM opened this conversation about the integration of large loads and greatly appreciates our stakeholders for their contributions to this effort,” a PJM spokesperson said. “The stakeholder process produced many thoughtful proposals, some of which were introduced late in the process and require additional development.”
The board of managers expects to act on the proposals in the next few weeks, the spokesperson said.
The nine-member board must choose a proposal or a combination of proposals and submit the final plan to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month. The deadline, Gordon said, is driven by a desire to have the changes in place before next summer’s capacity auction, which establishes the price generators will receive to have plants ready to meet the grid’s peak demands. 
PJM’s work to ensure grid and price stability in the face of growing demand comes as Pennsylvania lawmakers restated their energy policy goals for the coming year. 
As part of the agreement to settle the commonwealth’s monthslong  budget impasse, Democrats agreed to withdraw from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which former Gov. Tom Wolf joined by executive order in 2019. Republicans said the agreement would “unleash the promise of Pennsylvania” through the development of its natural gas resources. 
RGGI would have required carbon dioxide emitters to purchase credits designed to encourage the use of renewable energy sources. Republicans said it amounted to a tax on electricity and a drag on the state’s economy.
“We had neither certainty or stability, and I truly believe that because of our regulatory climate here in Pennsylvania, we were continuing to lose energy development and the family sustaining jobs that go with it to our neighboring states,” House Republican Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said Tuesday. 
Democratic lawmakers called on colleagues in the General Assembly to support legislation to protect consumers by establishing permanent funding for energy assistance programs and enacting legislation to require accurate energy use forecasting, encourage renewable energy development and protect ratepayers from data center costs.

“Pennsylvania needs good jobs. We need economic activity, and we support technological innovation, but we are all here today because at the heart of it are our constituents, working people who simply want to be able to keep the heat on and not worry every month what’s coming next,” House Energy Committee Chairperson Elizabeth Fiedler (D-Philadelphia) said in a news conference last Wednesday.
Corey Young, the director of Washington & Jefferson College’s energy policy center, said Pennsylvania should be free to benefit from data center development and the economic activity it brings. But he added the commonwealth has served as an energy exporter while neighboring states like Maryland and New Jersey have retired older polluting power plants.
He said any plan to deal with the impacts of data center growth should also include provisions for distributed generation, such as rooftop solar or community solar. But Pennsylvania has been slow to pass legislation that allows it. The state also faces opposition to existing provisions that make it more attractive, such as net metering that allows solar panel owners to sell excess energy back to the electricity grid.
Data center development across PJM’s territory has contributed to rising energy costs and peak demand that is forecast to grow by 20% over the next decade, according to PJM’s forecast.
In the last two PJM auctions, the capacity price has set records despite an agreement between PJM and the Shapiro administration to cap prices. As a result of the record-high price of $269.92 per megawatt-day established for 2025, consumers saw electric bills increase sharply this summer. The price for 2026 could bring additional increases for ratepayers between 1.5% and 5%, according to PJM. 
The coming auction in July will set the capacity price for 2027 and could bring another steep hike without the rules for large load additions, Gordon said.
“For PJM to get the generation in place to serve these massive loads and the transmission in place, there’s a massive cost associated with that,” he said.
Data centers, which provide the computing power to run websites and streaming services in addition to artificial intelligence products, can consume as much electricity as small cities. One planned by Amazon Web Services for a site adjacent to Talen Energy’s Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear power plant in Luzerne County would use as much energy as 900,000 homes, according to Amazon.
Constellation Energy and Microsoft announced a power purchase agreement in which the software company will buy the entire 835 megawatt output of the former Three Mile Island nuclear plant when its remaining reactor is restored to service in 2027.
But other data center projects have been proposed without clear sources of electricity or agreements on how the cost of building new transmission lines will be shared. PJM’s independent market monitor has asked FERC to reject an agreement between Amazon and Philadelphia region electric utility PECO until the companies can show it won’t increase costs for retail electricity customers.

The proposals considered last week include PJM’s own plan to employ a model in which large load users commit to reducing their consumption based on real-time energy prices and consumption. The top vote getter was a modified version of PJM’s plan proposed by the Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative that included changes to the price at which large users would reduce energy consumption, penalties for failing to reduce demand and clarification on who has supervisory control over the order to cut power consumption.
Also considered was a proposal by the Data Center Coalition, which includes Amazon, Google, Microsoft and other data center operators, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and the governors of Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. This plan would allow large users to plan their own generating capacity with expedited connections to the grid, expedited siting and permitting and priority connections for new power generation.
Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent market monitor, proposed rules that would not allow large-load additions until generating and transmission capacity is available and an expedited connection process for new generation. The rules would encourage data centers to build their own generation in order to get online faster, the proposal said, adding that it would also insulate retail consumers from costs associated with the projects. 
“If the data centers do bring their own generation but the data centers do not materialize, the system is better off and there is no harm from the incorrect forecast,” it said. “The ‘bring your own new generation’ option requires a financial and physical commitment to the reliability of the grid that eliminates the current concerns about the forecasting process.”
Gordon said the independent market monitor proposal “makes it impossible for consumers to be on the hook for data center proposals.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_8691-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 05:58:57.597825

(Photo by Chris Bergin for KFF Health News)Eliza Brader worries she soon will need to prove she’s working to continue receiving Medicaid health coverage. She doesn’t think she should have to.
The 27-year-old resident of Bloomington, Indiana, has a pacemaker and a painful joint disease. She also has fused vertebrae in her neck from a spinal injury, preventing her from turning her head.
 
People on Medicaid deemed “medically frail” won’t need to meet new federal requirements that enrollees work 80 hours a month or perform another approved activity. But state officials are grappling with how to interpret who qualifies under the vague federal definition, which could affect millions.


Indiana’s Medicaid agency currently considers Brader “medically frail,” giving her access to an expanded set of benefits, such as physical therapy.
New federal rules will require more than 18 million Medicaid enrollees nationwide to show they’re working, volunteering, or going to school for 80 hours a month starting in 2027 to keep their coverage. Brader is exempt as long as she’s deemed medically frail.
But lacking sufficient federal guidance, states are wrestling with how to define medical frailty — a consequential decision that could cut Medicaid coverage for many people, said state officials, consumer advocates, and health policy researchers.
“It’s terrifying,” Brader said. “I already have fought so hard to get my health care.”
‘Incredibly high’ stakes
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act slashes nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade, with much of the savings projected to come from no longer covering those who don’t qualify under the new work rules. Those spending cuts help offset the costs of GOP priorities, such as extra border security and tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy.
Conservative lawmakers have argued that Medicaid, the government health insurance program for people with low incomes or with disabilities, has grown too large and expensive, especially in the wake of its expansion to more low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act. They also say that requiring participants to work is common sense.
The work rules in Trump’s tax-and-spending law offer exemptions for several groups who might struggle to meet them, including people deemed “medically frail.” The law spells out certain “medically frail” conditions such as blindness, disability, and substance use disorder. But it does not list many others.
Instead, the law exempts those with a “serious or complex medical condition,” a term whose interpretation could vary by state. 
State officials say they need more clarity to ensure that people who cannot work for health reasons retain rightful access to Medicaid. They also worry that, even with a clear definition, people will face the onerous task of having to regularly vouch for being medically frail, which is a challenge without reliable access to medical care.
“The stakes are incredibly high,” said Kinda Serafi, a partner at consulting firm Manatt Health.

The new work requirements will affect Medicaid recipients in 42 states and Washington, D.C. Eight states — Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming — did not expand their Medicaid programs to cover additional low-income adults, so they won’t have to implement the work rules.
The Medicaid work rules are expected to be the largest driver of health insurance coverage losses over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Forty-four percent of all adults covered by states’ expanded Medicaid programs have at least one chronic health condition, according to KFF.
A challenge for states
State Medicaid agencies are scrambling to implement the rules with little direction from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has yet to issue specific guidance. Federal officials will clarify the “medically frail” definition next year, said Andrew Nixon, an agency spokesperson.
Ultimately, states will have to decide who is unhealthy enough to be exempt from work rules. And it won’t be easy for state workers and their computer systems to track.
Every year, state eligibility systems screen millions of applicants to check if they qualify for Medicaid and other government programs. Now, these same systems must screen applicants and existing enrollees to determine whether they meet the new work rules. 
Jessica Kahn, a partner at consulting firm McKinsey & Co., has urged states to start planning how to adapt eligibility systems to verify work status. States can do a “tremendous amount” of work without direction from the federal government, said Kahn, a former federal Medicaid systems official, who spoke during a recent Medicaid advisory panel hearing. “Time is a-wasting already.”
State Medicaid directors are pondering the challenge.
“Medical frailty gets so complex,” Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director, said during a recent panel discussion. Conditions that can keep people from working, such as mental health disorders, can be hard to prove, she said.
A state might try to use a person’s health records, for instance, to determine medical frailty. But a patient’s chart may not paint a clear picture of someone’s health, especially if they lack regular access to medical care.
It’s a tall order for eligibility systems that historically have not had to scrape medical records to screen applicants, said Serafi of Manatt Health.
“That is an incredibly new thing that eligibility enrollment systems are just not fluent in at all,” Serafi said.
Lobbying groups for the private health insurance companies that help run Medicaid in many states also have urged federal regulators to clearly define medical frailty so it can be applied uniformly.
In a Nov. 3 letter to federal officials, the Medicaid Health Plans of America and the Association for Community Affiliated Plans advocated for allowing enrollees to qualify for the exemption by saying on their applications that they have conditions that make them medically frail. Successfully implementing exemptions for the medically frail will be “crucial” given the “severe health risks of coverage loss for these populations,” the groups said.
Some state officials worry about unintended consequences of the work rules for people with chronic conditions.
Jennifer Strohecker, who recently resigned as Utah’s Medicaid director, reiterated the high stakes, especially for those with diabetes on Medicaid. They may be very healthy and functional with insulin, but if they fail to complete the work requirements, that may change, Strohecker said during a recent Medicaid advisory hearing. 
Whether someone is deemed medically frail already depends heavily on where they live.
For example, in Arkansas, people indicate on their Medicaid applications that they’re disabled, blind, or need help with daily living activities.
Approximately 6% of the roughly 221,000 people enrolled in Arkansas’ Medicaid expansion program are deemed medically frail, according to Gavin Lesnick, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Human Services.
In West Virginia, the state accepts a medical frailty designation when an applicant self-reports it.
The burden of proof is higher in North Dakota. Applicants there must answer a questionnaire about their health and submit additional documentation, which may include medical chart notes and treatment plans. More than half of applicants were denied last year, according to Health and Human Services Department spokesperson Mindy Michaels.
Indiana’s Family and Social Services Administration, which runs its Medicaid program, declined an interview and said it could not comment on individual cases, like Brader’s.
Brader worries the additional red tape will cause her to lose Medicaid again. She said she was temporarily kicked off the program in 2019 for failing to meet the state’s work rules when Indiana said her work-study job didn’t count as employment.
“Anytime I have tried to receive help from the state of Indiana, it has been a bureaucratic nightmare,” she said.

As states await federal guidance, Kristi Putnam, a senior fellow at the conservative Cicero Institute and former secretary of the Arkansas Department of Human Services, which oversees the state Medicaid program, said even if a state creates an extensive list of qualifying “medically frail” conditions, the line must be drawn somewhere.
“You can’t possibly create a policy for exemptions that will catch everything,” she said.

(Photo by William Woody/Colorado Newsline)National public lands belong to everyone — which, in Colorado, means they’re used both for energy development and for people in neon puffy jackets yelling, “Send it.” These lands fuel our economy, powering everything from oil rigs to REI dividend checks that some families depend on more than Social Security. Responsible management matters because it protects Colorado’s economy, families, and the mountains future generations will need for their hiking selfies.
But here’s the problem: The Department of the Interior has announced plans to roll back critical bonding requirements for companies drilling on public lands. And when you hear “bonding,” don’t picture CEOs blindfolded, falling backward into each other’s arms. Not that kind. This bonding is the money companies set aside so when wells turn into rusty straws sticking out of the ground, taxpayers aren’t left footing the cleanup bill.
This isn’t hypothetical. Taxpayers have already paid billions to cap and clean up abandoned wells — money that could have gone to schools, roads or at least a state-funded program to teach tourists not to feed Pop-Tarts to moose.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Strong bonding requirements are the security deposit for oil companies — insurance that someone cleans up after the well. Without those funds, the wells don’t just become “abandoned” — they become “orphaned.”
It’s a growing problem. A report from Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship found taxpayers could owe up to $15 billion to clean thousands of abandoned wells across the West. Here in Colorado, more than 240 wells have sat idle for over four years. And when no responsible party steps up, guess who plays foster parent? Yep — the taxpayers.
That burden is about to grow as the Trump administration pushes for more drilling on public lands. More than 11.5 million acres in Colorado are now open to drilling with the passage of H.R. 1, the recent tax cut and spending bill, including areas near Great Sand Dunes, Mesa Verde and Dinosaur National Monument.
In fact, a new Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship analysis reveals that the industry could drill as many as 3.8 million new wells on our public lands in the coming years. The cost to clean up those wells? Up to $753.5 billion — a bill that would, in part, fall on taxpayers and local communities if bonding requirements are rolled back.
How is that fair? It shouldn’t be controversial that taxpayers shouldn’t get stuck with the bill — unless you’re the kind of person who thinks “dine and dash” should be a business model.
Colorado taxpayers should be able to hike and camp on public lands without tripping over oil wells companies abandoned like a New Year’s resolution by mid-January. It’s not radical — it’s common sense. Over 90% of Coloradans agree: oil and gas companies, not taxpayers, should clean up their messes.
By rolling back bonding requirements — the oil industry’s security deposit — Interior isn’t just gambling with our health, it’s handing taxpayers the mop and bucket for a mess we didn’t make.
Enough is enough. Federal leaders need to prioritize the health of our lands and people over industry handouts. Colorado’s businesses, ecosystems and communities depend on it, and taxpayers shouldn’t be left cleaning up oil wells when we’ve already got our hands full with tourists in neon jackets yelling “Send it!” while feeding Pop-Tarts to moose.

(Photo by Getty Images)The end of the nation’s longest ever government shutdown brought a sigh of relief for Kentuckians who depend on federal food assistance. After weeks of unnecessary delays and intentional confusion, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits arrived just in time to prevent an empty table this Thanksgiving. But for many, the relief will be short lived. Now that the acute stress of the shutdown-induced crisis is over, a large group of Kentucky’s SNAP participants face an emerging chronic pain — new red tape requirements that could strip 114,000 Kentuckians of food aid.
SNAP plays a crucial role in ensuring that 560,000 Kentuckians have enough to eat, providing an average of $6 per day for groceries. It’s also important to the economy and rural grocers in particular, who may have to shut their doors as their customers are continually forced out of SNAP.
The most urgent looming cuts are due to last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which took a sledgehammer to the nation’s most important anti-hunger program under the theory that stripping enough hungry Americans of food assistance can offset the cost of one billionaire’s tax cuts. Additional threats include a recent proposal to gut broad-based categorical eligibility, a longstanding policy that allows tens of thousands of Kentuckians — primarily kids and seniors — to earn slightly more or save for emergencies without immediately being cut off SNAP.
Under the OBBBA, ineffective work reporting requirements will be expanded to include a host of previously exempted groups, including:

Caregivers with children over 13. Previously, having any child in the household exempted parents from the work reporting requirement. 
Older adults between 55 and 64, an age group that is particularly vulnerable to food insecurity in Kentucky. Previously, only adults up to 54 were subject to the work reporting requirement. 
Veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster youth. Previously, these groups were exempt in recognition of the unique difficulties they face when it comes to routine work reporting.
Residents of areas with high unemployment. Previously, people living in certain areas meeting signs of economic distress were exempt because of the challenge of finding work where they live.

These rules are based on tired and often racist stereotypes that scapegoat SNAP participants. But the reality is that most people receiving SNAP are children, seniors or people with a disability. Many of the rest already work, but their wages are so low and their hours so inconsistent that they still qualify for SNAP. 
These work reporting requirements aren’t really about getting people jobs though and a large body of research shows they don’t accomplish that. Instead, they trip people up in paperwork so they’re eventually kicked off SNAP. Taking away food assistance makes life more difficult and penalizes people who are struggling rather than helping them find stable work. That is especially true as the cost-of-living soars, forcing families to choose between paying rent and buying groceries as debt and bills pile up.
Rather than restricting SNAP, policymakers should recognize the vital role it serves in the lives of working people and their families. This Thanksgiving, I hope they reflect on the stories of gratitude for SNAP they heard during the shutdown. And when they sit down to their own feast, I hope they ask themselves whether they’re making it easier or harder for others to do the same.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snap-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 05:58:57.597825

The chair of the 5th Congressional District GOP Committee had arrived at the Donald W. Huffman Advance — the Republican Party of Virginia’s annual flagship gathering — at The Forum Hotel in Charlottesville on Dec. 6, 2024, hoping the event would offer a clear roadmap heading into a pivotal election year. 
Instead, he said, he witnessed what felt like an early coronation of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who had launched her gubernatorial bid that September and, in his view, had already been handpicked by Gov. Glenn Youngkin as his successor.
“I sat there and watched it,” Buchanan said. “I had breakfast, and then went to the first real gathering of the troops, at lunch, and that’s when the coronation began. And I packed my stuff up and left, I didn’t want to hear any more.”
The program, he said, offered little for local organizers seeking help to compete in difficult districts. “There was nothing for us grassroots supporters,” he said. “You know what the program was about? Furthering Youngkin’s agenda.”
One year later, after Democrats swept all three statewide offices in November 2025 and picked up more than a dozen seats to solidify a 67-seat House of Delegates majority, Buchanan’s concerns have become the center of a widening debate inside a party struggling to process the magnitude of its losses — and to figure out what comes next.
 A statewide collapse that mirrored a national trend

The scale of the GOP’s collapse stunned both parties.
Democrats sweep Virginia’s statewide races, reclaiming full control of executive branch

Democrat Abigail Spanberger defeated Winsome Earle-Sears by a commanding 15-point margin in the governor’s race, while Democrats flipped more House seats than most analysts predicted — a sweeping repudiation of Republican candidates and messaging. 
Attorney General Jason Miyares, the Republican incumbent, fell short in his bid for a second term, losing to Democrat Jay Jones despite efforts to make his campaign about the law and order contrast and highlighting Jones’ resurfacing text-message scandal. 
Veteran political analyst Bob Holsworth said the results were part of a national pattern. 
“First and foremost, this election was a national wave,” he said, pointing to Democratic gains in New Jersey, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Georgia. But Virginia’s situation, he said, reflected deeper structural problems for Republicans.
“You had Abigail Spandberger, a seasoned candidate who ran an extraordinarily disciplined campaign,” Holsworth said. In contrast, he argued Earle-Sears “spent most of the campaign as a culture warrior… and she just wasn’t where people are.”
Federal budget cuts and the prolonged government shutdown also played a role, he added. “We were ground zero in Virginia,” Holsworth said. “You saw an increased level of not only Democratic votes, but turnout in general in Northern Virginia.”
Holsworth also credited House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, with orchestrating one of the most effective legislative campaign operations he has seen in recent Virginia politics. 
“He raised enormous sums of money, targeted 13 races and pitched the perfect game,” he said.
 Tensions grow over Youngkin’s influence

Inside GOP circles, much of the lingering anger is aimed at Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
Buchanan and other activists say Youngkin’s early public support for Earle-Sears discouraged other potential candidates — particularly Miyares — from entering the primary for the top spot of the Republican ticket.
Holsworth said that criticism is “well placed.” Miyares, he argued, “would have been a far stronger candidate,” with more experience and a broader ability to compete in suburban regions where Democrats dominated.
Youngkin’s decision to urge Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid to withdraw from the race — after controversy over an old social media post — further inflamed the perception that top leaders were shaping the ticket rather than allowing a competitive, open primary process. 
“Youngkin did that,” Holsworth said, adding that the move made it “impossible” for Reid to fundraise or establish a statewide operation.
 Peake pushes back: “We don’t coronate someone”

Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake flatly rejects the idea that Youngkin or party leadership pushed challengers aside.
“We don’t have the authority or the ability to just coronate someone,” Peake told The Mercury in a phone interview last week.
Peake also noted the timing: he took office in April 2025, just weeks b

efore filing deadlines. “Primaries were open to anyone,” he said. “Nobody can make you not run.” 
Peake said candidates who jumped in late simply failed to gather enough signatures to qualify. 
“If you’ve got to have somebody else give you approval to run, then you’re not a leader,” he said.
He added that the party spent months strengthening turnout infrastructure: “All RPV has done is reach out to grassroots, reach out to voters, and go after the Trump supporting voters. That is what RPV is.”
But many activists say the party’s efforts lacked message discipline and statewide unity — a contrast to Democratic campaigns that emphasized abortion rights, cost-of-living issues and government stability. 
 Grassroots anger erupts into open revolt

Possibly no Republican voice has been louder in the weeks since the election than Loudoun County GOP Chair Scott Pio. 
In a lengthy post on X, formerly Twitter, Pio accused state party leadership of failing to build a coherent statewide message and of instructing unit chairs not to engage in issue-based communication.
“So while the Democrats have a messaging machine … the Republican Party personally mandates that they are not allowed to talk policy,” Pio wrote.
He then demanded the resignation of Peake, in addition to the GOP State Central Committee’s executive leadership and any member who “has taken a check from a candidate in the last five years.”
Peake pushed back against Pio’s move. 
“The best step would be for Pio to resign,” he said in the interview, calling him “part of the problem” and saying he “has not gotten over that crushing defeat I delivered to him” in the RPV chair election in the spring.
Pio, in an interview with The Mercury, rejected that characterization. 
“Why didn’t (Peake) find all the House of Delegate candidates?” he asked. “It’s unforgivable that he’s just blaming other people.”
He also said the party is failing to reach fast-growing voting blocs — particularly Latino, Muslim, Arab, Indian and younger voters — and warned the GOP will continue to lose unless it modernizes. 
“There needs to be a fundamental rewriting of the Republican Party in Virginia,” Pio said. “If they don’t get their act together, it’s over.”
 Leadership tensions spill into the House of Delegates

The Republican post-election reckoning is also affecting the General Assembly. 
Del. Mike Cherry, R-Colonial Heights, challenged Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, for his leadership position in a recent closed caucus meeting but was unsuccessful. Cherry declined to comment for this story. 
Kilgore did not respond to messages but said in a statement after the vote that Republicans would “rebuild, reconnect, and deliver a message that resonates with voters across Virginia.”
Democrats, meanwhile, are already moving to consolidate their gains. Just days before the election, they advanced a constitutional amendment that could allow the General Assembly to redraw Virginia’s U.S. House districts ahead of the 2026 elections — sidestepping the independent redistricting commission voters approved in 2020.
The move immediately alarmed Republicans, who warned that a mid-decade map rewrite would deepen the party’s struggles with candidate recruitment, messaging and suburban competitiveness at the very moment they are trying to regroup. 
In the days since their sweeping victory, Virginia Democrats have wasted no time launching a progressive agenda. 
They unveiled a fresh slate of bills last week that include raising the state minimum wage to $15 by 2028, mandating paid sick leave statewide, enshrining access to birth control, creating a task force to remove barriers to energy-efficient upgrades for low-income households and giving localities first right of refusal on affordable-housing sales.
Among these is a bill from Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, to fully repeal Virginia’s right-to-work law — a move that could stir intraparty tensions as moderate Democrats and business-friendly factions raise alarms. 
Despite these challenges, Peake believes the party can recover from its devastating election losses. He predicts Democratic proposals on gun regulation, labor law and social policy will spark voter backlash. 
“Republicans in Virginia are never done,” he said. “We will always fight.”
He also rejected the idea that Virginia is now reliably Democratic. “I disagree with that assessment completely,” Peake said. “It’s just a matter of organizing and getting our message out there.”
Holsworth, the political analyst, was more guarded. 
“They need a party that can compete in the suburbs,” he said, noting that Virginia’s population centers — Northern Virginia, Henrico and Chesterfield, and parts of Hampton Roads — now strongly favor Democrats. Still, he said Republicans could regain competitiveness with strategic recalibration.
“Things can change,” he said. “But they need a rethinking that’s along the lines of Virginia demographics.”
For Buchanan, who left last year’s Republican Advance convinced the party had lost touch with its voters, the message is simple and unvarnished. 
“Once we select personality over policy, we’re toast,” he said.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)A flush of a toilet, the rinse of a washing machine, or the discharge from factories – it all ends up as wastewater. That waste is then treated and made into a sludge called biosolids. Biosolids can be converted to agricultural fertilizer and by using it, many farmers in Virginia may be unknowingly spreading toxic chemicals on their land that could end up in crops and the state’s waterways.
As state Sen. Richard Stuart, R-King George, said in a recent State Water Commission hearing, “we don’t want it to go in the river anymore, for goodness’ sake.” 
Biosolids can contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which pose serious health risks if people are exposed to them in higher amounts. The danger has led some states to outright ban, or enact stricter requirements in the use of biosolids, and prompted calls from some Virginia communities to do the same.
PFAS are everywhere; Virginia doesn’t test for them in biosolids
Forever chemicals are in hundreds of products we use every day, from nonstick cookware to takeout food packaging and even dental floss. They take hundreds of years to break down and can be a serious challenge to remove from the environment. The use of these chemicals started around the 1940s and has only expanded with time. 
Being exposed over long durations and frequent occurrences to PFAS increases the risk of the chemicals interfering with the body’s natural hormones, possibly increasing cholesterol levels, lowering women’ s chances of getting pregnant, affecting the immune system, or boosting the risk of certain cancers.
The hangup for many community members and lawmakers is that Virginia does not test biosolids to see if there are high concentrations of PFAS in them. 
The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality does sample rivers and creeks across the commonwealth to look for the presence of PFAS, however, that data dashboard was disabled on the agency’s website during the course of writing this story. 
DEQ is not required to test biosolids for the presence of PFAS under current law. A map provided by the agency shows that biosolid permits have been granted in almost all corners of the commonwealth, but the map has not been updated in five years.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency put out a draft assessment on the risk two chemicals in the PFAS family pose on farmers with amounts as small as one part per billion. However, the report did not call for the regulation of those chemicals when they are found in biosolids.
Maine became the first state to ban the use of biosolids after multiple farms were shut down after extreme levels of PFAS were detected in soil, livestock, and even farmers’ blood where biosolids had been spread nearby. Well water at these farms had also been poisoned by the chemicals. The state has set up a fund to aid farmers who may have had to halt their production due to the presence of PFAS.
Michigan prohibits the use of highly contaminated biosolids from being used, but still lets some be spread on the very small amount of land that still uses biosolids. Meanwhile, Virginia only regulates setbacks from wells and homes during the spreading of the sludge as well as nutrient management plans for the fields.
Researchers, communities press for PFAS protection
At Virginia Tech, Shilai Hao researches analysis of PFAS in the environment and is looking for ways to permanently remove it. He said that people are commonly exposed to forever chemicals by way of the products they use. Hao said it is critical for the state government to be testing biosolids due to the concentration of those chemicals in one source.
“Testing helps agricultural producers understand whether biosolids-derived products are safe to apply on their farms. It also helps wastewater treatment plants decide how biosolids should be managed or disposed of to reduce PFAS-related risks,” Hao said.
One of the companies that provides biosolids in Virginia is Synagro. It is in the process of getting permits reissued in multiple counties. A spokesperson for the company said “Synagro is a passive receiver of PFAS from municipalities, who themselves are passive receivers from their customers.”
The spokesperson went on to say that Synagro supports potential legislation to remove PFAS at the source or to implement discharge limitations for manufacturers to stop it from ending up in wastewater. 
The Shenandoah Valley has a concentration of biosolid permits issued near Charlottesville, according to the 2020 map. At the University of Virginia, Bryan Berger is researching how PFAS end up in soil and food. He said that despite PFAS being basically ubiquitous, biosolids still pose a higher risk.
“There’s a direct correlation between PFAS application and PFAS levels in drinking water and blood serum. At minimum, you’d want to test because you don’t want to have that,” Berger said. “Why do that to yourself, expose yourself to that risk?”
The concern over biosolids is not new in Virginia. Stuart Overbey lives in Albemarle County, where she is trying to raise awareness for years about the farms in her area that have permits to spread biosolids. She said in the summer of 2024, when spreading was happening near her house, the substance was all over the roads.
“You had to roll up your windows, turn off your AC. It’s not like cow manure smell or even chicken manure. It’s like death. It’s like your body reacts,” Overbey said.
She has been collecting stories of people across Virginia who say their health and well water quality declined after neighbors used biosolids. She’s joined forces with groups like the Piedmont Environmental Council and community advocates in Orange and Albemarle counties to request public hearings for the permit requests and renewals for the biosolid companies.
In Virginia, counties can pass ordinances requiring the testing and monitoring of biosolids. Overbey has written a draft for her county but it has not been taken up by the Board of Supervisors yet.
The permits in each county last for 10 years and additional land can be added between each permit. In Orange County, Synagro is currently going through the process to add 200 acres to their permit and remove 1178 acres for a total of 2564 acres permitted for the sludge. 
Orange County resident Jamie McConnell read about PFAS in biosolids and what other states have done to curb the risk. When he first learned about it he didn’t know how to try and stop it from being used in his community. Now he’s pressing the state to take action.
“They didn’t know the extent to which it’s contaminated. It’s an outrage at the DEQ that they won’t test. It’s silly,” McConnell said.
At an October meeting, dozens of community members showed up to a hearing about the reissuance of the Orange permit. Some of the land in the permit is near Pamunkey Creek.
The chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, R. Mark Johnson, wrote to DEQ to alert the agency that PFAS has already been detected in the creek. Johnson wrote that the board is not against the use of biosolids for fertilizer, but they want to ensure farmers are aware of potential contaminants.
“Our farmers deserve to know what they’re putting on their land, and our citizens deserve protection from forever chemicals,” Johnson said in his letter.
Alternatives to biosolids

With biosolids being a cheaper option for farmers who need to use fertilizers on their land, many are asking what can be done to reduce the need for it.
On a windy November afternoon outside of Charlottesville, Massey Teel coils up a wire on his land to let cows, sheep, goats and donkeys shift over to a new small quadrant of land, part of the process of regenerative farming. 
Every day he moves his livestock to a new roped off area of his land to feed and drop their own waste. He doesn’t put them back in the same area for months to allow for the natural fertilizers to work into the land and the grasses to grow back.
The land he works on had been leased to a previous farmer who had used biosolids in the past. Teel said he understands something has to be done with the waste – but there needs to be more done to help the environment and preserve farmland.
Teel said often, crops are grown and cattle are raised in ways that don’t allow the land to naturally regenerate nutrients, leading farmers to need the fertilizer. 
“It’s not just that those biosolids are being put down there or any other fertilizers being put down there, but because they have poor ground cover and every time it rains, a huge amount of that fertilizer is going to flow downstream,” Teel said. “ And it has all sorts of negative effects for our watersheds all the way down to the bay.”
There are ways to reduce that need, protect the land from runoff and save farmers money, Teel said, including more oversight from state authorities.
“As far as I’m concerned, a little more regulation is not a bad thing,” Teel added.
In Richmond, lawmakers are debating how to protect their constituents who increasingly reach out to them with their worries about the chemicals in biosolids. 
Stuart, the state senator representing King George, said Maryland recently set limitations to how many parts per billion of PFAS found in the sludge can be allowed in order to spread the substance on agricultural land. That often leads to Maryland’s biosolids being shipped over to Virginia, which does not have such limits.
He said he plans to bring legislation in the 2026 General Assembly to set limits and require testing. He would prefer to have a zero tolerance, he said in an interview, but understands that may not be fair to industry.
“I think it’s important that you go, we at least meet or go below Maryland’s threshold, because if we don’t, they’re going to keep sending it across the river with us,” Stuart said. “The EPA guidelines are much higher than Maryland’s threshold. So we’re not going to be able to rely on the EPA.”
With the strong pushback from communities in Orange county as well as Essex County, Synagro has put a pause on the Essex permit process to see how things play out in Orange, a DEQ representative told the Water Control Board last week.
Legislators will decide the next steps for PFAS testing of biosolids in the upcoming General Assembly session in January. If they fail to take action, there could be negative consequences for Virginia’s agricultural industry and communities, some experts warn.
“If we just let this come to pass, and we apply these biosolids and we don’t test we can look at places like Maine as an outcome, right? Where there’s now dairy cattle and milk, which is heavily contaminated to the point that, you know, farmers have to dump the milk and can’t sell it anymore and you can’t just clean it up. That farmland is lost,” UVA’s Berger said.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)The longest government shutdown in American history ended less than two weeks ago, but the battle over Affordable Care Act credits and Americans’ health care access still rages in Congress. Approximately 100,000 Virginians could lose their health insurance if the credits lapse, lawmakers and advocates say. 
Virginia’s Democratic congressional delegation has staunchly supported extending the credits, which help people buy health insurance via the ACA marketplace and are set to expire at the end of December. Now, it’s time for Virginia’s Republican U.S. Reps. Rob Wittman and Jen Kiggans to make good on promises they made before the shutdown and during it.
Virginia Democrats and some Republicans want to extend ACA tax credits as shutdown looms

Specifically, Wittman, who represents Virginian’s 1st Congressional District, and Kiggans, who represents Virginia’s 2nd District, should prove they did not lie when they pledged to protect their constituents’ access to Medicaid and affordable health care.
Virginia’s other GOP representatives also should support access to Medicaid and affordable health care by extending the insurance subsidies. Sadly, they all lacked the courage to sign pledges promising to do so. 
 Ahead of the shutdown, Wittman and Kiggans signed letters to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate saying they would not vote for a budget with cuts in Medicaid, which pays medical bills for the poor and disabled. 
Wittman and Kiggans also questioned the wisdom of their Republican party’s plan to let federal subsidies that made health insurance affordable for millions of low-income, working class, and middle-class families expire at the end of the year.
But then, they both voted for Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” that cut Medicaid and let insurance subsidies expire. In doing so, Wittman and Kiggans set the stage for millions of Americans  — including tens of thousands in their districts — to lose access to health care and face financial ruin from medical debt.
So, like their GOP peers, Wittman and Kiggans betrayed their constituents who likely will suffer untreated illnesses or crushing doctor bills in the current budget. Their “no” votes could have defeated the current budget bill.
Senate Democrats felt so strongly about this that they refused to pass the budget without affordable health care measures. And so, the shutdown began. 
Wittman, particularly, spent the shutdown talking about how he voted for a “clean budget” that would have kept the government running temporarily, but which Democrats blocked over health care issues. Wittman implied that the temporary budget left time for negotiating those issues.  
Kiggans was among a bi-partisan group of House members who offered a bill in September to extend health insurance subsidies for a year to allow more time to negotiate a more permanent extension or put in replacement health insurance subsidies. 
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson never brought that bill to the floor for a vote. Instead, he adjourned the House when the shutdown started so no new legislation could be offered.
Kaine breaks with Democrats to back deal ending shutdown, securing protections for federal workers

U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia was among seven Democrats and one independent who broke ranks with their party’s leadership to reach a compromise deal to re-open the government. The Senate compromise  included a guarantee of a vote on extending health insurance subsidies by mid-December in the upper chamber. Johnson still has not agreed to allow that vote in his chamber.
At this point, it is up to Republican representatives like Wittman and Kiggans who promised to support access to affordable health care and Medicaid  to live up to that promise. They must do whatever they can to enable and support a vote that extends health insurance subsidies before those subsidies expire.
If Wittman and Kiggans still lack the courage to do that, they will have betrayed their constituents for a second time.

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The first turkey has yet to be carved, and the first present has yet to be opened, but thanks to Arkansas’ inexplicably early March primary, we’re arrived at election season before the first forkful of stuffing.
Our 2026 political feast features Democrats not running, a governor bent on revenge, Supreme Court justices playing musical chairs, rematches, grudge matches and a would-be sheriff on trial for murder, with a pair of juicy sex scandals thrown in for dessert.
So let’s set the table.
 Is Less Really A Strategy?

Given the turmoil Donald Trump and his minions have unleashed over the past year, weak approval numbers for Republicans, and the energy we’ve seen during No Kings protests across the state, we might have expected Arkansas Democrats to field a bumper crop of candidates trying to capitalize on what looks to be a more favorable than usual political environment.
That didn’t happen. Democrats conceded races for lieutenant governor, attorney general, treasurer, auditor and the open seat for land commissioner without firing a shot. By contrast, in 2022, Democrats ran candidates in all of those races, albeit without success.
In the battle for the Arkansas House, Democrats are contesting 46 of 100 seats, including just 25 Republican-held seats. Two years ago, they contested 64, the highest number in more than a decade, including 46 Republican-held seats.
The relative paucity of candidates means Democrats would have to flip nine of the 25 contested seats, without losing any of their own, to break the Republicans’ three-quarters supermajority, an advantage that lets them pass appropriation bills without Democratic input. To break the Senate supermajority, Democrats would need wins in all three contested Republican-held seats.
New Democratic Party Chair Marcus Jones has explained that the party is running fewer candidates in more winnable races to maximize resources. Republicans have scoffed at that claim, calling the lack of candidates a symptom of Democrats’ “disarray,” rather than any discernable strategy.
The smaller number of Democratic candidates in this cycle is perhaps understandable considering that two years ago, Democrats managed to flip just one Republican-held seat, that of Rep. Diana Gonzales Worthen, D-Springdale. 
Getting people to expend blood, sweat and tears on political races that they’re unlikely to win is a tough sell. But it’s also true that you can’t win if you don’t run.
Sanders Got Mad, But Can She Get Even?
Thwarted in her efforts to push through an ill-considered plan to build a mega-prison in Franklin County, Gov. Sarah Sanders followed through with threats to support primary challenges to two senators who defied her will, Bryan King, R-Green Forest, and Ron Caldwell, R-Wynne.
To challenge Caldwell, Sanders — who upon taking office made noisy protestations about the threat posed by TikTok — got behind a TikTok influencer, Trey (@BoDirt) Bohannan, who quickly ran into thorny questions about how long he’s lived in the 10th District.
To oust King, the governor is supporting Bobby Ballinger, the son of former Sen. Bob Ballinger. King has a long history with the family Ballinger, losing to the father in 2018 and then defeating him to reclaim the seat in 2022.
The primary is in March, and the legislative fiscal session begins in April. If Sanders is successful in defeating Caldwell or King, it’s likely to strengthen her hand in getting legislators to approve her pet prison project. But if her revenge tour falls flat, her leverage could evaporate.
Is This the Year French Finally Gets Fried?
Buoyed by a racially gerrymandered map that Republicans in the Arkansas Legislature pushed through to make his life easier, 2nd District Congressman French Hill defeated Marcus Jones by nearly 18 points in 2024.
But this time around, he’ll likely be facing Chris Jones, the pastor and rocket scientist who captured the public’s imagination with a spirited but ultimately doomed run against Sanders in 2022.
Chris Jones’ decision to opt against a rematch with Sanders puts her on a glide path toward re-election and gives him a more winnable (though still uphill) race against Hill, presuming Jones overcomes primary challenger Zack Huffman, a teacher from Little Rock.
Hill is also facing an interesting Republican primary challenge from Chase McDowell, a consultant from Little Rock who is running as a Trump-loving Christian conservative but who is also making an anti-establishment, affordability-based pitch to voters.
On his website, McDowell takes a whack at “party leaders who’ve forgotten what it means to work with calloused hands and humble hearts” — a sentiment that could resonate in a race against a congressman who spends a good deal of his time in Washington protecting the banking industry and promoting cryptocurrency.
Can the Farm Crisis Stunt the Cotton Crop?
Democrat Hallie Shoffner burst onto the political scene last March at a town hall in Little Rock, when she moved the crowd with the story of how she recently lost a farm near Newport that had been in her family for six generations. That personal narrative is at the center of her campaign to unseat U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton. 
Shoffner is making an appeal to rural voters affected by the farm crisis, voters who in recent years have been positively allergic to Democratic candidates. The fact that the woes facing Arkansas agriculture have been made much worse by Trump’s tariffs, which Cotton has done nothing to oppose, might make that argument easier.
While improving her numbers in rural Arkansas could potentially make this seat more competitive, running statewide against an entrenched incumbent is expensive. And while Shoffner has raised a respectable $660,000 so far, she hasn’t attracted the outside support she’ll likely need to overcome Cotton’s incumbency and campaign war chest.
 How Many Seats Can Supreme Court Seat-Switchers Switch?

 Supreme Court justices Cody Hiland and Nicholas Bronni were both barred from seeking re-election because they were appointed by Sanders, and state law precludes appointees from taking advantage of incumbency to perpetuate themselves in office.
But fear not! Hiland and Bronni are getting around this pesky law by running for each other’s seats on the high court, which complies with the letter of the law but blows its spirit to smithereens.
No one filed to run against Hiland, but Bronni drew a challenge from Little Rock attorney John Adams, a former assistant attorney general who represented the plaintiffs in a successful challenge to the library censorship law pushed through by Republican legislators.
Dangerous Vigilante, or Sheriff-Elect?
Charged with murder for shooting the man accused of molesting his daughter, Carlisle father Aaron Spencer turned the tables by running for Lonoke County sheriff against incumbent Jeff Staley.
Spencer’s trial, almost certain to generate an avalanche of publicity, is set for late January; the election is in early March. Given the wave of public sympathy for Spencer since his arrest, an acquittal could turn him from murder defendant to the county’s top law enforcement officer — and probably bring “Dateline” to town.
Is the Second (or Third) Time a Charm?
There are seven House races where Democrats who didn’t succeed in 2024 have returned for another shot at their Republican rivals. Two of them — Dexter Miller of Helena-West Helena and Rey Hernandez of Rogers — are running for a third time.
If this all seems a bit Sisyphean, it’s worth noting that Gonzales Worthen won her seat on the second try in 2024. 
Too Sexy for My … Re-Election?
Two incumbents seeking re-election are battling not only their opponents but unhelpful headlines about messiness in their personal lives.
Will Jones, the prosecutor in Pulaski and Perry counties, made a pre-emptive televised mea culpa after his wife, a North Little Rock district judge, caught him in flagrante delicto with his married chief deputy, an indiscretion that set social media on fire.
Even before watching his marriage implode on Facebook, Jones was already facing a strong challenge from Little Rock criminal defense attorney Bobby Forrest Jr.
Meanwhile, in Russellville, Republican Rep. Matt Duffield, a former pro wrestler, got a bit of chair to the face after police investigating a string of burglaries stopped two women in a car outside of his house, one of whom had a “wad of cash” and a previous prostitution conviction.
He will face Russellville pastor David Howell in the primary and, should he survive, Democrat Jennifer Lewter, a biology professor at Arkansas Tech, in the general election.
Food Coma, or Upset Tummy?
And so with the table set, let us proceed to the political feast, hopeful that our candidates will get to enjoy the last, sweet piece of pie, rather than getting stuck washing the dishes.

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)As the movement to return more sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations is poised to continue in the upcoming legislative session, tribal leaders say recent events underscored the benefits that even piecemeal wins have delivered for the tribes. 
When federal food assistance was suspended during the federal government shutdown, the longest in the county’s history, the Penobscot Nation reallocated thousands of dollars to bridge the gap, also relying on donated moose meat from hunters.  
“That was extremely taxing and stressful,” Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis told the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee earlier this month, “and without the resources that we’ve been able to gain by our own decisionmaking in an unrestricted way, we would not have been able to … supplement food programs.”
The Penobscot Council meets in the administration building on the Indian Island Reservation. (Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)
The Penobscot Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and Mi’kmaq Nation — collectively known as the Wabanaki Nations — are treated differently than other federally recognized tribes, more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations because of a 1980 land settlement agreement. Wabanaki leaders have said that their Tribes signed the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act to get fair compensation for stolen lands, not to give up the level of sovereignty that has been interpreted by the state and courts to date. 
Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has approached changing this dynamic on a case-by-case basis, such as expanding Wabanaki authority over prosecuting crimes, permitting the Tribes to handle and reap profits from sports betting, and aligning the tax code with the rules that apply to other tribal nations throughout the country. 
Those financial gains are what helped the Penobscot Nation fill the food assistance gap, Francis said. Revenue from the sports betting change in particular helped the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians replace and refurbish housing stock, Maliseet Chief Clarissa Sabattis said, but the Tribe still only has about 90 units to offer its about 2,000 citizens.
“Those things trickle down,” Sabattis said. “It does affect the livelihood and the health of our people.” 
Piecemeal changes have helped, Francis, Sabbatis and other Wabanaki chiefs say, but the remaining barriers to self-governance leave persistent disparities between tribal citizens and other Mainers, such as health inequalities and limited economic mobility.
The Maine Legislature formally recognized a need to alter the Settlement Act in 2019 by tasking a bipartisan group of state legislators and tribal chiefs to recommend changes. Those 22 recommended changes have since been taken up in several proposals with varying success and will again be considered when lawmakers return in January.  
Other changes being considered 
Two bills that the Legislature will contemplate next year are nearly identical to past proposals that were blocked either by the governor or through the Legislature’s opaque funding process.  
LD 785 is omnibus legislation that would implement the remaining task force recommendations, while LD 395 focuses on just one of the recommendations, restoring the Wabanaki Nations’ access to beneficial federal laws. Both are sponsored by Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland).
The omnibus legislation is essentially the proposal that the Legislature initially passed in 2022, but lawmakers on the budget committee did not fund the bill, essentially killing it, despite its relatively small fiscal note.
The proposal regarding federal laws mirrors a bill that the Legislature passed in 2023 but Mills vetoed, writing in her veto letter that she doesn’t “want to see the Wabanaki Nations unfairly excluded from benefits that are generally available to federally recognized tribes” but she fears the way the legislation sought to do so would “result in years, if not decades, of new, painful litigation that would exacerbate our government-to-government relationship and only further divide the state.” 
The Settlement Act made it so federal legislation that applies to all other tribes doesn’t apply to the Wabanaki Nations unless explicitly written into the law. LD 385 would flip this paradigm by allowing the Wabanaki Nations to access federal laws unless they are expressly excluded. 
Among the many federal laws that do not apply to the Wabanaki Nations is one that offers federally recognized tribes the right to exclusively regulate and take in revenue from gambling on tribal lands.
Expanding on the 2022 sports betting law, lawmakers earlier this year attempted to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine and afford the Tribes more revenue from gambling at private casinos. The latter legislation is being carried over into next session, while the igaming bill was held by the governor, meaning Mills can either veto it within the first three days of session or allow it to become law without her signature.  
Candidates’ support signals tribal rights may be a top issue for Maine’s next governor

Mills vetoed other legislation this year that sought to prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use. 
When asked how Mills will approach the issue of tribal sovereignty next session, press secretary Ben Goodman wrote in a statement that “the governor looks forward to working collaboratively with Tribal leaders and the Legislature to build upon the progress of recent years.” 
The Governor’s Office declined to share Mills’ stance on specific legislation, with Goodman writing, “The governor will review each bill as part of the upcoming session.”
Given Mill’s earlier objections, there is skepticism that the pending bills will ultimately be successful next year. But with Mills termed out (and running for U.S. Senate) in 2026, the proposals could have more luck under the next administration, as several gubernatorial candidates have already made day one pledges to restore full sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations.  
Craig Sanborn, legal counsel for the Mi’kmaq Nation and citizen of the Penobscot Nation, told Maine Morning Star that although the governor hasn’t been amenable to several of the ways the Wabanaki Nations have sought to have their sovereignty returned, “at the end of the day, as she says, we keep coming back.”
“The relationship is not a short-term relationship,” he said, “Obviously, we’ve been here forever. The relationship that we try to build on is something that is a long game… we want to leave on a high note with her.”
While acknowledging the uncertain outcome of the current legislation, he said it is clear there have been improvements with tribal-state communication. 
Glimpses of that come from closed-door meetings, such as one between Mills and tribal leadership this fall, which Mi’kmaq Nation Chief Sheila McCormack described as positive. 
It’s also evident publicly, such as in the decision by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians earlier this year to send a representative back to the Legislature for the first time since 2018. That representative is Brian Reynolds, who has been the tribal administrator for nearly two decades. 
The Penobscot Nation and Passamaquoddy Tribe also withdrew their representatives in 2015, citing frustration with the state not recognizing their sovereign rights and with former Republican Gov. Paul LePage rescinding an executive order that sought to improve cooperation with the Tribes. The Passamoquoddy Tribe has continued to send a representative, currently Aaron Dana. 
These representatives cannot officially cast votes but can do so symbolically and otherwise participate in debate and educate lawmakers.  
“We do feel like people are receptive now,” said Sabattis, chief of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, “and people want to learn.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4817-scaled-e1763739112212-1024x721.jpg,,,2025-11-24 05:58:57.597825

That’s the largest single-year decrease in over a decade. It also represents significant progress from the peak of the opioid epidemic, in which New Hampshire was among the hardest-hit states.

The Bulletin sat down with L’Heureux and Escalante to discuss what the state and the broader U.S. addiction treatment community is doing right, what it needs to continue doing, and what, if anything, might threaten that progress. The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
My first question for you is, given all this good news on drug fatalities, is what are we doing correctly right now?
Dr. Abby L’Heureux
L’Heureux: We know from the evidence that there are things that work.
There are three FDA-approved medications for opioid use disorder: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Those are the only treatments for opioid use disorder proven to reduce overdose mortality. So getting people access to those is incredibly important, and most likely is contributing to the decrease in mortality that we’ve seen in New Hampshire. 
Getting people access means making sure they have insurance; making sure they’re not underinsured; having clinics and providers available to provide this kind of treatment; training those providers well; decreasing things like prior authorizations for those medications; making sure we’re targeting the most vulnerable people — people like minorities, LGBTQIA folks, immigrants, people with co-occurring severe mental illness, things like that — making sure that they have access to treatment, that they can get to care.
And then there are community-based public health interventions that prevent opioid overdose itself. So I can’t say that those specifically reduce mortality, but we know that there are interventions that prevent opioid overdose, so things like naloxone (commonly known by the brand name Narcan) distribution, really making sure that everyone has access to that; screening for fentanyl routinely; syringe service programs; things like that. What New Hampshire is doing to further all of those is likely contributing to our continued success.
What are some things you think the New Hampshire medical community and policy makers need to continue doing to give you all the resources to continue this progress?
Annette Escalante
Escalante: I’ll be honest with you, while I think what the state has done has really been able to drive all these other helpful things for opioid use disorder, primarily it was the funding that came from the federal government — the state opioid response dollars that the state of New Hampshire received — that really made a huge impact. And then, of course, Medicaid coverage for SUD (substance use disorder) really opened up access for individuals to be able to receive medication for opiate use disorder and, of course, treatment in general. (Medicaid, the nation’s public health program, is the largest payer for SUD and mental health treatment; the Affordable Care Act of 2010 expanded the type of SUD treatment it could cover.) 
Also, the state, in 2023 with federal funding, created the Doorways program. There are nine locations all around the state, and folks can walk in, they can receive treatment. 
There’s also this huge opportunity now with folks living in sober housing we didn’t have before, and it actually is paid for through the Doorways program. So that is one of the better trends that happened.
And of course, with Medicaid expansion, what we’ve seen is that we now have more providers and more opportunities for treatment in the state. So we now have telehealth, which we didn’t have before. The access has gotten much better. (In 2014, New Hampshire expanded its local Medicaid program to cover a much larger swath of the population.) 
The distribution of Narcan and harm reduction kits that the Doorways program provides across the state has also been very helpful.
I think all those things have come together to reduce the numbers that we’re seeing right now for opioid overdoses.
There were a lot of things going on over the past few years: making Narcan over the counter, heavy investment from the state and federal government on prevention and mitigation, widespread education efforts. Do you credit any of these more than others?
Escalante: I think it’s a combination of everything, in all honesty. In my opinion, we really created a really great system here in New Hampshire, and we’ve been able to reduce that. But not just at the state level. We’re also looking at the cities, Manchester, Nashua, where people are doing their part. We have recovery centers now that have popped up. We’ve never had them before. They’re all over the state. That has also contributed to the decrease in those numbers.
L’Heureux: I don’t think we can really say. I don’t think we can establish direct causality. We can correlate what we’ve done to the outcomes we’re seeing. And I think probably, just like Annette said, it’s a combination of all of these things. And so it’s important to not rest on our laurels, to continue to fund these programs, to continue to pay attention to these things. It’s not like we can say, ‘Oh, we’ve arrived. We did the work, and now we can just rest.’ There is no cure for opioid use disorder, and so we’re going to have to continue all of these programs, all of the medical programs, all the behavioral health programs, all of the treatment centers, all the syringe service programs. Everything is contributing. Naloxone distribution is also really important. All of those things are playing a big role, I think, so it’s important to continue really making sure we don’t drop the ball.
Is there anything that threatens this progress we’ve made?
Escalante: Oh yeah. I think it’s the uncertainty of everything. The state’s Alcohol Fund was one of the ways that we were able to fund opioid use disorder efforts. And now, the Alcohol Fund is, through legislation, in General Funds, so we did not get the amount that we would normally have gotten this year. Also, the state has reduced $50 million from the Department of Health and Human Services budget, which, of course, has a huge impact on all of the SUD programs it’s involved with. And of course, with Medicaid being the biggest driver for treatment providers coming in and for folks being able to access treatment, all of that is up in the air.
People are starting to feel the uncertainty. We’ve worked really hard to try and get this whole system in the state to work and provide the services we need. And if we remove any of those pieces, the whole system could fall. And I hear that a lot from folks out in the community, and also at the commission who openly speak about what’s going to happen if we end up losing Medicaid.
And you’re referring to the Medicaid cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July?
Escalante: Yeah.
L’Heureux: I think one of the threats to our patients and to our success is a neglect of science and the evidence. We have good evidence to support the interventions that we’re currently using. We need to keep that in mind, remember that we know that these things work. And we want to be able to practice in a way that is consistent with science and the evidence that we have. We also need to continue research, so that we have even more options going forward, because our population is so vulnerable. We need to keep doing that, because there are a lot of threats to their continued success.
What’s the atmosphere like in treatment clinics, among SUD specialists, and the patients you treat these days? And how does that differ with past years?
L’Heureux: I think we’ve certainly had reason to celebrate in the last few years. I do think that things have gotten better. I think we’re always worried about our patients, because they are so vulnerable. They’re very vulnerable to all the things that we just talked about.
Are we aware of the successes? Yes, we are, and we do feel those successes, and we love those stories.
I don’t know this for sure, but I think for people looking in — for people who aren’t directly involved in substance use disorder treatment — it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. It’s easy for people to think, ‘Oh, we can’t fix that. It’s too overwhelming. It’s too big. There’s too much to do.’ And so it’s easy to just kind of give up. But I think it’s important to keep telling people: No, we have a lot of successes. We have evidence-based treatments. We have the tools to be able to be effective, to decrease mortality, to help people live healthier, successful, happier lives, and it’s not a lost cause. There are things we can do. We just need the resources, the funding, the attention, the people, everything that’s involved in getting to these great outcomes that we’re seeing.
Escalante: I just want to add that it’s important to let people know that people do recover.
L’Heureux: People recover. And boy, if you see one person recover, you watch one person graduate from recovery court, or you see one person get their kids back? Boy, everything becomes worth it. It’s just so worth it. People recover all the time, and it’s amazing and beautiful.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hassansubstance-1024x638.jpg,,,2025-11-24 05:58:57.597825

Mike DeWine speaking at an event. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has some decisions to make on property tax reform. State lawmakers have signed off on five proposals in recent weeks, and now they’re headed for DeWine’s desk.
Although the governor has expressed concern about rising property taxes, he has bucked earlier legislative proposals tucked into the state budget.
Lawmakers initially promised to override several of those vetoes but pulled back after overriding just one, which prohibited certain kinds of levies including substitute and emergency levies.
Instead, Republican lawmakers in the House launched a kind of property tax blitzkrieg, led in large part by former Ashtabula County auditor, state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson.
Thomas is a primary sponsor on all five of the bills lawmakers sent to DeWine.

The proposals empower county officials to pare back levies previously approved by voters, create more room for tax reductions, limit the growth of tax bills to the rate of inflation, and shift the burden of proof in valuation disputes.
On the Ohio Senate floor last week, another former Ashtabula County auditor, state Sen. Sandra O’Brien, R-Ashtabula, reduced it to a simple equation.
“Our taxpayers, whom we represent, want property tax relief,” she said. “The bills that we are about to vote on, offer them that relief.”
Ohio’s governor, lawmakers, and grassroots organizers are all wrestling over property tax reform

She reminded lawmakers they have little margin for error with grassroots organizers around the state collecting signatures for a ballot measure eliminating property taxes outright.
“That scenario, if successful, would place Ohio at the edge of the abyss,” O’Brien said. “Today, we have the chance to show the taxpayers of Ohio that we hear their pleas for property tax relief.”
Speaking at an event Friday, DeWine pointed to the property tax working group he set up after vetoing lawmakers’ budget proposals.
He explained the group was tasked with “coming up with solutions where there’s no great solutions, frankly, no matter what we do.”
The working group had to balance funding for local services like schools against homeowners struggling to make ends meet.
DeWine acknowledged he doesn’t like all the compromises they reached, but insisted the group did a very good job.
“So, I’ll judge those bills based upon what the committee came up with,” he said, “and in a few days, we’ll have some comments about that.”
How the bills compare to recommendations
Ohio House Bills 186 and 335 together limit the increase of property taxes to overall rate of inflation.
The state constitution gives local governments the authority to levy up to 10 mills (or 1%) of property tax without prior voter approval.
That constitutionally guaranteed amount is known as inside millage, while any additional taxes approved at the ballot are known as outside millage.
Ohio House Bill 186 applies to outside millage and Ohio House Bill 335 applies to inside millage.
DeWine’s working group explicitly endorsed the former and encouraged lawmakers to apply the same inflationary cap to inside millage.
Here’s where the Ohio House property tax reform bills stand in the Ohio Senate

Ohio has a tax reduction system that lowers a homeowners rates to keep their tax bill steady for decades. But there’s an important limitation. The total amount of school levies can’t dip below 20 mills.
Ohio House Bill 129 includes additional taxes in the calculation of the 20-mill floor.
In particular the substitute and emergency levies lawmakers prohibited going forward didn’t previously count toward the floor.
The working group suggested they should and be renamed as fixed sum levies, as well. I
mportantly, the members urged lawmakers to maintain a 12.5% state share of funding if those taxes get renewed.
Without that so-called ‘rollback’ districts would get less money for the same levy. All told, the gap would be about $96 million.
Lawmakers agreed to keep the rollback, but in the House version, allowed for only one renewal of expiring levies.
Critics warned that would delay rather than solve the problem. The Senate tacked on an amendment to allow ongoing renewals.
Ohio House Bill 309 allows the county budget commission, made up the local auditor, treasurer, and prosecutor, to reduce voted levies they deem unnecessary or excessive.
DeWine’s veto message said that “breaches” voters’ approval.
His property tax working group determined the commission should have the authority but insisted on guardrails.  They recommended a five-year safe harbor for new levies and two years for renewals.
The group also said there should be explicit definitions of “excessive” and “unnecessary.”
State lawmakers took up the definitions, and in the House, they agreed to a five-year safe harbor for new levies.
Renewals, however, would be eligible for reductions immediately.
In the Senate, lawmakers trimmed further — reducing the protections to just one year after voter approval.
Ohio House Bill 124 gives county auditors the benefit of the doubt when it comes to property valuations.
Ohio counties do a full reappraisal on six-year cycles, but they update values three years in based on statistical trends.
Under current law, if state tax officials object to the county’s math, the auditor’s only option is to go to the board of tax appeals.
The bill would instead put the onus on the Department of Taxation to bring an appeal if it disputes the auditor’s findings.
That proposal wasn’t part of the working group’s recommendations, but it cruised through committee without any opposition.

Many factors can influence a police agency’s clearance rate, including how quickly evidence is processed by crime labs. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Police departments’ “clearance rates” — the percentage of cases they declare closed — are one of the most widely cited benchmarks for how effectively they combat crime. Lawmakers reference clearance rates in hearings, mayors cite them during police budget debates, and community members often use them to judge how well their local department is functioning.
But the figures can be confusing — and in some cases misleading.
State lawmakers are pushing to better understand and improve clearance rates, as crime remains top of mind for many Americans and a defining issue in statehouses nationwide.
Efforts to help solve more crimes and support victims have become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. This year, lawmakers in Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Texas have considered or enacted measures that would boost police investigative capacity or improve crime data and clearance rate reporting.
A new law in Illinois will require all law enforcement agencies to publish routine clearance data on nonfatal shootings and homicides starting in July 2026.
Missouri enacted a similar law, which will go into effect in 2026, that directs the state’s Department of Public Safety to publish clearance rates statewide and create a new grant program to help police departments solve violent crimes. And Texas lawmakers established a pilot program to set up rapid DNA testing facilities in two counties.
Lawmakers and police officials in some of these states say raising clearance rates is both a public safety priority and a matter of providing closure for victims and families. Research suggests that the likelihood of being caught is one of the strongest deterrents to committing a crime — making clearance rates a closely watched indicator of how well the justice system is working.
Forensic crime labs are buckling as new technology increases demand

Clearing crimes is critical for public safety because it takes repeat offenders off the streets, helps resolve cases that never made it into official reports, delivers justice for victims, and strengthens the community trust that helps police solve future cases, said Thaddeus Johnson, an assistant professor of criminal justice and criminology at Georgia State University. Johnson, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice, also served as a police officer in Memphis, Tennessee, for a decade.
“Clearance rate reflects police actions, but also the vibe and how the community feels –– the confidence and faith they have in the police,” Johnson said.
Across the country, clearance rates for violent crimes — including homicide, rape and aggravated assault — have declined for decades. The national homicide clearance rate, for example, has fallen from 72% in 1980 to 61% in 2024, the most recent year with FBI data available.
The decline is similar across other major crime categories. In 1980, police cleared 49% of rapes and 59% of aggravated assaults. By 2024, those figures had fallen to 27% and 49%, respectively. Robbery clearance rates also shifted over time, rising from 24% in 1980 to 30% in 2024.
But those figures reflect national averages. At the local level, clearance rates vary widely, with some departments solving a large share of cases while others struggle with consistently low numbers.
Police departments in Vermont, Delaware and Idaho had the highest violent crime clearance rates in 2024, while New Mexico, Georgia and Mississippi had the lowest, according to a 50-state crime data analysis by the nonpartisan, nonprofit Council of State Governments Justice Center.
Some experts say there are several reasons clearance rates can swing in either direction. Chronic staffing shortages, overwhelmed detective units, rising caseloads and strained community relationships can push rates down. Strong victim and witness cooperation, better investigative technology and clearance of older backlogged cases can push them up.
At the same time, clearance rates — like most crime statistics — have limitations and can be difficult to understand.
Clearance rates, explained
A clearance rate is meant to show how often police solve reported crimes in a given year. The formula is simple — cleared cases divided by reported cases — but the definition of “cleared” is broad.
Under federal rules, cases can be cleared either by arrest or by “exceptional means.” Arrest clearances are straightforward: Police make an arrest, file charges and hand the case to prosecutors.
Trump isn’t sending troops to cities with highest crime rates, data shows

Exceptional clearances apply when police say they have enough evidence to arrest someone but cannot do so for reasons outside their control — for example, when a suspect has died, fled the country, is being held in another jurisdiction that won’t extradite, or when prosecutors decline to bring charges or victims choose not to move forward.
Since agencies have wide discretion in using exceptional clearances, similar cases may be counted as “solved” in one community and remain open in another. High exceptional clearance rates can give the impression that more arrests have been made than actually have.
Timing also complicates the statistics. Clearances are counted in the year a case is closed, not the year the crime occurred. For crimes that routinely take months or years to investigate, such as homicides or sexual assaults, this is common.
As a result, departments that focus on long-term investigations or suddenly receive new evidence may clear a batch of older cases, making their current-year rate look higher even though more recent cases remain unresolved.
Most agencies do not publicly break down how many of their annual clearances involve older cases, but that doesn’t mean they are intentionally manipulating their statistics.
National reporting isn’t airtight either. The FBI’s crime reporting program is voluntary, and some police departments may submit crime data but skip clearance data altogether.
Other measures of effectiveness
A clearance does not guarantee that prosecutors filed charges or that a case resulted in a conviction — outcomes that often matter most to victims and their families. It also doesn’t capture whether the right person was apprehended.
“It’s an imperfect metric for the performance of our criminal justice system,” said Marc Krupanski, the criminal justice policy director at Arnold Ventures, a philanthropic research organization.

– Marc Krupanski, criminal justice policy director at Arnold Ventures



Clearance rates also say little about investigative quality, how consistently police update families, how quickly officers respond or whether residents feel comfortable coming forward with information in the first place.
For these reasons, experts recommend looking at other measures, including prosecutorial outcomes, police response times, victim satisfaction and levels of community trust.
Some experts say clearance rates are most meaningful when analyzed over time — ideally 10 to 20 years — and adjusted per capita or per 100,000 residents. Breaking out clearances by arrest and exceptional means also adds important context, as does examining how many arrests lead to charges or convictions.
These outcomes, experts say, reflect both police work and community cooperation — from gathering witnesses to processing crime scenes and maintaining evidence — offering a clearer picture of investigative effectiveness.
Michigan’s proposal
Just last month, Michigan lawmakers introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at boosting the state’s clearance rates. Last year, Michigan police solved 48% of violent crimes, according to the Council of State Governments Justice Center’s analysis.
Cashless bail, explained: What it is, how it works and why Trump is targeting it

The House and Senate versions of the Violent Crime Clearance Act are sponsored by Republican state Rep. Sarah Lightner and Democratic state Sen. Stephanie Chang. The legislation would create a statewide grant program for police departments, allowing them to use the funds to hire and train investigators or crime lab personnel, upgrade evidence-collection equipment or record-management systems and support witnesses in violent crime investigations. It would also establish strict clearance rate reporting requirements.
“Regardless of where you sit on the political spectrum, I think there’s just a general belief that we want crimes to be solved,” Chang told Stateline.
Rural police departments, which often have fewer staff and limited investigative resources, sometimes face challenges in solving certain types of cases. To help address this, the bill would require that grants be distributed across the state, and that no single agency receive more than 20% of the total program funding in a given year.
Supporters, including Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard, say the legislation would provide much-needed help for overburdened departments.
“These aren’t just statistics. These are people. … They were dragged into the criminal justice system as a victim, and so for us, each case — and trying to find and bring closure, whether it’s an armed robbery, a rape or a murder — is critically important,” Bouchard said.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderEach year, about 700 young adults age out of foster care in Georgia and lose access to the supports available to them while they were part of the state’s system. 
In recent years, state lawmakers have created and expanded a tax credit program designed to help ease the transition. Now, a Senate study committee is taking a closer look at how the state Legislature can help this vulnerable group of Georgians.
The committee, led by Marietta Republican Sen. Kay Kirkpatrick, unveiled a series of recommendations Friday aimed at addressing persistent gaps in housing, education and employment opportunities among young adults who have experienced the foster care system. 
“There are more recommendations that we could have made, but we’ve always worked towards trying to make this actionable,” Kirkpatrick said. “We may not be able to do all of these in a year, but there are several things on here that we definitely can make progress on.”
Those proposals include working with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to improve participation in a federal housing voucher program for former foster children, creating a “one stop shop” for foster kids to access state programs online, and appropriating funding for Senate Bill 85, a scholarship program for former foster children that was passed into law earlier this year but doesn’t yet include the state funding needed to implement it.
It also urges state leaders to take full advantage of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump last week that seeks to improve career and educational opportunities for youth aging out of the foster care system.
Lawmakers say they will begin drafting new legislation and collaborating with state and federal agencies ahead of the 2026 legislative session, which begins in January. They hope that new policies will help prevent older foster children from falling through the cracks as they transition to adulthood.
Advocates say that children who exit Georgia’s foster care system without a permanent placement often face serious challenges, with many experiencing poverty, homelessness, and incarceration. John DeGarmo, who has also served as a foster parent to more than 60 kids in Georgia, said the lack of resources and support leaves these young adults particularly isolated, and vulnerable to mental health issues and online predators.
“Can you imagine having an 18-year-old child, kicking them out of the house when they turn 18 and saying, ‘hey, you’re on your own,’ no support services, no one to talk to,” said DeGarmo, who is also the founder of an advocacy group known as the Foster Care Institute. “That’s what happens to so many of these youth when they turn 18.”
Georgia launched a new tax credit program in 2023, which allowed individuals and businesses to receive dollar-for-dollar state income tax credits when they donate to an approved organization that serves children in Georgia’s foster care program. The program, known as the Fostering Success Act, raised $9.7 million during its first year, and provides former foster kids with help paying for rent, groceries, transportation and educational expenses. 
Today, that program has expanded to help more than 400 young adults who have aged out of the state’s foster care system, according to Heidi Carr, the executive director of Fostering Success Act, Inc., a nonprofit that helps issue funds to eligible youth. 
For JC Powers, a 22-year-old information systems student at Kennesaw State University who entered the foster care system at age 13, the tax credit program helped ease the “free fall” he experienced after aging out.
“You see the statistics, lots of people end up homeless, I ended up homeless,” he said. “Lots of people end up in abusive relationships and all of these things that are preventable, because they don’t have the supports that are needed.”
But Powers said that receiving the scholarship, which helps him afford rent, groceries, car expenses, and school supplies, was “life changing.” 
“One day I’m freaked out, stressed out of my mind,” he said. “Then the next day it’s like, ‘oh, okay, I can breathe.’”

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)Ohio lawmakers have brought back up a bill that would add party labels to candidates in local school board elections with a newly added amendment that would eliminate all elected seats on the State Board of Education, making the entire body governor-appointed.
The Senate General Government Committee last week heard from supporters of Ohio Senate Bill 107, a bill whose original intent was to add partisan affiliation to school board races.
With changes made in the committee, the bill would also follow through on state operating budget action from this summer, in which the General Assembly approved a measure to reduce the board to five members, all appointed.
Currently, the board is made up of eight appointed members and 11 elected members.
Under the budget measure, the spots filled by elected members will disappear when the current officials’ terms expire or in the event of a vacancy.
The three appointed spots to be eliminated will be lost when the three earliest terms expire, or a vacancy occurs.
Back in 2023, the the legislature officially eliminated a significant amount of the roles for the board, leaving them with authority to address educator discipline and school district territorial disputes.
The changes came as board officials and the state’s superintendent of public instruction sounded alarm bells about the financial state of the board, concerns that have continued through this year.

Supporters of the measure to give partisan labels to local board candidates included Lisa Breedlove Chaffee, who said she was a member of a group called Parents Rights in Education, and parent of a former Hilliard City Schools student.
Chaffee was one plaintiff in a lawsuit against the school, saying teachers in the district were having “inappropriate” conversations with students regarding LGBTQIA+ identities. That lawsuit was later dismissed.
In the matter of school board members, she said holding elections for those races without partisan labels leaves voters without the ability the vet the values of the candidates.
“We see names on ballots, but no clues about a candidate’s values or potential biases,” Chaffee told the committee.
“In today’s climate — marked by national flashpoints over curriculum, parental rights, and even basic literacy — that’s no longer acceptable.”
She argued the information would empower more Ohioans to vote, and those voters to do more research.
Asked whether she felt like it would actually lead voters to choose candidates based on party alone, she acknowledged that people often vote the same party all the way down the ballot, but this bill would make people feel more comfortable voting in the first place.
“I’m guilty of it, if I don’t see an ‘R’ beside someone’s name or an ‘I,’ I don’t vote in that particular race, so I think this will actually encourage people to vote more, and I hope people will do their research to begin with,” she said.
The Ohio chapter of conservative group Americans for Prosperity submitted testimony urging support for the bill, and calling party affiliation “a key piece of information that helps voters understand a candidate’s general philosophy, approach to governance, and likely policy positions.”
“By requiring party designation, S.B. 107 ensures that voters are not left guessing about where candidates stand on important issues,” wrote Hannah Kubbins, legislative director for the group.
The bill was introduced in February, and last week’s hearing was the first public comment on the measure, indicating there will be further hearings for those who oppose the bill and other interested parties.

“This legislation codifies that female inmates must be provided as many feminine hygiene products as necessary at all correctional facilities, local, county and state, at no cost,” Ohio Sen. Susan Manchester, R-Waynesfield, said during Wednesday’s Senate session. 
The bipartisan bill — introduced by Democratic state Rep. Latyna M. Humphrey and Republican state Rep. Marilyn John —  also requires correctional facilities to allow female inmates to shower once per day while menstruating. 
“(This) is an important piece of legislation that ensures female inmates in Ohio are treated with dignity and respect during their incarceration,” Manchester said. “Feminine hygiene products are a necessity, not a luxury.”
Former inmates shared during committee testimony their experiences of needing tampons and needs. 
“There were times when pads were limited, tampons unavailable, or distribution controlled in a way that made women feel powerless and degraded,” said Antonette Smith, a former inmate at the Ohio Reformatory for Women. “Some of us had to choose between using toilet paper, reusing products, or going without altogether.” 
Erin Noll, who served 12 years in prison, recalled begging for products. 
“When I would run out of sanitaries I would have to go to the male officers working at the time and beg for sanitaries,” she said. “If they said no because they were locked in a closet and they didn’t feel like getting them for me at the time, I would have to go inmate to inmate begging them for their extra sanitaries.”
The federal government started offering free access to menstrual products for federal inmates starting in 2017 and 25 states have laws requiring free access to feminine hygiene products in prisons, according to the Ohio Justice and Policy Center. 
“The absence of a formal policy leaves decisions to the discretion of prison staff, creating inconsistencies and opportunities for abuse,” Humphrey said during her sponsor testimony. “Passing H.B. 29 is not just about fairness — it’s about demonstrating Ohio’s commitment to humane treatment and basic public health.”
There were about 3,660 female inmates at the Ohio Reformatory for Women, the Dayton Correctional Institution and the Northeast Reintegration Center as of March.

(Getty Images)A news brief on the 2022 death of 28-year-old Dylan Walstrom of Topeka, citing the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said he died after exiting a car, shooting at the officer, and struggling “for control of a handgun.”
The KBI said Walstrom “refused several of the officer’s commands,” and, “during the struggle, Walstrom fired once at the officer, who fired several shots in return.”
That explanation troubled Walstrom’s mother, Carrie Bell, a Kansas native who lives in Texas. She asked lawyer LaRonna Lassiter Saunders to view the body cam video.

After an unnamed Topeka police officer shot Dylan Walstrom in the head during a 2022 traffic stop, police claimed Walstrom had fired his gun first — but that’s not what the officer’s body cam video shows, according to an attorney who viewed it. (Submitted)

Lassiter Saunders, and a Chicago expert Bell hired, said the video shows the officer firing first and that the KBI’s account doesn’t match video evidence. They ask: Who shoots and struggles after shots to the forehead?
Bell filed an Oct. 31 Kansas Open Records Act request for the officer’s name and “reimbursement for the burdensome expenses caused by the City Attorney’s withholding of bodycam footage and lack of transparency.” It’s another example of the city hiding video from the public.
The KBI “did make me believe my son shot at an officer,” Bell said. “He was shot twice in the head. He would have been incapacitated. Some things are just black and white. He shot my son twice, hesitated, and then shot him seven more times.”
Bell said she identified her son by his wrist tattoo.
The KORA request marked her third request for the officer’s name, and the clock has run out for any lawsuit.
Kansas Reflector has not seen the video.
The KBI responded to a request for comment by sending the agency’s original statement on the case. The city of Topeka did not respond to Kansas Reflector, but Bell said via email that the city denied her request.
“They said it was not in the best interest of the citizens of Topeka” to name the officer, she said.
Reports from 2018 said Topeka police found four stolen vehicles on Walstrom’s property when arresting him. Walstrom served prison time for felony theft. His December 2022 interface with police developed from a stolen car report.
Lassiter Saunders said the bodycam video showed the officer approached from the passenger side of the car where Walstrom slept in the driver’s seat. Walstrom seemed disoriented after waking up.
She said Walstrom attempted to open the door, but the officer told him “no.” Walstrom had a gun but never pointed it at the officer.
“As soon as (the officer) saw the gun, he shot twice from the driver’s side,” Lassiter Saunders said. “He then reached in and grabbed Dylan’s hand and shot him seven more times.”
The officer’s panic seemed reasonable, she said. What happened next didn’t.
Lassiter Saunders said the officer placed his weapon on a trash can behind him, calmly called for backup, said Walstrom tried to attack him and that he’d shot Walstrom.
“He killed him and then called in a lie,” she said. “This could have been explained. But what you can’t do is smoke him, make up a lie and then hide your identity.”
Bell hired Jennifer Matthews, a Chicago-area body camera video consultant who trains police departments on using body cams more effectively. Bell flew Matthews in to view the video.
Matthews’ report read, in part: “Upon careful review of the footage at a reduced speed (0.5x), it is evident that the first shot fired by the officer struck the driver directly in the center of the forehead. While I do not possess formal medical training, it is reasonable to infer that such a wound would likely result in immediate and significant incapacitation, potentially rendering the driver unable to continue any physical or cognitive function.”
The report continued: “Based on the available evidence, it is the expert’s opinion that the officer was the first to fire his weapon. … After the initial shot, the officer continued to fire multiple rounds, ultimately resulting in the driver’s death.”
The video revisits alarming variants between official accounts of police shootings and video evidence. About a month before police shot Walstrom to death, police fired more than 30 shots at Taylor Lowery, killing him.
The Shawnee County District Attorney’s Office exonerated the officers and claimed, despite video to the contrary, that Lowery lunged at police holding a knife above his head.
Video obtained by Kansas Reflector showed Lowery holding a wrench and backing away from officers as they began shooting.
Despite the answers the video has seemingly offered, questions remain for Bell.
Why lie about an explainable shooting? Why can’t a mother know who killed her child? Why did she have to spend $13,000 when that information should have been made available?
December will mark three years since the shooting. It hasn’t been easy. She’d planned to gift her son a car later that December for his birthday.
She said at first, she wondered how she could take on the police department, the city, the KBI, and all the law enforcement secrecy in Kansas. But an answer came from her son.
“My son, from the other side, said he would walk me through to the other side of what happened,” Bell said. “Little by little, it has been laid out. I’m not a religious freak or anything, but something is keeping me going.”

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As a Nebraskan, I’m confident in saying that we here like a good origin story. 
Perhaps it’s because we put considerable stock in the idea that where we’re from often guides where we’re going. Or perhaps it’s because we understand how the past connects to the present. Who knows? 
Maybe we’re just nosy about where our neighbors come from.
Whatever the reason, I hope Nebraskans watched “The American Revolution,” the new film from Ken Burns, Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt. The 12-hour series, which ran on PBS last week, is America’s original origin story. You can still stream it or catch it when PBS makes it available again. 
This particular origin story also has a strong undercurrent of irony, a riptide of cognitive dissonance. More on that below.
I enjoyed the film as a history nerd, journalist and Burns fan, so I’ll leave the reviews and any serious analysis to my betters from the film, television and academic worlds. 
I offer this critique only, one I heard from a number of “The American Revolution” viewers: The film “dragged.” I, too, found myself wanting to nudge the story along, part of which I’m sure was because I know this history. We know this history. We studied it in the eighth grade and again as high school juniors. College history majors perhaps found the film’s tempo excruciating.
But even after having read, researched and taught classes on pivotal moments such as what happened at Breed’s Hill, the film’s retelling of our story is rife with intimate details of the heroism, the gore, the stunning violence, the names of the dead and the fate of living that grace few history textbooks. 
For example, known familiarly as the Battle of Bunker Hill, valiant patriots on Breed’s Hill, their powder gone, their muskets misfiring, suffered enormous losses at the hands of King George’s redcoats who finally breached the hill’s barriers. While nearly 450 Americans died, the British lost over 1,000 men, a devastating blow even in a strategic victory, one that would impact British planning and execution during the ensuing years of fighting. 
While images of redcoats patrolling the streets of Boston had an eerie familiarity to it (see Washington D.C, Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago or Charlotte), irony struck me hard during the opening credits, when, among other donors, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was noted for its role in bringing “The American Revolution” to television. 
The CPB closed its doors on August 1 and will permanently shutter after the first of the year. The CPB, which for over 50 years supported PBS, NPR and local radio and television stations, was a casualty of the Big Ugly for its supposed “liberal bias.”
This just in: Bias is hard to find in America’s origin story. “The American Revolution” retells not only the narrative of our country’s inception, but also the germ of its organizing principles of liberty and democracy. The film does not shy away from the glaring incongruity of a fledgling nation at war to spread liberty across its colonies while maintaining a system that enslaved nearly a half million people, denying them liberty. Nor did it gloss over a similar discordance in the new country’s view of the liberties of Native people and of women.
It underscored, too, that the Revolutionary War was a civil war, pitting colonist against colonist, patriot against loyalist, neighbor against neighbor … all of whom might live on the same street in Boston or New York or Philadelphia. In some cases, families, too, were torn apart in the war for independence. 
The revolution also was a world war, as France and Spain found their way into the fray, following German Hessians who were already fighting for the Crown. Native nations, too, here for hundreds of years, at times fought during the war against both patriots and loyalists, even among themselves.
Some want to rewrite American history in our classrooms, our museums and our public spaces, to buff out any blemishes forever etched into our story. The effort is not simply misguided. It’s wrong. Any omission or euphemistic coddling of our missteps gets the history — the story — incorrect. 
Historians, teachers, writers, any American should stand against the whitewashing forces who want to dismiss swaths of who we were and how we got here.
“The American Revolution,” with its roster of noted historians, years of exacting scholarship and research and sterling storytelling, makes that stand … underscoring the remarkable origins of a remarkable place, remarkable enough to own all of its history.

(Via State Library and Archives of Florida)It’s the season of Thanksgiving: You know, the turkey before Christmas, the holiday with the Pilgrim hats, the football, and the frenzied online shopping.
But let us take a break from stuffing our faces and exhausting our credit cards and reflect on what we are grateful for here in Florida.
The Everglades!
Despite attacks on our River of Grass — over-use of fertilizer, runaway development, sea level rise, Burmese Pythons, and pollution from “Alligator Alcatraz” — that glorious ecosystem survives.
For now.
The Resistance!
Last month’s “No Kings” protests drew tens of thousands in more than 70 Florida cities and towns from Pensacola to Key West.
Florida may be as red as martyrs’ blood, but many of us aren’t big fans of authoritarianism or the new oligarchical class.
The (possible) return of the World’s Greatest Oyster!
After five years, the state will re-open Apalachicola Bay for two months, starting in January.
It’s only 500 acres out of 10,000, but a hopeful sign for our iconic bivalve.
Apalachicola once supplied 90% of oysters consumed in Florida, but over-harvesting, storms, and Georgia water-hogging have screwed up the special mix of fresh and saline needed to nurture the beds.

So much sunshine!
OK, it’s actually a drought, but let’s try to look on the bright side.
The Persistence of Great Journalism Against All Odds!
Public radio stations are laying off staff, newspapers are struggling, and local news is an endangered species.
As for social media, it’s a pit of vipers. Take a look at Grok, Elon Musk’s alleged answer to Wikipedia, a Hitler-praising, white supremacy-promoting, festival of misinformation.
Nevertheless, real reporters persist — and, as yet, none has been jailed.
Without the indefatigable reporting of Julie Brown (Miami Herald), the Jeffrey Epstein story may have faded away; in Guilty of Grief, Carol Marbin Miller (also of the Herald) showed how our fractured mental health system (and our cops) fail the vulnerable.
Michael Barfield of the Florida Trident last year exposed the rank hypocrisy of the morally elastic then-head of the Florida Republican Party and his Moms for Liberty co-founder wife in all their kinky glory.
The Tampa Bay Times now has no fewer than four environmental reporters watch-dogging water quality, endangered species, and developers’ determination to pave every inch of Florida.
We need to know about Big Phosphate depredations and why corals are dying.
We need the weekly columns by the Florida Phoenix’s own Craig Pittman, uncovering (among other things) the absurd plan to pay a big-time DeSantis campaign donor $80 million in taxpayer money to “conserve” four acres of environmentally insignificant land.
Universities are still educating!
Most of them, anyway.
Despite the sad destruction of New College and the assaults on the universities of Florida, West Florida, South Florida, and others, students continue to read, question, and ponder.
Gov. Ron DeSantis seems determined to wreck what was once quite a good state university system, clamping down on the study of race, gender, and history, hiring unqualified politicians as college presidents, and trying to inculcate conservatism through outfits like the UF’s Hamilton Center for Classical and Civics Education with its emphasis on American exceptionalism and Western Civilization.
DeSantis also wants to clamp down on those damned foreigners with their fancy degrees from Harvard and Oxford and the Sorbonne and their H1B visas, coming in to teach neuroscience, particle physics, and archaeology.
Yeah, who needs Nobel Prize-winners? But until the administration comes for them, professors will keep pushing students to search for real information (not the AI kind) and think for themselves.

George Clinton!
The Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Famer, Grammy Award-winner and intergalactic groover lives in Tallahassee.
He’s 85, still writing, still bringing the funk, still connecting with the Mothership.
Listen carefully and you’ll hear “Atomic Dog” floating on the wind.
Doctors who still believe in science!
According to KFF, a respected health policy foundation, Florida has one of the lowest rates of childhood immunization in the nation.
Hardly surprising, given that the state surgeon general says eating fruit is as good as getting a COVID booster, and kids don’t really need vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, Hepatitis B, diptheria, pertussis, polio, chicken pox, and other diseases that are not as fun as they sound.
Joseph Ladapo likens vaccine mandates to slavery (he clearly needs to read up on slavery) and wants them abolished.
But physicians and pharmacists who can distinguish peer-reviewed science from RFK Jr.-style nonsense strenuously resist this dangerous nonsense.
Go to CVS or Publix or your doctor’s office. Get the right jabs.
Dying of preventable disease is not cool.
Spring in North Florida!
Y’all south of the Suwannee might not know this, but up here we have four seasons. Sometimes the one we call “Fall” is only two days long, but the other three are pretty identifiable.
Come early February, the tulip trees are covered in perfumed blossoms, the daffodils and redbuds are out, and soon after the azaleas burst forth in pinks, whites, and magentas.
Hurricane season is over. (Probably). It’s cool, sometimes cold. If the pecan trees haven’t begun to bud, we’re still likely to have a freeze.
Come see it; you’ll like it.
Just don’t move here.
Writers!
Our retrograde politics and epic weirdness may not make for good social policy, but they are creative gold.
Despite — perhaps because of? — the government’s attempts to ban books that make them nervous, combined with a certain level of cultural backwardness, Florida is flush with extraordinary writers.
Judy Blume, author of “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret,” lives in Key West; Lauren Groff, three-time National Book Award finalist, is in Gainesville; Bob Shacochis, actual National Book Award-winner, spends half the year in Tallahassee; Carl Hiaasen is down in Vero Beach, where he continues to write books so outlandish he has to call them fiction, even though they’re based on genuine Florida surreality.
There are many, many more, including Stephen King, who’s transplanted himself to Sarasota, which is probably way scarier than Maine.
The food!
Key lime pie, grouper, smoked mullet, tupelo honey, pink shrimp, stone crabs, tres leches cake, conch fritters, Cuban sandwiches, Minorcan chowder, Plant City strawberries, mayhaw jelly, spiny lobster, boiled peanuts …
Christmas!
It’s almost here.
Actually, if you’ve been in a store of any kind, it’s already here: lights, trees, Santa, angels, elves, the whole damn circus.
But Christmas as most of us celebrate it, i.e. in December, is a rare few days in which the news might not splatter its psychic mess quite so relentlessly.
Turn off the screens. Go outside. Read a book.

Low taxes?
For people who own their own homes, that is.
Ron DeSantis likes to call us “The Free State of Florida.” While we’re not all that free (ask any teacher or renter or someone trying to afford health insurance or property insurance.) Her regards property taxes not as the contribution you make to fund the community you live in, but some kind of government theft.
To that end, he wants to abolish most of them.
He says we’ll keep the part that funds schools and cops, but as for those local government fripperies — parks, libraries, road maintenance, poverty programs, clinics, clean water — Free Floridians are on their own.
Expect your sales taxes to go up.
Even Republicans think this is nuts. Jeff Brandes, a former state senator, says, “It’s not really a proposal, it’s a bumper sticker, right?” and calls it “policy malpractice.”
2026 is coming!
Speaking of Ron DeSantis, he’s only got another year to smash things up around here.
That’s plenty of time to do more damage, but maybe the Legislature will finally understanding that the governor is increasingly irrelevant, probably politically finished, and ignore his tantrums.
Of course, he may be plotting another run for president.
But we should remember the Nation took a good look at him in 2024 and the Nation said, “Oh, hell no!”
For that, we can truly be truly thankful.

In 2022, Gov. Ned Lamont was reelected by a wide margin shortly after he and the legislature committed the state to a bold decarbonization pathway.
The science behind climate risks is stronger than ever, and there’s little reason to believe concern in Connecticut has waned. But the world around us has changed dramatically: our climate strategy was designed when there was strong momentum for global decarbonization that has since stalled. Because Connecticut’s efforts only matter in the context of a global response, we must ask whether our strategy fits today’s realities.

Noah Kaufman
A few years ago, optimism for global climate progress was high. President Joe Biden committed the country to ambitious targets, and Congress passed landmark legislation—most notably the Inflation Reduction Act— pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into clean energy. Other major economies were pushing forward as well: China stunned the world with its net-zero pledge, and the European Green Deal promised the first carbon-neutral continent.
Connecticut followed suit with a bold climate law of its own, including a mandate for 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2040. At the time, we were doing our “fair share” as part of a global coalition committed to climate leadership.
Today, that context looks different. Under President Trump, the U.S. is retreating from domestic decarbonization and actively undermining global efforts —including sabotaging an international pact on shipping emissions. In Europe, the war in Ukraine has shifted focus to energy security and affordability. China’s latest climate pledge merely codifies its business-as-usual trajectory. Instead of accelerating, global climate action is losing steam.
Connecticut faces its own headwinds. In 2021, regulators envisioned offshore wind supplying roughly half of the state’s electricity by 2040. Today, the offshore wind industry is struggling due to rising costs and the loss of federal support. More broadly, clean energy projects will be costlier for ratepayers due to the pullback of federal subsidies.
This doesn’t mean we should abandon our climate goals. But we should rethink our strategy. How should a small state like Connecticut, that is committed to climate progress, navigate a world that’s not moving in the same direction?
One option is to stay the course and strive to be a model. We teach our children to keep promises even when others don’t —shouldn’t we do the same? A small state can have global influence by becoming a success story that others can replicate.
Major changes would be needed to get there. Replacing the 60% of Connecticut’s electricity that comes from natural gas will require massive investments— not just in renewables and batteries but also in 24/7 generation like nuclear power. That would come with a steep price tag. Those costs may be worthwhile given the climate, health, and community benefits of clean energy.
However, few will look to Connecticut as a model if we simply stack large costs on top of an already expensive system. Our electricity rates are among the highest in the country, and nearly double those in Pennsylvania. Leading by example would require cutting costs while cutting emissions. 
I’ve authored a study that highlights some opportunities, including streamlining the permitting and interconnection processes for critical clean energy infrastructure; reducing the overlap between our cap-and-trade program, renewable portfolio standard, and state-led procurements; and completing the transition to performance-based regulation, aligning the incentives of utilities with our affordability and decarbonization goals.

Instead of sticking with existing targets, Connecticut could recalibrate its goals to better align with today’s economic and political realities. More gradual decarbonization could enable the state to postpone major investments —such as in offshore wind or new nuclear plants— until the costs of these technologies fall. We could reevaluate expensive rooftop solar subsidies, which pay about three times as much per kilowatt-hour as grid-scale solar. And we could consider investments in natural gas infrastructure —additional pipeline capacity could help relieve bottlenecks that drive up costs and emissions each winter.
Counterintuitive as it may seem, easing off aggressive climate targets could enable faster emissions reductions. More affordable energy helps to sustain support for climate policies and encourages more households to switch to electric cars and appliances.
Reasonable people will disagree on which of these two paths —or others— best reflects Connecticut’s values and constraints. The worst option is to press forward blindly until we hit a breaking point: ambitious targets, no credible way to meet them, and public frustration over rising energy bills.
Energy prices will be a key issue in next year’s governor’s election, just as they were in New Jersey this year. Connecticut needs an honest debate, and fresh thinking, to shape a strategy fit for today, not 2022. 
As economist John Maynard Keynes put it, “The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.”

Charlie Kirk should be alive because no one should be murdered for their opinions.
It doesn’t matter that Kirk told young men to expect submission from their wives, accused Jewish-Americans of funding “anti-white causes,” and argued that the Civil Rights Act was a “huge mistake.”
It doesn’t matter that he called transgender people “a throbbing middle finger to God,” believed that gay couples shouldn’t be allowed to adopt, and said “The Democrat Party supports everything that God hates”.
It doesn’t matter that he believed it’s “worth the cost” of gun violence to have an unlimited right to firearms, called vaccine mandates authoritarianism, and declared Joe Biden should be “given the death penalty.”
Charlie Kirk should be alive.
His legacy IS alive. As we condemn his murder, we must be honest about that legacy: an infrastructure centered around Turning Point USA that targets young people, and particularly young white men and boys, to push extreme ideology and conspiracy theories.  It is dangerous and feeds the roots of further political violence.
Being honest about this is important, because Charlie isn’t the only one who should still be alive, including:
Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman; murdered alongside her husband and dog in June by a man with a list of Democratic officials
Officer David Rose; a Marine Veteran and father of three who was killed in August during an attack on the CDC motivated by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories

The city is one of 16 jurisdictions in Maryland that do not have 287(g) agreements to work with ICE.(Photo courtesy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)With Maryland’s 2026 legislative session just a few months away, special interests are gearing up to introduce their proposals. Efforts to limit the reach of or to eliminate ICE 287(g) agreements, will find their way to the legislative inbox. These agreements allow local law enforcement to assist ICE in detaining for deportation individuals suspected of being undocumented.
Failure to pass the Maryland Values Act 287(g) provision during the 2025 legislative session, which aimed to terminate the 287(g) program throughout Maryland, raised significant concerns about immigration enforcement in the state. Touting crime prevention as a major factor, supporters like Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins, Maryland’s leading 287(g) advocate, with the longest running 287(g) agreement in the state, have misled the public.
Sheriff Jenkins has long championed the 287(g) agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, claiming it makes Frederick County safer and reduces crime. According to Jenkins, the program “works to keep our community more safe” and is “a very effective and invaluable public safety program.” However, a comparative analysis of 2024 crime data across three Maryland counties reveals a stark contradiction to these assertions, demonstrating that immigration enforcement programs bear no positive correlation with public safety outcomes.

In 2024, Frederick County achieved only a 4% overall crime reduction despite its active 287(g) program. While some property crimes decreased, the county experienced increases in aggravated assault, sex offenses, and weapons crimes. This mixed performance stands in contrast to Montgomery County, which achieved a 7% overall crime reduction, the best among the three counties examined, with decreases across violent and property crimes, including a 43% drop in carjackings and a 15% reduction in motor vehicle theft.
The comparison becomes even more revealing when considering immigrant populations. Montgomery County has the highest foreign-born population in Maryland at 32.8%, more than double Frederick County’s 12.9%. If Jenkins’ logic held true, that identifying and removing undocumented individuals enhances public safety, we would expect Montgomery County, with its substantially larger immigrant population and no 287(g) program, to fare worse in crime reduction. Instead, the opposite occurred. The county with the highest immigrant population achieved the greatest crime reduction success.
Prince George’s County further complicates Jenkins’ narrative. With a 24.5% foreign-born population and no 287(g) agreement, the county achieved significant reductions in serious crimes, including a 33% decrease in carjackings and a 5% reduction in homicides. Despite historically experiencing higher crime rates than its neighbors, Prince George’s County outperformed Frederick County in 2024 crime reduction efforts without resorting to immigration enforcement partnerships.
The fallacy in Jenkins’ reasoning lies in conflating immigration status with criminality, a correlation unsupported by evidence. Crime rates are influenced by complex socioeconomic factors including poverty levels, educational opportunities, employment rates, community policing strategies, and social services availability. Immigration status is not a meaningful predictor of criminal behavior, and immigration enforcement diverts resources from evidence-based public safety strategies.
Moreover, 287(g) programs can actually undermine public safety by creating fear within immigrant communities, making residents less likely to report crimes, cooperate with investigations, or serve as witnesses. When significant portions of a community fear interaction with law enforcement, actual criminals, regardless of immigration status, operate with greater impunity.
The data from these Maryland’s counties tells a clear story: Frederick County’s 287(g) program has not delivered superior public safety outcomes. Montgomery County’s success demonstrates that diverse, immigrant-inclusive communities can achieve excellent crime reduction results through traditional, community-oriented policing. Sheriff Jenkins’ claims about the 287(g) program’s effectiveness appear to be ideologically driven rather than evidence-based, reflecting a political position rather than a public safety reality. Effective crime reduction requires investments in proven strategies, community policing, social services, and economic opportunity, not immigration enforcement programs that statistics show make no positive difference in community safety.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54348554551_ce02f39035_o-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-11-24 07:58:23.423919

(Kathleen Flynn for ProPublica)After more than 25 years on death row, Jimmie Duncan inched one step closer to freedom Friday when Judge Alvin Sharp of the 4th Judicial District in Ouachita Parish granted him bail, setting it at $150,000. The decision comes nearly seven months after Sharp vacated Duncan’s 1998 first-degree murder conviction for killing his former girlfriend’s 23-month-old daughter, Haley Oliveaux, finding that it was based in part on bite mark evidence now considered by experts to be junk science.
The Ouachita Parish District Attorney’s Office has opposed Duncan’s release, arguing that Duncan is guilty of the murder. But in his bail ruling, Sharp pointed to evidence that the girl, who drowned, was at risk of seizure, meaning she could have died accidentally while in the tub. Sharp also noted the lack of blood or semen at the scene, contradicting the state’s position that Duncan raped Haley. And, he wrote in the ruling, there was a video, not presented at the trial, that Duncan’s legal team has alleged is evidence that — along with being based on debunked science — the bite-mark analysis in the case may have been fabricated.
The “presumption is not great” that Duncan is guilty, Sharp said.
“This ruling acknowledged the clear and convincing evidence showing that Mr. Duncan is factually innocent,” his attorneys said in a prepared statement. “Although Mr. Duncan’s ordeal is not over, today marks a significant step forward for Mr. Duncan’s complete exoneration.”
His attorneys said they’re working to get Duncan out of prison over the weekend.

This week’s ruling is yet another chapter in a nearly three-decade legal odyssey that has spotlighted Louisiana’s troubling history with wrongful convictions, as well as its long-held reputation as one of the country’s most punitive states.
As ProPublica and Verite News reported in March, Duncan’s conviction was based largely on now discredited bite mark evidence presented by forensic dentist Michael West and pathologist Dr. Steven Hayne, whose longtime partnership as state experts has been questioned following concerns about the validity of their techniques.
Over the past 27 years, nine prisoners have been set free after being convicted in part on inaccurate evidence given by West and Hayne. Three of those men were on death row. Duncan was the last person awaiting an execution based on the pair’s work.
Duncan, 56, has maintained his innocence since first being arrested in 1993 after Haley’s death. In the ensuing years, Haley’s mother, Allison Layton Statham, has come to support Duncan’s release. At Duncan’s first bail hearing in July, Statham testified that she believes Duncan to be innocent and demanded his release from prison.
Efforts to free Duncan have become even more urgent given the state’s recent moves, under conservative Gov. Jeff Landry, `to restart executions following a lapse of more than a decade.
Louisiana had not carried out a death sentence since 2010 as it has been unable to procure the drugs necessary for an execution. To overcome that obstacle, the state Legislature, at Landry’s urging, recently approved an alternative method: the use of nitrogen gas, a controversial method allowed in only three other states.
That opened the door to Louisiana’s first execution in 15 years. And on March 18, the state used nitrogen gas to put Jesse Hoffman Jr. to death.
To criminal justice reformers, Landry’s execution push is even more concerning given the state’s history in convicting and sentencing to death people later found to be innocent. In the past three decades, the state has exonerated 11 people facing execution, among the highest such numbers in the country, according to The National Registry of Exonerations.
Despite Sharp’s finding in April that Duncan is factually innocent, Ouachita prosecutors continue to insist that Duncan raped and murdered Oliveaux and should be executed without delay. The district attorney’s office, in urging Sharp to keep Duncan locked up, has argued that Duncan is “a safety risk to not only the victim’s family, but also the general public.” The office has appealed the decision to the Louisiana Supreme Court.
Duncan was arrested Dec. 18, 1993 after he reported finding Haley’s lifeless body floating in the tub of the home he shared with the girl’s mother in West Monroe. Duncan, who was babysitting that night, told authorities he had put the toddler in the tub to take a bath, then went downstairs to wash dishes. When he heard a noise coming from the bathroom, he rushed upstairs to check on her and found Haley floating face down in the water. She was pronounced dead a few hours later.
Prosecutors enlisted the assistance of Hayne, who had worked on hundreds of criminal cases in Mississippi and Louisiana over his decades-long career. Hayne conducted Haley’s medical exam and claimed he found evidence that she was sexually assaulted and intentionally drowned. He also claimed he found bite marks on her body.
Hayne’s frequent partner, Michael West, then analyzed the marks and found that they were a match for Duncan’s teeth. Based in part on those findings, Duncan was charged with first-degree murder. After about two weeks of testimony in 1998, the jury found Duncan guilty and sentenced him to death.


Let us know what you think...


 

Duncan’s post-conviction attorneys, however, later uncovered a trove of evidence which, they said, proves he is innocent and was wrongfully convicted, the most damning of which calls into question whether the bite marks Hayne said he found on Haley’s body were manufactured.
In a video of West’s 1993 examination of Haley — which was not shown to jurors at the trial — the dentist can be seen taking a mold of Duncan’s teeth and grinding it into the girl’s body. (West has previously said he was simply using what he called a “direct comparison” technique — in which he presses a mold of a person’s teeth directly onto the location of suspected bite marks.)
In his April ruling vacating Duncan’s conviction, Sharp said the work Hayne and West did on Duncan’s case was “no longer valid” and “not scientifically defensible.” Sharp also stated in his ruling that he found “very compelling” the September testimony of an expert medical witness who said that the child’s death was not the result of a homicide but of an accidental drowning. Prior to her death, Haley suffered several head injuries that could have caused seizures resulting in her drowning, according to the testimony.
Robert S. Tew, district attorney for Ouachita and Morehouse parishes, has argued that despite experts now dismissing bite mark evidence as “junk science,” it was an accepted methodology at the time of Duncan’s trial and that some experts still consider it to be valid. He has also noted that Hayne, who died in 2020, served as the pathologist for the district for over a decade and during that time “there has been no cases overturned because of Dr. Hayne’s autopsy.”
Tew’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
An initial bail hearing for Duncan held in July was delayed after prosecutors filed a motion to recuse Sharp, claiming he was biased given his earlier decision to set aside Duncan’s conviction. Sharp declined the request. In an October ruling, the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected the state’s appeal in a 6-1 vote. The court has yet to take up the state’s appeal of Sharp’s decision to set aside Duncan’s conviction.
As of publication time, it was not clear when Duncan may be released.

KILI-FM, the Porcupine, South Dakota-based tribal public broadcasting station Zephier manages, has gone digital and no longer needs the records.
The station is selling the records, because what it needs is cash.
That’s despite a last-minute deal brokered by South Dakota Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds to find funding for tribal stations when Congress voted in July to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

Like other public stations, KILI has typically been awarded money through the corporation.
“We were kind of planning for getting nothing, really, and that’s part of where the sale of the records came about,” Zephier said.
The July legislation, signed into law by President Donald Trump, rescinded $1.1 billion in federal funding for the corporation and caused it to wind down operations. South Dakota Public Broadcasting, which received 20% of its budget from the corporation, laid off seven people, eliminated a locally produced show and reduced the output of two other local shows.
Rounds’ handshake deal with the White House included a promise to provide $9.4 million for 38 tribal stations in highly rural areas, given the dearth of options for things like emergency alerts across remote swaths of tribal land. 
According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Indigenous Connectivity and Technology, award notices have gone out to KILI, as well as to KOYA in St. Francis, which serves the Rosebud Reservation, and KDKO in Lake Andes, serving the Yankton Sioux Reservation. A funding award is expected for KLND in McLaughlin, which offers programming for the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River reservations, according to a statement from the BIA.
In an email, Rounds told South Dakota Searchlight that future money can be requested on an annual basis, through the appropriations process instead of through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
“Our team continues to work with the administration to make certain these radio stations stay open and operational so they can continue to serve their communities for years to come,” Rounds said.
New process, old concerns
Earlier this month, speaking less than 24 hours after President Trump signed a bill to reopen the federal government after the longest shutdown in history, Zephier said he’s concerned about the reliability of annual awards from Congress.
“It’s a little more difficult,” Zephier said of the appropriations process. 
He took over at KILI after years working in administrative roles for the Oglala Sioux Tribe and area schools, which also rely on federal funding.
SD senator’s deal sparing tribes helps advance bill stripping funds from NPR, PBS, foreign aid

Consternation over inadequate federal funding is a regular throughline for tribal nations in South Dakota. The Oglala Sioux Tribe has thrice sued the Interior Department over law enforcement funding, most recently last month. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe won a case against the Indian Health Service after the agency closed the reservation’s only emergency room. 
Zephier said the station’s BIA award funding could come as soon as this week. It matches the funding the station got through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal year 2025, which ended Sept. 30.
The $235,000 won’t solve the station’s long-term funding problems, though. It covers about 70% of the station’s $350,000 annual budget, the rest of which the station raises by underwriting and collecting fees from tribal programs that lease time for programming.
It’s enough to get by, as long as nothing goes wrong.
Zephier pointed to the station’s wind turbine, a three-blade machine with two functional blades, and to its solar panels, some of which are cracked and in need of repair. Both systems help power the station, located on a stretch of highway outside the village of Porcupine.
One of the station’s two computers is new, or at least new to Zephier. It’s a 2017 system, which he bought because fixing the 12-year-old computer he’d been using would’ve cost more than the replacement.
“We need new equipment,” Zephier said. “We need a new emergency alert system, and that’s going to cost us about $170,000 alone.”
This year, future years
KILI was featured in a New York Times story that highlighted how important tribal stations are in their communities. Zephier grew up hearing Lakota speakers and powwow music on KILI, and it’s one of the area’s primary sources of information on tribal government, schools and community events. 
KILI has raised $80,000 in donations since the summer, and $50,000 came from a single donor after the story ran in the Times.

KOYA radio’s station in St. Francis, South Dakota. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)

John Miller, the longtime manager of KOYA in St. Francis, spoke to South Dakota Searchlight moments before a meeting about a middle school sports broadcast.
Miller got notice that KOYA would get federal funding for the current fiscal year a few months ago. He declined to say how much funding came through for the station, but did say “everything” it does is covered by federal dollars.
“We were one of the lucky ones,” Miller said, in that KOYA got its funding assurances before the government shutdown, which lasted from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.
Not all stations have gotten notice of federal funding, according to a BIA spokesperson. In an email to South Dakota Searchlight, the agency declined to offer the dollar amounts awarded to individual stations. Previously, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting made a list of its awards publicly available. 
The BIA said it is “working to accelerate the implementation of one-time funding to support 38 radio stations and one television station that provide emergency public safety information to tribal communities.”
The money for tribal public broadcasting came from “previously appropriated federal funds” to “support tribal communications infrastructure,” the agency said.
The email did not address questions about funding beyond 2025.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PXL_20251113_220212973-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-11-23 11:58:32.835079

Bill Sutton, R-Gardner, says during a Nov. 23, 2025, forum in Overland Park that religious faith drives his opposition to capital punishment and to support legislation replacing it with sentences requiring life in prison without a chance for parole. The forum was  hosted by the Kansas Coalition Against the Death Penalty. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)OVERLAND PARK — Rep. Bill Sutton’s opposition to the death penalty was conceived through Catholic faith, magnified by conservative wariness of government and molded into a cause during more than a decade of service to the Kansas House.
Sutton, a Gardner Republican representing a district spread across southern Johnson and Douglas counties, endorsed all five bills introduced in the Legislature since 2017 to repeal capital punishment in Kansas.
During a Saturday forum organized by the Kansas Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Sutton echoed the belief of other panelists that retention of the death penalty in Kansas was inconsistent with “pro-life” ideals. There was an unacceptable risk the government could put to death innocent people, he said. And, he said, the status quo forced taxpayers to swallow the exorbitant cost of trials and appeals in capital murder cases.
“You don’t have to be a bleeding heart to hate the death penalty. This thing has flaws all over the place,” Sutton said. “I have absolutely zero qualms about being against the death penalty. It’s illogical. It’s expensive. It’s inconsistent with my beliefs.”
From 1973 to 2024, courts in the United States exonerated 200 people who had previously been sentenced to death. Nationally, about 2,100 men and women remain incarcerated on death sentences. Forty-four people have been executed in this country during 2025.
Kansas hasn’t executed anyone since 1965. Capital punishment was banned in Kansas from 1972 to 1994. While 15 men have been sentenced to death in this state since 1994, only nine await execution by lethal injection. The state hasn’t had a death row exoneration in Kansas, but since the state reimposed capital punishment two of the 15 died of old age and four were resentenced to life after plea negotiations during the appellate process.
For an audience at Johnson County Community College that included Republican and Democratic state legislators, Sutton said the Catholic Church instilled in him a belief that all life was sacred. This piece of religious instruction most often is expressed by politicians when debating whether the state should end access to abortion, he said. But, he added, politicians had a tendency to justify the punishment of death by placing a qualifier on their pro-life view.
“I treat life as sacred. That means when it’s young and cute and cuddly. Absolutely. That means when it’s old. Sure. That means when it is ugly and sick. Yeah. And, that means when it does tremendously heinous things,” he said.
 
 
‘Treated with dignity’
Death penalty opponents who took part in the forum included Nan Tolson, director of Texas Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty, and Krisanne Vaillancourt Murphy, executive director of the Catholic Mobilizing Network.
Tolson, who worked for Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, said the Texas organization dedicated to ending capital punishment was founded in 2013. It has granted political and social conservatives a safe place to consider how the death penalty intersected with their principles and values, she said.
“More and more conservatives are recognizing that the death penalty is incompatible with pro-life values,” she said. “We have a moral obligation to respect all life, whether innocent or guilty.”
She said the death penalty was regrettably viewed as a liberal or progressive issue, but it was folly to put a partisan label on a topic everyone should care about deeply. She said, so far, 17 death penalty exonerations had occurred in Texas.
“Those are the just the ones that we have caught, and there’s strong evidence that many states have actually executed people that were innocent,” Tolson said.
She said defenders of capital punishment argued removal of the ultimate penalty undermined law enforcement. In response, she said, death penalty critics should insist that abolition of the death penalty was a tough-on-crime position.
“Lean into that messaging a little bit and say, ‘We’re so proud to be tough on crime that we’re willing to look critically at our justice system and be able to recognize when things are working and when things are not,’ ” Tolson said.
Murphy, executive director of the national Catholic organization working to dismantle capital punishment, said the reform process required education, advocacy and prayer. The goal should be to replace sentences of death with restorative justice that brought healing to perpetrators and victims, she said.
“We believe that, no matter the harm someone has caused or suffered, they deserve to be treated with dignity,” Murphy said. “Core to our faith understanding is that God has bestowed a sacred dignity on each and every person.”
She said surveys of Catholics revealed that young adults in their 20s were more likely to be consistent in application of a “life ethic” and that could help move America away from capital punishment.
“I think they are the generation that’s going to help end the death penalty,” she said.
 
Budget ‘black hole’
The closest Kansas came in the past 15 years to repeal of capital punishment was a 20-20 vote in the Kansas Senate in 2010. Senators deadlocked on a bill that would have replaced death sentences with life in prison without a chance at parole.
Donna Schneweis, chair of the Kansas Coalition Against the Death Penalty, said bills in the Senate and House introduced during 2025 would remain in play during the 2026 session. House Bill 2272 and Senate Bill 245 would abolish the death penalty for crimes committed after July 1, 2025. The capital murder statute would be replaced by a new crime of aggravated murder, which would have a sentence of imprisonment for life without parole.
However, Schneweis said, neither the House nor Senate judiciary committees held hearings on the legislation during the the 2025 session.
Sutton said members of the Legislature should consider issues beyond personal faith. He said application of capital punishment created a “fiscal black hole,” because a Kansas death penalty case might cost three to four times more than a typical murder case.
The Kansas State Board of Indigents’ Defense Services estimated the potential savings of not handling new death-penalty-eligible cases could reach $5 million annually.
“From a fiscal standpoint, this thing is a nonstarter,” Sutton said. “We spend money. We achieve absolutely nothing.”
He also fretted about the enormous power entrusted to district and county attorneys to fairly make use of death penalty statutes. He said prosecutors were filing capital charges to entice defendants to take guilty pleas in a quest to save time and money.
“Justice should be steering this process, not leverage. The death penalty is leverage for the justice system. And that’s backward,” Sutton said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bill-Sutton-death-penalty-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-23 10:58:58.051558

(Photo by Amanda Brown/New Jersey Monitor)EAST RUTHERFORD — Gov. Phil Murphy and first lady Tammy Murphy are no strangers to the yearly proceedings of the New Jersey Hall of Fame.
But this year they helped open the hall’s 17th induction ceremony with a tribute to someone close to them — Sheila Y. Oliver. 
The late lieutenant governor, who died in 2023 during her second term, was the first Black woman to hold the office and the second person to fill the position in state history. Oliver, 71, was also the first woman of color in an elected statewide post. 
At Friday night’s ceremony, Tammy Murphy called Oliver, a member of the hall’s 2025 class, a “true New Jersey legend” over the competing din of mall traffic outside the ceremony, the first held in the hall’s new home, the American Dream complex. 
As the Ferris wheel turned above a windowed ceiling, the three-hour feting of state greats allowed Gov. Murphy to break out one of his favorite refrains: “Jersey, baby!” 
The festivities took place not far from the year-old New Jersey Hall of Fame Entertainment & Learning Center at The Rink, the sprawling retail compound’s ice rink, covered for the occasion.
Tahesha Way, the current lieutenant governor, also helped to open the night’s events, hosted by hall of fame regular Danny DeVito, pride of Asbury Park. 
Oliver, who grew up in Newark, was a longtime resident of East Orange, where she was once president of the board of education. Before being elected lieutenant governor in 2017, she was the first Black woman to serve as speaker of the state Assembly from 2010 to 2014. She also served as the commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs. 
“If Sheila Oliver had a seat at the table, that meant we all had a seat at the table,” said Renee Oliver, Oliver’s niece, who accepted the honor.
Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill was among the speakers at Friday’s ceremony, one of the few voices to successfully cut through the mall soundtrack and low microphone volume problems to reach the seats in the back. Sherrill, who will be the state’s second woman governor and first who is a Democrat, made a point of it. 
The former congresswoman and Navy helicopter pilot remembered the sentiment of a shirt a roommate once gave her: “I’m not yelling, I’m from New Jersey.”
Matching her spirited delivery was another practiced speaker, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, who inducted Dorothea Bongiovi, wife of fellow state hall of famer Jon Bon Jovi. The recipient of the hall’s Unsung Hero honor is the founder of JBJ Soul Kitchen, the nonprofit community restaurant. 
Booker praised Bongiovi’s “profound moral imagination” and “innovative brilliance.” 
Bon Jovi himself made an appearance to induct his bandmate David Bryan, the keyboardist for Bon Jovi. He’s known Bryan, who grew up in Edison, since the 1970s. As high school kids, they played with the band Atlantic City Expressway, back when they’d have to split $150 gig payments between the 10 members of the group. 
“Tonight is a celebration of opportunity. And New Jersey is the place for opportunity, and it all starts in the mall,” Bryan said, looking around the venue and harking back to his days growing up near Menlo Park Mall. “No matter where you grow up in New Jersey, you’re always 15, 20 minutes from a mall.” 
Before the rise of Bon Jovi, he went to Rutgers on a track to become a doctor and trained at Juilliard. Later, he became a two-time Tony winner for the musical “Memphis.” 
Westfield resident Johnny Rzeznik, lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls, performed the 1986 Bon Jovi song “Wanted Dead or Alive.” 
Jake Bongiovi, Jon and Dorothea’s son, and his wife, “Stranger Things” star Millie Bobby Brown, were offstage for all the Bon Jovi family love.
The induction of the Jonas Brothers served as the night’s finale. Kevin, Joe, and Nick Jonas, who are getting ready to wind down their 20th anniversary Greetings From Your Hometown tour next month, didn’t sing, but they did sing the praises of their home state. Growing up in Wyckoff and later moving to Little Falls, the Jersey trio shot to fame in the 2000s. 
“There’s just something in the water here in Jersey, am I right?” Nick Jonas said, paying homage to “New Jersey grit.” 
Kevin Jonas praised Jersey for being the home where he found the love of his life, Danielle Jonas. Joe Jonas remembered a childhood riding bikes until the streetlights came on, arguing over the last chicken cutlet, and thinking of mall food court options as high dining. 
In other highlights, Edie Falco, aka Carmela Soprano, showed up to induct CNN host Dana Bash. 
“I love telling people that I’m from New Jersey,” said Bash, who grew up in Montvale and is an alum of Pascack Hills High School.
She reminisced about going to Dairy Queen on Chestnut Ridge Road and ordering cheese fries at the Ridge Diner.
“I know you all want to know, so the exit is 172,” she said.

The Wake Forest Demon Deacons defeated the University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens, 52-14, Saturday, November 22. The Blue Hens end the regular season with a 1-5 record on the road. 
 
Nick Minicucci and the University of Delaware offense moved the ball well as they operated within the two minute timeout. The Blue Hens trailed by three scores as the game neared halftime. Starting on the Demon Deacons’ 20-yard line, Minicucci connected with receiver Sean Wilson near the left sideline.
Wilson caught the pass and turned to run upfield, but as he made his move the ball fell from his hands. The ball bounced off cleats and shins before Wake Forest recovered the ball at its own 21-yard line. On the ensuing play, redshirt senior quarterback Robby Ashford launched a deep pass to junior Carlos Hernandez that was caught and taken 79 yards for a Demon Deacon score.
The quick score left UD with a 28 point deficit at halftime that it couldn’t overcome. The Demon Deacons defeated the Blue Hens, 52-14, in Delaware’s final road game of the season. The Blue Hens only won one game on the road this season. 
UD’s lone road win this season came in its first conference game against FIU back in late September. Since then, Delaware is 0-4 as the traveling team scoring less than 30 points in all but one of those games.
UD’s offense faced similar road struggles against Wake Forest’s 24th ranked defense in yards allowed per game in the country.  
The Blue Hens’ offense accumulated 35 total yards in the first quarter and only registered two first downs in the first 15 minutes. Delaware earned its first score of the game on a pass to sophomore running back Viron Ellison Jr. stepping in as the starter with senior Jo Silver out for the game. Ellison’s 43-yard catch and run down the left sideline cut the Demon Deacons’ two score lead down to one early in the second quarter. 
Wake Forest’s offense started strong by scoring on its first five offensive possessions. Running backs Demond Claiborne and Ty Clark III ran the ball into the endzone on Wake Forest’s two first quarter possessions. Connor Calvert converted on two field goals and Ashford ran in his first touchdown of the afternoon in the second quarter, before Ashford and Hernandez connected on their big play before halftime.
The Demon Deacons carried that momentum over to the third quarter scoring touchdowns on both of their third quarter drives. By the time the fourth quarter began, UD trailed by 42 points. 
Minicucci and other starters for both teams gave way to backups in the fourth quarter. Sophomore quarterback Braden Streeter threw his first touchdown pass of the season in the final frame giving UD one last score before the game ended. 
The Blue Hens finished the game with 300 total yards of offense. Ellison Jr. led the team in both rushing and receiving amassing 94 total yards on 16 touches. The Demon Deacons finished with a season high 577 total yards of offense along with a season high 52 points. Hernandez finished with 197 receiving yards and a Wake Forest record 93-yard touchdown catch.
The loss is Delaware’s sixth this season and second to a Power Four school — an opponent from the Big Ten, ACC, Big 12 or SEC conferences — in its first FBS season. In their road games against power four foes Colorado and Wake Forest, the Blue Hens scored a combined 21 points and allowed 83. 
The Blue Hens return home for senior night Saturday, November 29, in their final game as a first time FBS school.

(Photo by Jeanette DeDios/KUNM-FM)Members of the New Mexico congressional delegation and Pueblo leaders held a press conference at the All Indian Pueblo Cultural Center on Friday to urge Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to visit Chaco Culture National Historical Park and continue protecting it from oil and gas drilling.
In October, the Bureau of Land Management began a process to revoke protections for 10 miles around the national parks to allow for possible oil and gas exploration.
This comes after the New Mexico congressional delegation and Pueblo governors held a press conference in front of the U.S. Capitol in September to demand that the Trump administration protect Chaco Canyon.
New Mexico tribal leaders push to protect Chaco

Chaco has massive buildings constructed over a thousand years ago by ancestral Pueblo people, with roads leading to other far-flung settlements.
Craig Quanchello, governor of the Picuris Pueblo and vice chairman of the All Pueblo Council of Governors, spoke on the cultural significance of Chaco.
“Our ancestors lived there, prayed there, studied the stars there, and carried teachings outward into our modern Pueblo communities,” he said. “Our ties to Chaco live in, our songs, our ceremonies, our pilgrimages and our ancient roads and shrines that stretch far beyond the park itself.”
U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján were in attendance alongside U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury.
Stansbury said during the federal shutdown, tribal leaders were unable to reach the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but did receive a letter from the Trump Administration informing them that they had two weeks to respond to Chaco being taken out of federal protection.
“Can you imagine the cruelty, the insensitivity, the stupidity of an administration contacting tribal leaders as they are trying to figure out how they are going to feed their people and balance their budgets and keep their public safety in order to tell them that they are going to take away their most sacred lands and open it up for private oil and gas drilling?” she said.
Quanchello said that this issue affects everyone.
“This is not only a Pueblo issue, it’s an American issue about history, heritage and a landscape recognized around the world,” he said.
Congressional and Pueblo leaders invited Burgum to visit Chaco and to have a meaningful talk with them.

The Snow
Harper Goddard, 14, Chester
A fresh white blanket covers the hill.
I press my palms down into the layers.
Flakes fall onto my face.
They melt fast, but the feeling stays,
that numbness that soaks the apples of my cheeks.
I take off my mittens.
The pain is worth it.
The cold overrules all.
Maybe if I lie here long enough, it will swallow me whole. 
My hair turns into damp, tangled strands of amber.
My eyelashes are no longer light brown, but white.
My nose is pink, nearly sunburnt.
There’s a silence that comes with the snow,
a peace of some sort.
I’ve never known a world like this –
a tranquil world,
a worry-free world.
A world where only your breathing is heard.
It almost feels like a dream.
My heart beats quickly inside my chest.
Not in fear;
I know fear well.
It’s a different feeling.
The pond smooths over with a thick layer of ice.
The water now looks as though it’s running clean.
The plow scrapes loudly against the asphalt patch of our driveway.
The driver is inconsistent in his schedule, driving my mother mad each morning he doesn’t show.
How did I go from Santa Ana winds to this?
The universe works in mysterious ways…
Nearly everyone within our little town groans at the sight of the tiny specks falling to the ground.
“I hate winter,” they all say.
I think it’s a gift. But I’ll never tell them that.

Cancer shouldn’t be harder to fight just because you live in a small, rural community. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Randall Holcombe: The Vermont cancer care model, a rural cancer care revolution.","This commentary is by Randall Holcombe, M.D., of Burlington. He is the associate dean for cancer programs at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine and director of the UVM Cancer Center, Vermont’s only not-for-profit comprehensive clinical and research cancer center. 


At a recent appointment, one of my patients asked me, “How long are you staying around?”
It wasn’t a casual question. In rural Vermont, folks have seen their share of “locums” — short-term doctors who come for a few weeks or months and then move on. For cancer patients, that revolving door can feel unsettling and leads to fragmented, poorly coordinated care. They want to know the person caring for them will be there for the long haul.
The truth is, recruiting oncologists to rural areas has always been difficult, and across the country the number of cancer doctors hasn’t kept pace with demand. A major study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology from 2007 predicted that demand for oncologists would increase by 48% by 2020. From 2015 to 2022, the number of medical oncologists grew by only 14.5%. This gap hits rural communities hardest.
And here’s the tough reality: nationwide, rural patients are more likely to die from cancer than those in cities. That’s not acceptable. At the UVM Cancer Center, our mission is to reduce the burden of cancer for everyone in Vermont and northern New York. That means making sure people in every corner of our catchment area, especially those in rural communities, have access to expert, academic-level cancer care.
So, what are we doing about it? 
First, we’re planting seeds for a stronger oncology workforce.  One big step we took this year is expanding our hematology and oncology fellowship program to include rotations in rural practices. We hope that by training fellows in rural settings they might one day establish or join an oncology practice in a rural community.
Also, this year we launched our BioMobile Laboratory program — a lab on wheels in our Cancer Center van that will be traveling to rural high schools around the state. By giving students an up-close look at cool cancer science and research, we hope to inspire them to become the next generation of doctors and scientists in Vermont. 
Our van is also traversing the state to bring community skin checks, HPV vaccination clinics  and educational programs that encourage colon cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer screening. We know that today’s efforts will reap long term benefits, when fewer of our family members and neighbors get diagnosed with advanced stage cancers. 
And, starting next year, the UVM Cancer Center will lay the foundation for a statewide collaborative network that connects academic cancer experts at the UVM Cancer Center with primary care practices. We call it the “Vermont Cancer Care Model,” and it’s designed to improve cancer outcomes for rural patients while supporting a community of providers, leading to lower rates of physician burnout and a more stable healthcare workforce.
Under this system, rural providers can consult with disease-specific experts about how to help patients manage cancer treatment side effects. Meanwhile, rural cancer patients will receive as much of their care as possible close to home, which reduces costs and eliminates unnecessary travel. This system may even allow patients to participate in cutting-edge clinical trials run by the UVM Cancer Center, which today are only available if patients travel to Burlington or Berlin.  
At the UVM Cancer Center, we are starting this work today, and we believe our efforts will improve the quality of care, reduce the burden of cancer on patients, and lower overall health care costs.
It’s true that big ideas and building a new infrastructure require investment — but don’t Vermonters deserve this? Cancer shouldn’t be harder to fight just because you live in a small, rural community. It’s time to change that and make Vermont a model for rural cancer care nationwide.
When my patient asked if I was staying, I told them, “I’m here to stay.” Their smile said it all. But wouldn’t it be something if, one day, no patient ever had to ask that question again?

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-23 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Supreme Court could strike down a rare Mississippi effort to improve voter access,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/23/mississippi-voter-access-supreme-court/,Republican groups are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that a law passed by a GOP-led Mississippi Legislature is unconstitutional. The law is a rare example of Mississippi improving voter access.,"Seldom in the history of the state has the Legislature passed laws, without being forced to by the federal courts, to make it easier for Mississippians to vote.
As COVID-19 spread in 2020, Mississippi legislators and election officials were criticized by national groups because of their nominal efforts to accommodate voters during the deadly pandemic. In the midst of the health scare, Mississippi legislators took one step to improve voter access.
Granted, it was a small step, but by Mississippi standards perhaps a landmark event. The Legislature amended state law to allow mail-in ballots to be counted if they arrived in the circuit clerk’s office within five days after Election Day.
Republican groups are now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that a law passed by the Republican-dominated Mississippi Legislature is unconstitutional.

Never mind that Mississippi is one of only three states in the nation that does not allow some form of no-excuse early voting – in person, by mail or both. Never mind that many of the people who are allowed to vote by mail – if they have an excuse – must have two election documents signed in front of a notary public to do so. In many cases, the mail-in ballot request must be notarized and then the envelope that is used to return the ballot via mail also must be notarized.
So, in 2020, the small step of providing some protection to ensure mail-in ballots would be counted even if there was a postal office snafu was celebrated.
And it seems a bit perplexing that the Republican National Committee would challenge the five-day rule in Mississippi since many other states – 14 – had similar laws and in some cases have had the laws for some time. Even more states – 29 – allow military and overseas ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to be counted after Election Day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. It is not clear what a Supreme Court ruling striking down the Mississippi law would do to the overseas and military ballots.
Most believe that if the law is found unconstitutional in Mississippi, it would mean the other states that allow mail ballots to be counted after Election Day – as long as they are postmarked on or before that day – also would be null and void.
Such a change could be important in a so-called swing state where the elections are often close and a few thousand late-arriving ballots could make a difference in determining the next president.
But the only problem with that thinking is that most of the states that allow late-arriving ballots to be counted are not swing states. Some are blue states while others are red. Nevada is perhaps the only swing state that allows late-arriving ballots to be counted if they arrive after Election Day, excluding the additional states that allow late-arriving military and overseas ballots to be counted.
The Mississippi five-day rule has a certain symmetry. After all, people who try to vote without the required government-issued photo identification have five days after the election to prove they are who they say they are. So, it makes a certain amount of logic to allow election officials to also count late-arriving ballots for five days as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.
Plus, the five-day rule must help a little for people voting by mail who must get two documents notarized.
Various groups have routinely listed Mississippi at the top or near the top in terms of the most restrictive states to vote.
Now, will the nation’s highest court rule that one of the state’s few efforts to improve access is unconstitutional?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04110931/3X0A1890.jpg,,,2025-11-23 07:56:16.193046

The state’s largest ski area hopes to welcome back the international racing circuit’s annual Thanksgiving weekend competition in 2026 —potentially on an every-other-year schedule.

KILLINGTON — Killington Resort, on hiatus from hosting World Cup ski racing as it completes $60 million in improvements, is aiming to welcome back the circuit’s Thanksgiving weekend competition in 2026.
The one caveat: The state’s largest ski area and its new independent owners are talking about limiting their future participation to every other year due to the international event’s $2 million annual cost.
“It’s an expensive operation,” Phill Gross, a lead Killington investor and private capital manager, said at a recent community meeting. “It takes cash flow away from the development of the mountain, as good as it is for the brand.”
Since its Vermont debut in 2016, the World Cup annually draws up to 20,000 spectators and a national television audience of 2 million viewers for Alpine women’s races on the Saturday and Sunday after Thanksgiving.
When local investors formed the Killington Independence Group to buy the ski area last year, they announced $38 million in upgrades — starting with a new $12 million Superstar trail chairlift whose construction required this month’s competition to relocate to Copper Mountain in Colorado.
Killington leaders now are floating the idea of taking turns hosting the World Cup with the western ski area. 
“We’re hoping that we can do an every-other-year contract,” Gross said, “but that’s to be determined.”

As for other plans, the new owners just announced an additional $22 million in infrastructure work as they raise the capacity and reduce the energy consumption of the resort’s 9-million-gallon-a-day snowmaking system.
“Part of being independent that’s really been great for us is just being nimble and quick,” Killington CEO Mike Solimano said at the community meeting. “Say we have savings in one capital project, we can quickly decide to implement another one.”
The development comes seven decades after a 20-something visiting honeymooner named Preston Smith raised $30,000 for a simple shelter and parking lot and opened Killington’s first trails in 1958. 
Smith, now 95, went on to create the biggest snow-sport resort in eastern North America. It was sold to the Maine-based American Skiing Company in 1996 (the same year neighboring Pico Mountain joined its portfolio), then to the Utah-based Powdr Corp. in 2007 and finally to the Killington Independence Group last year.
The latest plans call for upgrading the resort’s more than 20 chairlifts over multiple years to ensure access to all 92 miles of terrain, even during snowstorms.
In a related but separate action, Canada’s Great Gulf real estate group — another lead Killington investor — is continuing to seek permits for a 450-acre retail and residential slopeside village. Developers unveiled plans two years ago with hopes of starting construction as soon as 2026, but design changes and ongoing study by local and state review boards have sparked delays.
“I would say there’s a ton going on, but not a ton I can really report on,” Solimano said of the status of the village development process.
Killington was the first eastern U.S. resort to open this ski season, launching Nov. 12 with a record amount of snow-covered terrain. The new owners anticipate a busy Thanksgiving week, even without international racing.
“I think as much as everyone loves the World Cup, others are going to be thinking, ‘I really like having all these trails open,’” Solimano said.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 18, 2025.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — Parking changes are on the horizon in three Upper Valley communities. After much debate, meters are scheduled to be installed in downtown White River Junction in the coming weeks. Elsewhere, a Hanover parking garage was slated to reopen this week and Woodstock has approved a new parking ordinance.
The 16 new kiosks in White River Junction will regulate 211 parking spaces, including on-street parking and spaces in the town square parking lot across from the Hotel Coolidge. It will remain free to park in the South Main Street lot near the VFW building all day.
Parking will cost $1 an hour and can be paid for in 15-minute increments for up to two hours. The kiosks will accept cash and cards, and connect to a mobile phone app. The system, from San Diego-based IPS Group, is the same one that is online in Hanover.
The goal of the meters is “not so much about the revenue as about making sure that people are in compliance” with an existing two-hour parking limit in most downtown spots, Planning and Development Director Lori Hirshfield said.
Whether to install parking meters has been a point of contention in Hartford for years. The Selectboard came under fire last fall when its members unanimously opted to use $145,000 in leftover COVID-19 aid to purchase the kiosks.
The decision was unpopular with many residents who saw their votes against using $160,000 of local option tax revenue to purchase meters in 2020 as a rejection of parking meters altogether. The town ballot measure was defeated handily by a margin of 2,088-906.
After public outcry, the Selectboard briefly delayed its vote on the parking ordinance that would implement meters before opting to approve the policy at a July 14 meeting with the goal of increasing turnover in downtown White River Junction which is often strapped for parking to access downtown businesses.
Exactly when the meters will be installed is not yet clear, but once contractors start the work it will take three to four days to get the kiosks installed, Hirshfield said.
Once the meters are installed they won’t be turned on right away, Hirshfield said. Town staff will have to test the machines to make sure everything is running smoothly, install signage around town with parking information and hire staff to enforce the meters, Hirshfield said. They also want to give residents time to get used to the new system.
The revenues are expected to cover the cost of an enforcement officer within the Hartford Police Department. Hiring for that role is still ongoing.
Hanover parking garage to reopen
In Hanover, the municipal parking garage that has been closed to the public for renovations since mid-September is scheduled to partially reopen Wednesday, according to an announcement from the town.
Work included concrete repairs, updates to emergency lights and the structure’s carbon monoxide monitoring system and other structural work.
Along with the reopening, the Hanover Selectboard opted at a Monday night meeting to introduce new parking rates in the garage for a three-month trial period starting Wednesday.
The new rates will include one hour of free parking, an increase from the previous 15-minute limit, and charge by the hour instead of by 15-minute increments. Rates range from $3 for one to two hours to $20 for the day.
With the changes, the town aims to “streamline” parking garage operations and “simplify the fee structure,” Town Manager Robert Houseman said in a recording of the meeting. During the three months, town staff will monitor garage usage, revenues and customer feedback to make long-term adjustments to parking in downtown Hanover.
Woodstock trustees adopt new parking ordinance
In Woodstock, the Board of Village Trustees unanimously adopted a new parking ordinance last week that is set to take effect in January. The ordinance, which has been in the works since the start of the year, makes several changes to village parking. These include raising fines for parking at an unpaid or expired meter from $10 to $15.
Parking fees also will be charged from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday, one hour less than previously. The new ordinance also adjusts parking regulations around the village, including designating Ford Street, Stanton Street and Charles Street as new no parking zones.
The ordinance has been in the works since January when Trustee Lisa Lawlor started looking at ways to increase revenues in the Village that are not contingent on taxes. Lawlor found that the previous fines for not feeding the meter are lower than other towns that are either similar or nearby to Woodstock.
The change in fines was a good opportunity to look at the existing ordinance and focus on making it “easier to understand for everyone,” Woodstock Municipal Manager Eric Duffy said at the time.
The town was successful in that effort, Lawlor said.
“We clarified; we did everything we could to make the language more straightforward,” she said at the Nov. 10 meeting.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Republican primary race for Nebraska governor is already heating up, and it might soon get serious. 
Trump donor and multi-state agribusinessman Charles Herbster has made more pointed statements about Gov. Jim Pillen in recent weeks on social media.  
Herbster’s posts have shifted in tone from talking about national politics and President Donald Trump, with some references to state politics, to more direct criticism of Pillen as he continues mulling a 2026 rematch bid for governor.
Starting this month, Herbster has criticized Pillen for not listening to the business community, for not selling the state aggressively enough to business leaders elsewhere and for resisting voter-approved medical cannabis, the legalization of which Herbster now says should be respected. 
“Our governor should be the state’s leading salesman,” Herbster wrote one post. “To say we should not focus on attracting new businesses is beyond reckless — it is not leadership.”

In another social media post, Herbster said, “Governor Jim Pillen has done everything he can to delay and dismantle the voter-enacted medical cannabis statutes.”
Herbster also has started reviving his 2022 campaign staple of saying he wants to “Make Nebraska Great Again” and sounds more and more like someone running for governor. 
Asked this week whether his statements should be read as telegraphing a 2026 bid, he told the Examiner, “Governor Pillen’s shortcomings make it hard to say no.” Herbster said his decision on whether to run would come closer to the new year. 
“We are not on a path to success,” Herbster said. “Our governor seems stubbornly convinced he alone has all the answers and continues to double down on failure. He can tout some social-issue wins — which I wholeheartedly support — but Nebraskans are worried about the economy.”
If Herbster gets in, 2026 would be a rematch between the two candidates who received the most votes in the 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary. That race included former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who is now running for the open seat in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Lindstrom finished third in that 2022 GOP primary.

Pillen cruised to general election victory against then-Democratic State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue. 
That 2022 contest was one of the most expensive gubernatorial races in Nebraska history, with $29 million flowing into it. Herbster largely self-funded his campaign, while Pillen raised large sums and also benefitted from outside help by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts.
Herbster during that 2022 primary earned the endorsement of President Donald Trump, while Pillen was backed by Ricketts. Pillen appointed Ricketts to the U.S. Senate shortly after becoming governor. Ricketts, R-Neb., won a special election in November to serve out the final two years of former GOP U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse’s term. Ricketts is currently in a heated race against former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn, a registered nonpartisan. 
Herbster spent weeks of that campaign denying the allegations of eight women who alleged in a 2022 Nebraska Examiner article that Herbster had groped them. All eight accounts were corroborated either by witnesses or people the women told what happened immediately afterward. But the reasons for his loss were more complex than the national political narrative.

Several GOP operatives have expected Pillen to draw at least one primary challenger, partly because of national and local polling numbers that indicate he could be vulnerable. Among the criticisms they and others have said he is likely to face are about increased state spending, the effectiveness of state investments in property tax relief and his tax and budget proposals.
But Pillen is an incumbent, and Nebraska rarely changes horses midstream. The last incumbent Republican to lose the Governor’s Mansion was Gov. Kay Orr, who lost to Democrat Ben Nelson in 1990. Pillen had more than $3 million in cash on hand last year, state campaign finance reports show. Many expect him to raise more than $10 million. 
The governor announced his reelection bid in May. His campaign video focused on controversies familiar to those who followed his 2022 campaign, including support for tougher immigration enforcement and other culture-war issues. Pillen, in his end of session speech to state lawmakers, touted the passage of bills that limit high school and college sports participation to students’ sex at birth, banning lab-grown meat and lowering income tax rates.
Herbster said Nebraskans are with Pillen on some of those issues, but he said more needs to be done about core issues that have long been central for statewide campaigns — particularly job creation and reducing property taxes. 
People, Herbster said, are “worried about property taxes.” He said “they’re worried about making ends meet.”
Pillen’s campaign declined to comment Friday on Herbster’s potential bid.
Pillen, whose family owns a major hog operation based in Columbus, has prioritized property tax relief, including investing $1 billion into a state effort to fund more of special education costs and a baseline amount of state aid to K-12 schools. 
The governor said last week that he wants to address property taxes again soon. But state lawmakers face a larger projected deficit this upcoming session than the one senators just filled this spring.
Nebraska Democrats have hinted at an announcement of a gubernatorial candidate as early as this week. Some Democratic political observers have speculated that a state senator might run. Others have made noise about a possible third-party or nonpartisan candidate.
Republicans outnumber Democrats in Nebraska by roughly 2-to-1, with about 22% registered either nonpartisan or with a third party. The GOP primary for governor is May 12. The general election is Nov. 3.

(Photo by Christiana Botic / Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — On the afternoon of Sept. 22, a text thread on Jennie Moctezuma’s phone started flooding with messages after federal immigration authorities appeared near KIPP East Community Primary School in New Orleans East, according to eye witnesses and school administrators.
The messages — sent between members of local immigrant-led civil rights group Unión Migrante — said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted at the end of the street where cars lined up to collect children leaving the school during dismissal.
A former school administrator in New Orleans in the years following Hurricane Katrina, Moctezuma knew the impact of stressful situations — like a parent potentially being arrested and detained — on young minds.
“Children who are in trauma can’t thrive when they’re carrying around fear, even if they’re little,” Moctezuma said in a phone interview in November. “They may not understand what’s happening, but they can certainly feel it.”

When administrators at KIPP New Orleans Schools, the charter school network that runs KIPP East, found out about the agents, they sprang into action. They wanted to make sure that, whatever was happening, dismissal remained safe for children, guardians and school staff, according to the managing director of impact Ashley Daniels-Hall and director of school operations Maleka Williams.
Daniels-Hall said ICE agents were “cooperative” when school administrators asked them to move their vehicles that blocked the pickup line. In an email to other KIPP staff, Daniels-Hall said that ICE was in the neighborhood for “something separate.”
“Thankfully, they did not attempt to interfere with dismissal,” Williams said. The administrators were not aware of anyone connected to the school being arrested.
ICE spokesperson Linsday Williams wrote in an email to Verite News that their, “operations were not conducted at the school and had no impact on its activities.”
It was not the first time immigration officials were seen near a KIPP School. Williams said ICE agents showed up near KIPP Morial, also in New Orleans East, in March. According to Daniels-Hall, agents did not enter the school campus and appeared to be searching for a specific individual.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, promising mass deportations, federal immigration authorities have increasingly been conducting raids and effecting arrests in or near locations once seen as off-limits.
In the first days the beginning of Trump’s second term, the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security — which oversees ICE and U.S. Border Patrol — removed Biden-era measures that placed restrictions on immigration enforcement actions in or near “sensitive locations,” including courthouses, churches, medical facilities and schools. 
“ICE is NOT targeting schools or daycare centers,” read a September press release from ICE.
But in the past few months, there have been documented immigration arrests around a school outside of San Diego and in Oakland, California, both at times of day when parents would be present. And in the midst of stepped-up immigration actions in Chicago as part of operation “Midway Blitz,” immigration agents went inside a daycare center building to arrest a teacher.  School attendance has dropped in Chicago since the immigration crackdown began, particularly in schools in areas that have been targeted.
Fear in New Orleans’ immigrant communities has lately intensified this week, after the Associated Press reported that 250 Border Patrol agents will come to New Orleans and surrounding areas to conduct immigration sweeps, similar to what has happened during Midway Blitz in Chicago and, over the past week, during operation “Charlotte’s Web” in Charlotte, North Carolina.
According to the AP, authorities plan to arrest as many as 5,000 people in Southeast Louisiana as part of operation “Swamp Sweep.”
‘The fears are there’
The day after agents were spotted near KIPP East, Moctezuma drove from her home near the Fairgrounds to meet other Unión Migrante members near the school to canvass the neighborhood. Volunteers circled several blocks surrounding the school and created Facebook Live reels declaring that streets were all clear. They offered to escort children to school, although, she said, no one was needed in that capacity.
While there have not been reports of immigration actions in or directly surrounding New Orleans area schools this year, federal agents have been seen conducting investigations and arrests within a few blocks of schools, according to sources who have spoken with Verite News.
Since the news about Border Patrol’s imminent arrival in New Orleans broke, InspireNOLA CEO Jamar McKneely said he’s received multiple emails from families concerned about what protections schools will offer to make sure students and their families don’t become targets.
“Our families can know how we’re trying to protect them, that they just don’t have to pull their kids out of school, that they don’t have to be concerned,” McKneely said.

K-12 schools are required by federal law to educate students regardless of their immigration status. KIPP New Orleans and InspireNOLA, the largest charter networks in New Orleans, confirmed that they do not collect information regarding family status. That’s also true in Jefferson Parish schools, where 39% of students are Hispanic.
But fears about immigrant tracking laws and activity near schools persist. Clay Moise, a member of the Jefferson Parish School Board, said community members have reached out to him with their concerns.
“The fears are there,” Moise said. “Our response has been the same all along. We don’t allow ICE into our schools as policy.”
NOLA Public Schools did not respond to requests for comment. Gabriela Biro, a board member on the Orleans Parish School Board, speaking in her personal capacity, said she encouraged residents to join groups like Unión Migrante.
Charter school administrators in Orleans Parish have been training staff to prevent potential ICE enforcement on campuses. While McKneely said that InspireNOLA is starting to work on its policies to protect students, Daniels-Hall said KIPP has a clearly outlined process to determine if ICE agents should be allowed on campus, which includes requiring a judicial warrant. Before an agent can come on the grounds, a staff member should work with their legal team to ensure that a warrant is viable, Daniels-Hall said, adding that these extra training measures for front office and operations staff are meant to “keep the school community safe.”
So far, those measures seem to have worked. There have been no appreciable drops in attendance among Hispanic students at KIPP, Moise and Daniels-Hall said. The Sept. 22 incident, Daniels-Hall said, didn’t impact attendance the following day.
But that could change if sweeps intensify due operation Swamp Sweep, which is reportedly set to begin in earnest after Thanksgiving. (While it might have been a coincidence, McKneely said some schools in his network saw a drop in attendance the day after news about Border Patrol coming to New Orleans broke.)
“Schools are a safe place for students and families,” Daniels-Hall said. “[We’re] really reinforcing that we’re doing any and every thing to keep the school community safe, that it’s a safe place and it’s supposed to be a joyful place for children to learn.”

(Photo courtesy of Moms Over Margins)Brown University Health has named the 12 members of its new Community Advisory Panel who will discuss the fate of our beloved Newport Hospital’s Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center. Of the 12 individuals named, five of them are employed in some capacity by Brown University Health and two of them sit on the Newport Hospital Foundation Board; I believe that most of them truly have the best interests of the community in mind, despite the fact there are significant segments of the community unrepresented by this group. 
To be clear, I applaud every individual who is able to serve on the panel, while still wondering if there’s more that can be done by Brown University Health to make this feel like a community-wide process. 
Newport Hospital birthing center community advisory board to hold first meeting next week

I appreciate that it is impractical to invite every single key stakeholder into the room, but those who would be most impacted by the closure of the birthing center — notably, those who do not have the means to travel elsewhere to attend to their reproductive needs, and those within the BIPOC community, who already face statistically and significantly worse maternal health outcomes — may not have a direct voice in this process. 
Furthermore, due to the fact that all members of this Community Advisory Panel are required to sign a confidentiality agreement prior to their participation, I am concerned there may not be as much clarity as the community deserves regarding the discussions and outcomes of these meetings. Brown University Health said panel members were asked to sign the agreement because they will be receiving proprietary information. But there are thousands of people in Newport County who have a right to know what’s going on throughout this process, and Brown University Health has a duty to update the community on what takes place in these closed-door meetings by virtue of the fact that they operate Newport County’s only hospital. The whole community has a very real and critical stake in this outcome, and I urge Brown University Health to be open with the community about when the general public can expect regular and candid briefings about this process and any relevant information discussed at these meetings.
I would also recommend that, when considering a Community Advisory Panel that will determine the future of our island’s families, the timing of these meetings be a little more family-friendly. There will be four meetings to determine the birthing center’s survival, which will take place from 4-5:30 p.m. on weekdays between now and the end of April — the first of which will occur the Monday before Thanksgiving, the busiest travel week in the United States. I was, in fact, invited to participate in the Community Advisory Panel, but I had to decline due to my working hours and our day care’s pickup time, which is one of the latest on the island.

It is understandably impossible to accommodate every individual’s needs and schedule, but the time selected for the meetings does seem to unintentionally exclude most parents and working individuals without flexible schedules, many of whom will likely need or have already used the birthing center’s services.
Newport Hospital’s birthing center has provided exemplary, evidence-based care for decades and is recognized by the World Health Organization and UNICEF as “baby friendly,” becoming only the 40th hospital in the U.S. to earn that distinction. I speak from personal experience when I say that it is the exception, not the rule, to find safe, high-quality, compassionate care in one place for reproductive needs, and the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center goes above and beyond to deliver just that. 
I applaud every person who is selflessly sacrificing their personal and professional time to be a part of this panel and hope that Brown University Health will truly listen and learn from the individuals they have selected about exactly what this birthing center means to our community, the lives it saves, and the profound impact it has on the very fabric of our island.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-23 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Could CT have a nuclear energy future? Not if you’re in a rush,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/23/ct-nuclear-energy-future/,"The owner of the one nuclear station in CT sees the challenges of building new nuclear here. If those could be overcome, it would be a long way off.","Nuclear power seems to be having a moment.
As the Trump administration methodically throws up roadblocks to slow, if not stop, carbon-free renewable solar and wind power, carbon-free nuclear appears to be the go-to idea for large amounts of power that are presumed to be needed in the future for data centers, AI and more. 
Nevermind that before two new nuclear plants opened in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 — seven years late and double their original budget — there had been no new nuclear power plants in the U.S. in more than 30 years. 
Now the chatter is around so-called small modular and micro-reactors — touted as easier, cheaper, and faster, leading to a public perception they are ready to be pulled off the shelf and plugged in.
But here’s the problem with that. They don’t exist yet.
Former Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chair Allison Macfarlane, now director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, is among those who are frustrated with the public and governmental belief about small modular reactors, also known as SMRs. 
“They do think that,” she said of the public perception that small nuclear reactors are an immediate option to help meet energy needs. “A lot of the media writes about these things as if they do exist. ‘We know that they’re cheap, we know that they’re safe.’ But we don’t know anything, because they don’t exist.”
But they are in development. As of last summer, the Nuclear Energy Agency dashboard listed 127 different small modular reactor designs in existence globally, with about 60% of them in active stages of research and development. 
There are three reactors operating around the world that are reported to be small reactors: A floating one in Russia powering a remote Arctic region and two in China, but details about those projects have not been shared.

The SMRs are often bundled under the category of advanced nuclear energy. That advanced designation generally refers to the supposedly newer ways they are cooled, and changes to pressurization and uranium formulation common to the water-cooled light-water reactors that comprise most of the world-wide nuclear reactor fleet today. 
“Advanced is rather a misnomer of a term,” Macfarlane said, echoing the views of others. “It should really be non-light-water, because ‘advanced’ suggests there’s something new here, and there isn’t anything new. Most of these technologies have been tried for 50 to 70 years.”
She said eight countries have tried to build more than 25 different versions of one of the technologies — sodium-cooled fast reactors. “No one has been able to get them to produce electricity economically, viably and reliably.”
What do we know and what don’t we know about updated nuclear power options? And how realistic are any of them — including in Connecticut?
The short answer — even the owner of the one nuclear station in Connecticut sees the challenges of building new nuclear in the state. And if those could be overcome, it would be a long way off.
The basics of nuclear power haven’t changed much in decades. It’s carbon-free. The classic units — like the 94 stations operating in the U.S. — can generate a lot of power. The two units at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station total about 2,100 megawatts. Plants can provide that power 24/7 with planned interruptions for re-fueling and maintenance. Despite a plant’s large footprint compared to similarly sized fossil fuel power, it takes up far less space than renewables such as wind and solar fields.
It’s more efficient than other forms of power, including renewables, which means nuclear doesn’t lose as high a percentage of its power as other power sources do. Some nuclear systems require a lot of water for cooling — but so do conventional power plants — leaving both vulnerable to droughts, floods and warming water, some of which are due to climate change.
But nuclear power is not renewable and its radioactive waste is not really recyclable, as some claim. Plants take a long time to build and they cost a lot of money. 
Enter the notion of small nuclear power plants broadly, and SMRs specifically.
Smaller nuclear units
“I find the name SMR a little bit misleading because it should be called smaller modular reactor, because they’re still 300 megawatts,” said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT. “This is a substantial facility, requires a lot of civil work, site excavation. So it’s not a factory-produced reactor by any stretch of the imagination.”
Buongiorno said the first one likely to be built in North America is from BWRX — a longstanding nuclear company — at the Darlington nuclear site in Canada. It’s slated for 300 megawatts. 
An early-stage project in Wyoming by TerraPower, a private company founded by Bill Gates, will be 345 megawatts. In October the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, approved its environmental impact statement, the first such designation for new technology nuclear.

The federal government-owned Tennessee Valley Authority, TVA, is also building what it calls an advanced nuclear SMR that uses molten-salt cooling. The unit by Kairos, a startup, is not expected to go online before 2030.
Prior to these efforts, the Biden administration had approved one new project by another startup — NuScale — for a unit in Idaho. But that plan dissolved when costs increased. A larger NuScale design was approved in May by the Trump administration.
Also in May, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to speed up several aspects of nuclear development. They include adding 300 gigawatts — that’s 300,000 megawatts — of nuclear power by 2050. And they order the NRC to speed up licensing, which some see as dangerous rubber stamping. Earlier this month, Trump nominated a former executive at Westinghouse, a longtime player in the nuclear space, to the NRC.
But Buongiorno and others said, as an alternative to the SMR, there is a proven modernized reactor already available in the U.S. — the AP1000 — Westinghouse’s full-size reactor. 
“It’s a great design. It’s an American design. And my personal opinion is that our best bet if we want to grow nuclear is to build more of those AP1000s,” he said. “The downside of the AP1000 and any other large reactor is it takes time to build these units, and it costs a lot of money.”
That is also the reactor used in the two new units added to Georgia’s existing Vogtle plant. But Buongiorno said it would be a mistake to judge the economics of a new big reactor like the AP1000 by the Vogtle experience. It was the first of its kind so likely to be more expensive and slower, though he admitted overall the U.S. nuclear industry does not have the greatest construction track record.     
Westinghouse also hadn’t built a nuclear plant in a generation, which brings up another category of problems. The kind of skilled workforce and expertise needed to build and maintain a nuclear facility has all but vanished in the U.S., as has the supply chain that once supported nuclear construction. While the fuel supply is the same for old and new nuclear plants, there’s not enough of it and some of what is needed comes from Russia.

Then there is the question of whether SMRs and micro-reactors will be cheaper and easier to build. The answer depends on the definition of cheaper and easier, especially considering the cost per unit of power.
Ask Buongiorno if it’s cheaper: “The answer is absolutely no. We expect, actually, small, modular reactors to produce energy that will be more expensive than large reactors. This is a mathematical certainty.”
Ask Macfarlane: “It’s quite realistic — at least the light water reactor designs are realistic. The advanced designs less so.” In fact, Macfarlane has just co-written a paper on the cost question. “We conclude that economies of scale still will hold. It’s just simply cheaper to build a single, large light water reactor than 10 small ones,” she said.
Ask Jeff Semancik, the Radiation Division director at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP): “There’s a trade-off that you’re looking at between what are the upfront capital costs versus the long term cost of electricity.”
On the other hand, Buongiorno points out that investors will perceive the upfront risk as smaller.
“If the check that you need to write at the beginning of the project to build the plant is $3 billion instead of $10 billion, the risk associated with the project is significantly smaller. And that’s really the value proposition for the smaller reactors, the overall project risk, financial as well as execution. There is less to build.”
It’s generally thought the footprint for an SMR won’t be that much smaller, especially if the plan is to install several at once. Siting might be a little easier because of new safety systems that require a smaller perimeter, though factors like access to transmission lines or availability of transmission capacity could impact siting and cost.
The lower the power, the less potential radioactivity if a problem arises. There’s also less radioactive waste, though there’s still no U.S. repository to store it.
As the scale continues to shrink, Buongiorno believes his point about the cost per kilowatt hour continues to hold true. Power from microreactors would be even more expensive per unit, but they are a different animal. They are envisioned to be 10-15 megawatts, but could be as small as one megawatt. The concept is also more as a standalone system that’s not necessarily tied to the grid, so the need for transmission and distribution and its costs may be avoided even though the power itself costs more.
Their use, experts say, would be more for out-of-the-way or hard-to-access locations where connecting to a grid would be extremely expensive or even impossible and where the alternative might be diesel generators. Think remote mining camps or extreme rural Alaska without connecting highways. Or for use by the military, which the Trump executive orders specifically target. The military has a history of small reactor use in things like submarines and aircraft carriers going back decades, though the technologies are not the same as land units.
“The business model is very different. These are not grid-connected electric generators. These are co-located with their end users” Buongiorno said. “So the devil is in the detail of these things, which means it’s all going to be site- and customer-dependent.”
Microreactors are expected to be easily transportable with other needed components, but they are even less developed than SMRs. An initial testing pilot project in the U.S. is expected next summer, which may be aggressive timing, even though some of the well-known and experienced nuclear companies are looking at them. So true deployment, even if everything goes well, is still years away.
What it means for Connecticut
New nuclear is on the table here.
In the last few legislative sessions, lawmakers cleared a slight path. They lifted the state’s nuclear moratorium for the Dominion site in Waterford, which houses Millstone, thereby allowing for nuclear expansion at that location. They also established a process for municipalities to begin consideration of hosting new nuclear facilities and authorized $5 million in bond funds for DEEP to give grants for technical assistance for early site permitting.
To that end, in October DEEP announced informational sessions beginning in December to help municipalities better understand what nuclear power and its new iterations entail.
DEEP is aware of the realities of potential new nuclear power, as evidenced in this 2024 report that noted advanced nuclear technology, SMRs and more are in early stages and that “cost competitiveness has not yet been demonstrated and is unlikely to be realized unless or until such technologies move beyond ‘first of a kind’ projects and are deployed at scale.”
In other words, there’s a long way to go.
“It’s a significant amount of time that’s required to get these large projects off the ground,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, noting that a project like Revolution Wind, under construction now, first solicited proposals in 2017. “Many of the resources that we’re talking about now and planning and engaging on, we’re contemplating deployment and commercial operation timelines that are in the late 2030s. That’s not unique to nuclear.”
But Connecticut does have some unique circumstances with nuclear — some helpful, some less so.
Dykes thinks the national lack of a nuclear workforce is less of an issue here with existing training at Three Rivers Community College in partnership with Dominion, as well as the skill sets associated with the state’s large defense industry — especially submarines and their nuclear components. And she said DEEP already is responsible for nuclear safety.
On the other hand, she and others point out that a deregulated utility market like Connecticut’s could face challenges with nuclear’s expense. 
“How do we create the right balance in terms of the investment approach here to making our market an attractive place to invest while not burdening ratepayers with all of the risks of cost increases?” she asked.
In the meantime, in late October, Connecticut signed on as the 12th observer state to an effort known as Advanced Nuclear First Movers, which also has 11 full state members. Its inception was several years ago through the National Association of State Energy Officials, NASEO, as an education mechanism around advanced and other new nuclear.
Now more formalized, the group is working through the variables and unknowns as states consider the various technologies in the face of state climate policies, electricity needs and costs.
Nuclear, while promising, is not a panacea, said David Terry, NASEO’s president. “It’s kind of flashy in the news right now for good reason, because people are interested. But it’s not a panacea,” he said. 
And with trying to figure out what kind of power to use 30 years from now and a lead time that could be a decade, the message, he said, is to weigh the pros and cons carefully. “And, oh, by the way, if you choose the wrong thing and you choose too many of the wrong thing, you’re going to pay dearly.”

CT history
Connecticut’s nuclear history dates to the 1968 opening of the Connecticut Yankee in Haddam, which stopped producing electricity in 1996. Millstone Unit 1 began operation in 1971 and it stopped producing electricity in 1995. Units 2 and 3 — which are still running — opened in 1975 and 1986 respectively, with Unit 2 just celebrating its 50th year. Each has had its license extended, to 2035 and 2045 respectively.
The Millstone units constitute about one-third of the power generated in Connecticut and along with the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, the only other nuclear plant operating in New England, supply one-quarter to one-third of the region’s power.
The Millstone units have older technology systems that use Long Island Sound, which is literally outside their doors, for intake and discharge water. In the summer of 2012 after a very warm winter and summer, Unit 2 shut down for 12 days due to intake water temperatures that exceeded what was allowable. The NRC subsequently approved an increase in allowable water temperature and Dominion spokesperson Susan Adams said via email there have been no issues since.
That incident followed a situation in August of 2011 when water from the Sound overtopped the seawall around the plant during Tropical Storm Irene. Adams did not respond directly to the question of whether this has happened since.
The company has clear procedures in place to respond immediately to prevent any impact to operations, she said in an email. “If a storm is coming, we have in our procedures to build a 2-foot-high wall with sandbags around the doors of specific locations.”
The Union of Concerned Scientists has tracked nuclear power safety for years. The director of that effort, Ed Lyman, said climate issues such as rising water temperatures, drought that causes reduced water, flooding and more intense storms are not necessarily safety issues. “But they could be a real operational issues if it has to shut down for some period of time.” He also said plants in Europe, in particular, have had to lower power output during heat waves in recent years.
After the flooding of the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011, the U.S. looked at the flood standards for its plants. “It turns out that nearly every plant in the country, when they did these assessments, they found out that they were probably vulnerable to more severe flooding than they were designed to withstand,” Lyman said.
With the moratorium now removed for additional building on the Millstone site, there has been some chatter that, despite its proximity to the water, it might be a good location for SMRs given that transmission and interconnections are already available.
Semancik at DEEP said the effects of climate change are considered when sites are selected. “You’re required to do a meteorological, hydrological study of all the sites, including what the potential exists going forward,” he said.
While Dominion has expressed interest in SMR development, Adams noted in a lengthy written response that their focus on SMRs at the moment is at a location in Virginia.
“While we’re not opposed to an SMR at Millstone Power Station, Connecticut might not have the regulatory environment for one. The upfront costs for an SMR, though less expensive than traditional nuclear, are significant enough that Connecticut’s deregulated market might not support such a project,” Adams said, echoing Dykes’ concern. “However, we still plan to work with Connecticut’s policymakers on potential paths to taking advantage of SMR’s next-generation nuclear technology.”

Now what?
Buongiorno offers three thoughts on why nuclear can still be considered worthwhile.
One is that in the face of Trump administration policies that don’t advocate decarbonization, if that is a still a state goal, nuclear is the lowest carbon energy source available and it’s scalable. Another is its reliability. It can run 24/7, which means it is stable and therefore keeps the grid stable. And third is its local economic benefits. It provides high-paying permanent jobs in addition to the initial construction jobs. And a facility will pay local taxes.
But he said: “If we need more power between now and the end of 2030, then nuclear can play a fairly limited role.”
And, of course, you have to be willing to pay. “But I got news for you — you got to be willing to pay for any of the energy technology that you choose,” Buongiorno said. “There is no free lunch.”
That’s something Dykes knows all too well.
“How do you do that? What will it cost? How can you de-risk it?” the DEEP commissioner asked. “How can we make sure the costs are shared equally among those who benefit from the investment?”
Former NRC Chair Macfarlane offers a stark answer when asked whether it’s realistic to move ahead with the new reactor designs.
“I don’t think so,” she said. “It depends on what you want to do. And if you either want to A, address climate change or B, address the energy needs from AI, … it means you have to address it immediately, like yesterday, and none of these technologies are available.”
She said it may be something to continue to develop and see if will work. But she said it will probably take a couple of decades to commercialize. 
“To put all our treasure into nuclear right now is not very smart.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCK_4724-scaled-e1763585120220-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-11-23 05:01:20.932111

In March 1942 it had published “The Case Against the Jews,” a polemic by 33-year-old journalist and conscientious objector Milton Mayer.

(UCLA Library Special Collections)The Saturday Evening Post was in trouble.
In March 1942 it had published “The Case Against the Jews,” a polemic by 33-year-old journalist and conscientious objector Milton Mayer. Two years before, also in the pages of the Post, Mayer had urged the United States to stay out of World War II because another global conflict would do more harm than good. Now the young activist, who was of Jewish heritage himself, accused American Jews of losing their souls by being assimilated into materialistic, gentile culture.
Subscriptions were canceled and so many advertisers lost that the Post had to double its newsstand price, to a dime. With a circulation of just over 3 million, the Post was America’s best-selling publication. But with the trouble caused by Mayer’s piece, it saw the top spot go to Life, an upstart photo magazine not yet a decade old.
If there was a star at the Saturday Evening Post, it was Norman Rockwell.
Rockwell, whose saccharine illustrations of American life featuring cooks, policemen, housewives in bathrobes, and boys and dogs adorned many Post covers, watched the turmoil at the magazine with concern, according to Rockwell biographer Deborah Solomon. There were rumors the magazine was about to fold.
“When he thought about the Post going under, he wasn’t sure whether his career would be over, or whether he would be better off,” Solomon writes in “American Mirror,” her 2013 biography of Rockwell. “At least his life would be in his own hands. Tired of answering to Post editors, he wanted to do something major, to alter his fate.”
The Post, which had a reputation of being isolationist, anti-New Deal, and skeptical of the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, found itself in a precarious spot. The country had entered World War II less than four months before and the outcome seemed anything but certain. In Europe, the Nazis had invaded Poland, Belgium, Holland, France — and now Russia. Jews, dissidents, homosexuals, Romani, and Soviet prisoners of war were being sent to Dachau, but it was not yet known the forced labor concentration camp was transforming into an extermination machine. In the Pacific, the Philippines had fallen to the Japanese and Gen. Douglas MacArthur had fled the island stronghold of Corregidor. Since Pearl Harbor, American resolve had turned against the powers of fascism and imperialism.
The Post was in danger of losing the trust of the American people.
Curtis Publishing sacked Post editor Wesley Stout and a couple of other names high on the masthead. The new editor was Ben Hibbs, a Kansan who was editing the Country Gentleman, another Curtius publication, aimed at the business of farming.
Hibbs was 40. He had grown up in Pretty Prairie, a town of a few hundred in south-central Kansas. His first byline, at the age of 10, was an announcement for the local paper about his fourth grade class hosting a Saturday morning picnic at the Old Settlers Grove.
“I suppose I never had a chance to be anything but a journalist,” he mused. “To me the English language has always seemed to be an instrument of beauty and precision, and from early boyhood the mere act of setting down words on paper has kindled within me a pleasant glow of inner excitement.”
He worked his way through journalism school at the University of Kansas in Lawrence by working in a brick plant, sweeping up the local Methodist church, and bussing trays in the cafeteria. After graduation, his first job was as a reporter at a newspaper at Pratt, and he was soon writing about moonshiners in the sandhills. He later took a job as an English instructor at the college at Fort Hays, he recalled. But he wasn’t happy and soon returned to journalism.
His last job in Kansas was as managing editor of the Arkansas City Traveler. Then Curtis Publishing of Philadelphia offered him a job as an associate editor of the Country Gentlemen, a publication with an eye-popping circulation of more than 2 million. When he became editor of the magazine in 1940, he introduced himself to readers as a Kansas product who loved America and believed in human freedoms.
He said he had “an abiding faith in the triumph of human liberties over brutality and blood and ruin which darken half the world, that (I believe) passionately that the decency and fundamental rightness of the people, particularly the common folks, will carry this nation through the storm and dangers of the years we now live.”
He rejected isolationism because science had erased the protections of time and distance. After Pearl Harbor, he urged Americans to stay “mad, fighting mad” to accomplish the tasks ahead and to give their children a chance at a peaceful future.
“Ben Hibbs speaks the ‘Kansas language’ so well and so consistently that his style of writing may be expected to have some influence on the tradition-bound Saturday Evening Post,” predicted an opinion writer at the Kansas City Star in March 1942.
The writer then quoted Hibbs on a recent visit to his Kansas hometown.
“There are thousands of Pretty Prairies throughout this land and therein lies my faith in America. … In the country and the country towns there is still a stability of thought and life which is our greatest bulwark in time of crisis.”
As Hibbs was being named editor of the Post, Rockwell was wrestling with his artistic crisis. In May 1940 a former administrator of the Museum of Modern Art, Thomas D. Mabry, now assigned to a division that produced graphics for the war department, told Rockwell that one of their urgent needs was for posters depicting the four freedoms as outlined by Roosevelt in his 1941 State of the Union address. But the material assigned to Rockwell to illustrate, including the Atlantic Charter, was too abstract to render into a painting, according to biographer Solomon.
How do you visualize freedom?
The answer came to Rockwell as he was lying in bed in his Arlington, Vermont, home at 3 one morning. He’d recently attended a town meeting during which a working-class acquaintance had spoken against a plan to rebuild a school that had burned down.
“Nobody agreed with him, but everyone listened,” Solomon wrote.
That’s it, Rockwell thought. That’s freedom of speech.
Rockwell could show Roosevelt’s four freedoms — speech, worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear — by painting his neighbors doing ordinary things, as Solomon put it. Rockwell was at his studio by 5 that morning, roughing out sketches.
But the Office of War Information was not enthusiastic about Rockwell’s sketches. Rockwell was told the OWI wasn’t looking for illustrators, according to Solomon, but for fine arts men — real artists.
On his way back home, Rockwell stopped in Philadelphia for a meeting with his new editor, Hibbs. If Hibbs didn’t immediately recognize that Rockwell had the idea for some of the most iconic images in popular art, he at least saw a chance to counter the anti-Mayer backlash and shore up relations with the Roosevelt White House.
“Drop everything else,” Hibbs told him. “Just do the Four Freedoms.”
Rockwell spent the next seven months on the paintings, according to the Saturday Evening Post’s website. They were published weekly starting Feb. 20, 1943, each occupying a full page (and the pages were big back then, 10 by 13 inches) and accompanied with an essay. The essays were by Booth Tarkington, Will Durant, Carlos Bulosan, and Stephen Vincent Benét.
“Freedom of Speech” was the first in the series, a realization of the sketch of the town hall meeting, with a forgettable essay by Tarkington.
“Freedom of Worship” came next. It is a tightly framed composition of mostly white faces and hands in prayer representing several mainstream faiths. It is considered to be the weakest of the series. It is a pleasing composition, but does not convey the constitutional guarantee of freedom of — and freedom from — religion.
“Worship” is accompanied by an essay by Durant that is at once offensively pompous and puerile: “When we yield our sons to war, it is in the trust that their sacrifice will bring to us … the privilege of winning for all peoples the most precious gifts in the orbit of life — freedom of body and soul.”
“Freedom from Want” was third, with an essay by Filipino-American novelist and poet Bulosan. This is the illustration that depicts a family at Thanksgiving dinner, with a grandmotherly type placing a huge roast turkey on the family table. The essay is the best and bravest of the four, with Bulosan writing on behalf of the working poor, migrants, artists and intellectuals, and the disaffected.
“If you want to know what we are, look upon the farms or upon the hard pavements of the city,” he writes. “You usually see us working or waiting for work or waiting for work, and you think you know us, but our outward guise is more deceptive than our history.”
Bulosan talks about Kansas wheat and Mississippi rain, of the winds of the Great Lakes, of the timbers in Oregon and wildflowers in Maine.
“We are multitudes in Pennsylvania mines, in Alaskan canneries,” he writes. “We are millions from Puget Sound to Florida. In violent factories, crowded tenements, teeming cities. Our numbers increase as the war revolves into years and increases hunger, disease, death, and fear.”
The fourth painting, “Freedom from Fear,” finished the series with the March 13, 1943, issue. It depicts a white couple tucking their children into bed for the night, the father holding a newspaper with a headline about German bombings. The accompanying Benét essay is unremarkable.
The Rockwell paintings were an immediate hit. The government made them the centerpiece of a new war bonds campaign and a seemingly endless series of posters followed. You can still buy them as prints from the Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where the artist lived the last 25 years of his life.
In 1943, the paintings weren’t just popular art but an articulation of what many Americans were searching to put into words. What were we fighting for? What are the things that are most precious to us? What is the promise of American democracy? They were an affirmation in oil paint of our basic decency, of our shared dreams, and a belief in the future. The paintings helped us make sense of an otherwise senseless world. They are flawed by mid-century prejudices and assumptions, something the Post seems to acknowledge in part with the Bulosan essay, but they are as near a universal artistic declaration of democracy as we could have expected, if not hoped for.
For a 21st century reimagining of “Freedom from Fear” and the other paintings, Smithsonian magazine featured the work of artists Ryan Schude, Edel Rodriguez, Tim O’Brien, and Melinda Beck.
Rockwell would continue his work long after World War II, and he would wrestle in a more realistic way with American democracy in “The Problem We All Live With.” It is a 1963 depiction of a Black child, Ruby Bridges, being accompanied by U.S. marshals as she walks past racist graffiti on her way to school.
Rockwell died in 1978, at the age of 84.
Hibbs died before him, of leukemia, in 1974. He was 73.
His obituary in the New York Times noted that Hibbs, who helmed the Post for 20 years, had been a personal friend of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He had met Eisenhower when, during World War II, the general invited him and other journalists to tour Dachau to counter misinformation that atrocities there had been exaggerated.
In other words, Hibbs was brought to the death camp to fight the first round of Holocaust denial. Some 40,000 individuals died there, of overwork, disease, starvation, and execution. In total, the Nazis killed six million Jew and millions of others.
“I have been asked by many people if the concentration camps were as bad as the newspapers have been saying,” Hibbs wrote in the Post. “I can answer in one word: Worse.”
Milton Mayer, the young writer who in 1942 upset the Post applecart, survived the furor over his essay. A decade later he traveled to Germany and interviewed the residents of a midsized town about how ordinary people felt about the Nazi regime. What he found, reported in his 1955 book “They Thought They Were Free,” is that the descent into totalitarianism was so gradual that most people didn’t notice it.
Mayer died in 1986, at 77. The book is Mayer’s best known work.
In it, he concluded that otherwise decent individuals had allowed themselves to be seduced by lies, and some clung to those lies long after the defeat of the Nazis.

It might depend on where you live.,"Is it possible to live in our state without a car?
We have over 1.1 million cars registered in Connecticut (not counting SUVs, pickups and vans) for our 2.6 million licensed drivers. But that still doesn’t account for another half-million adults who don’t drive, by choice or economic necessity.


According to AAA, in Connecticut it costs about $11,000 a year to operate a new car (not counting its purchase price), well above the national average. You can blame high insurance premiums, property taxes, registration and maintenance… plus the cost of gasoline. That means the average driver pays about 70 cents a mile to drive.
But in most of the state, access to a car is essential for daily living, especially if you’re older.
Something like 19% of all Connecticut residents are over age 65. Over age 70, traffic fatalities increase with age; by age 85, drivers have probably outlived their ability to drive safely.
Every year some 600,000 adults in the U.S. stop driving. But because seniors make 90% of their trips in private cars, either driving or as passengers, what happens next?
When seniors stop driving it impacts more than their mobility. It can also affect their health. Seniors who stop driving make 15% fewer trips to the doctor. They can’t get out to shop as much. They isolate socially, which can lead to depression and a downward spiral in health.
Living in the suburbs, 80% of seniors reside in car-dependent neighborhoods. Some 53% of those areas don’t have sidewalks and 60% are not within a ten minute walk of a transit stop, assuming the elders can still walk that distance.
The cost of bus fare isn’t the main reason that dissuades seniors from riding the bus. It’s not knowing where the bus stops are, when they run, the lack of a shelter and, yes, probably a fear for their safety. Plus not all buses kneel, which makes boarding a challenge.
Many affluent communities offer free or low-cost ride services for seniors (and others with disabilities). In Greenwich there’s “Call A Ride,” in Fairfield “Dial A Ride” and in Darien “At Home in Darien.” And several cities offer on-demand, Uber-like services such as Norwalk and Westport’s “Wheels2U” and New Haven’s “Via NHV.”
At the other end of the mobility spectrum, many of our cities and towns have gone to great expense installing bike lanes. But when’s the last time you saw them being used? They sound great, offering a chance for exercise and enhanced mobility, but they’re hardly useful year-round. And they certainly don’t replace the utility of a car.
Metro-North, Shore Line East and the Hartford Line are great if you’re going to a city center. But getting to the station usually means relying on a car. And when you alight from the train in many towns, that last-mile to your destination still involves a cab or bus (if it runs your way).
So can you live, work and play in our state without a car? You decide.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/wheels-2U-1024x591.jpg,,,2025-11-23 05:01:20.932111

Since being appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to the position in July, Ingoglia has held press conferences in some of the state’s cities and counties, where he has aggressively called out alleged overspending. It’s been a central feature of the state’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts, later rebranded by Ingoglia as the Florida Agency For Fiscal Oversight (FAFO). 
The media events are also a way to plug a (still to be written) constitutional amendment for the 2026 ballot that likely will ask Floridians if they support reducing or possibly eliminating property taxes on homestead properties.
“We’re not going away,” Ingoglia said during a press conference in Seminole County in September. “We’re going to continue beating this drum from now up until the time that we get actual property tax reform on the ballot in 2026.”
Seminole County Republican County Commissioner Lee Constantine isn’t impressed.
“This whole thing is a made-for-television event, and it’s specifically made for television for the CFO’s reelection,” he said Wednesday during the Florida Association of Counties 2025 legislative meeting. That’s where he and Broward County Democratic County Commissioner Steven Geller traded stories about their counties’ FAFO audits.
Geller, who served in both chambers of the Legislature for 20 years (1988-2018), criticized the calculations Ingoglia’s office derived to allege that Broward has indulged in $189 million in “wasteful spending” over the past five years. 
“Check the numbers,” he said. “Because they are fictitious. Made-up. Phony. False.”
Constantine, too, questioned the accuracy of some of the CFO’s numbers for Seminole County. He found it telling that, when a local reporter asked Ingoglia to provide specific examples of alleged waste, “He couldn’t answer specifically where he got it, referring to the suggestion his county had indulged in $48 million in excessive and wasteful spending.”
 “He also could not answer all this money we were overspending. Give us one example. Just one.” 
Similar criticism has come from additional local governments that have received a FAFO audit. The CFO has said that he ultimately will come forward with thosse details.
The governor’s office did release a statement on Oct. 1 with 10 specific examples of such alleged overspending by local governments around the state, such as the city of Jacksonville spending $75,000 for a hologram of Mayor Donna Deegan greeting travelers at Jacksonville International Airport in multiple languages.
(Deegan responded in a written statement; “Mayors greet travelers at airports across the country and use multimedia platforms to promote their cities as tourist destinations. This is just a new and innovative way to do that.”)
The Seminole audit came shortly after the five-member Seminole County Commission — all Republicans — voted 4-1 to increase the base property tax rate by 0.5 mills in the face of a $35 million budget deficit, a 10% increase over the previous year.
Constantine defended the increase Wednesday, saying it was the county’s first in 16 years. He went on to say that the commission sent Ingoglia a letter immediately after he held his press conference but didn’t receive an immediate response.
“Crickets,” he said.
Days later, Seminole County went public in a press release.
“On October 7, the CFO’s Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight (FAFO) presentation alleged that County spending exceeds an index he created based on population growth and inflation,” part of the release said. “However, the CFO’s model ignores more than $120 million of state-imposed mandates and essential services that Seminole County is legally required to fund.”
Ingoglia then “started calling some of our prominent citizens … and asked if they would endorse him for CFO. And they all said, ‘Not until you make it right in Seminole County,'” Constantine continued.

That’s when the CFO sent a letter to the county commissioners, thanking them for their efforts and saying that “no future action” was needed on their part, other than to “continue to look out for the taxpayers of Seminole County.”
Constantine is actually grateful for the whole exercise, because he says it allowed county officials to further inform their citizens about the need for the property tax increase. “The CFO did not move the needle in my county at all,” he said. “In fact, after our response, it was much more positive for the tax increase than it was before.”

Advice for other counties
When asked what advice they would give other counties facing similar scrutiny, Geller said it’s incumbent that “you get the information out to your voters.”
“We all know this is only being done as part of the governor’s tax elimination package for ad valorem taxes, and you have to start attacking those numbers,” he added.
The answer is not to respond directly to the CFO’s office.
“They’re not going to apologize,” Constantine said. “They’re not going to change their mind. They’re not going to say, ‘Oh, we now studied the numbers and this county is doing great.’ So, your real response is to your citizens, and letting them know exactly where your money is being spent, and why it’s being spent, and that’s something that we have to do every day, anyway.”
The Phoenix reached out to CFO Ingoglia’s office for comment.
“The CFO’s message to these big government apologists is clear: Stop lying to the taxpayers and stop wasting money to the tune of tens of hundreds of millions of dollars each year,” said Sydney Booker, communications director for Ingoglia.

Despite a 9-1 central committee vote and the backing of Jackson, however, Harris still has a ways to go before he can be considered the nominee. Because the 27th District includes parts of three counties, Calvert, Charles and Prince George’s, central committees in all three get to have their say. Charles was just the first.
Harris was one of three candidates who appeared during the nearly two-hour special public hearing, along with fellow District 27 Del. Jeffrie Long and lawyer Jason Fowler, who had ran unsuccessfully in the district before.
Harris represents District 27A, which covers parts of Prince George’s and Charles; Long represents District 27B, which includes Prince George’s and Calvert counties; Fowler ran in 27C, which is all Calvert and currently held by Republican Del. Mark Fisher.
Fowler’s experience in that part of the district was a key part of his argument to the central committee.
“The other two candidates that are here today in this process are first-term delegates. They have never faced general election opposition,” he said. “This district is too diverse, too competitive and too important to leave to somebody that is untested.”

Several of the 11 central committee members said the choice wasn’t easy among the three candidates, but the majority still chose Harris, who’s served in the House of Delegates since 2023.
The final vote was nine for Harris, with committee member Melissa Davis voting for Fowler and committee member Abena McCallister abstaining. Long did not receive a vote at this hearing.
“I’m hoping to see each of you be [future] candidates and be vocal members within our community in Southern Maryland to carry on the promises and ideas that you do have,” said committee member Desmond Rozier. “Organizing and advocating doesn’t stop in office.”
Each candidate had a chance to address the committee and each was asked the same list of questions, while the other candidates were out of the room in what was a largely low-key meeting.
The candidates generally agreed on the need to support mass transit to connect the Southern Maryland district to Washington, D.C., and on working with those who may have differing viewpoints.
A few chuckles came after Hammad Martin, who manages a law firm in Charles County, spoke in support of Fowler and called him “the white Obama.”
Long, elected to the House of Delegates in November 2022, was the only one of the three to mention the Trump administration and its impact on the state’s financial situation.
“A lot of what we’re facing as a budget crisis is a direct result of President Trump and his adversarial administration,” Long said. “I do believe that once we see brighter days, which will come, we can reinvest into programming so vital to our communities.”
As for Harris, he was the only person to mention Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) mantra to “leave no one behind.” Moore is an Army veteran.
“In this case, we [are] leaving no counties behind. So, one team, one fight,” Harris, a Navy veteran, said before the committee voted.

Harris won the endorsement of the former senator, Jackson, who stepped down 10 days ago to become superintendent of the Maryland State Police. Jackson called Harris “a person of service” who will help all three counties in the district.
“I believe in folks who are of service. He shows that continually,” Jackson said.
After Harris was chosen, he thanked the committee, the other two candidates and those in the audience for attending.
“Without you all, we don’t have a community,” he said.
The Prince George’s Democratic Central Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing Tuesday to select a candidate for the vacant Senate seat, followed by the Calvert County Democratic Central Committee next Saturday.
But the decision could be made before Calvert meets: According to an Oct. 21 letter from the Maryland Attorney General’s office, each central committee has one vote on the Senate nominee, so if Harris gets the backing of Prince George’s, the race would be over.
“If two [central committees] select candidate A and one selects candidate B, the name of candidate A is sent to the Governor,” the letter said, but if each settle on a different candidate, all three names go to the governor, who makes the choice.
Once a name, or names, are sent to the governor, he has up to 15 days to make the appointment.
The committees could be meeting again soon, depending on who is nominated. If Harris gets the nod, the Democratic committees in Charles and Prince George’s counties would have to meet to nominate someone to fill his District 27A in the House. Should Long win, central committees in Prince George’s and Calvert would meet to fill his seat.
The committees have a little less than two months to seat a delegation before the Jan. 14 start of the 2026 General Assembly.

But as a national conversation has arisen about cash bail and public safety, fueled by misinformation from the White House, Massachusetts is on the sidelines.  
At the same time, Massachusetts has been undergoing its own experiment with releasing people who would otherwise be detained pretrial this summer—people who were denied their right to counsel while bar advocates declined taking new appointed cases, holding out for a pay raise to continue serving as public defenders.  
In light of these developments, now is a critical time to pursue evidence-based policy that fosters both community safety and racial justice. Massachusetts can take up that mantel with holistic pretrial reform to reduce the use of cash bail and pretrial detention. 
For people who are legally presumed innocent, cash bail produces wealth-based detention and a two-tiered system of justice: freedom for those with financial means, and detention in conditions indistinguishable from punishment for those without.  
The vast majority of people prosecuted for crimes in the Commonwealth are indigent. Therefore, for many accused people, posting any amount of bail can be nearly impossible. Given the socioeconomic and racial wealth disparities throughout Massachusetts, the Commonwealth’s current system of release and detention disparately burdens people of color. This affects entire families, who scrape together funds to buy their loved ones’ freedom. And any system which releases someone based on their access to wealth, rather than their true threat, enables precisely the severe harms to individual and community safety we all want to prevent.  
Eight years have passed since the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court first required judges to consider the financial circumstances of people accused of crimes when deciding whether to impose cash bail as a condition of release. One year later, the Legislature adopted omnibus criminal justice reform legislation that sought to reduce stark racial disparities in incarceration, reduce the criminal system’s overall footprint, and study continued bail reform.  
While that set of reforms resulted in some important gains in justice and community safety, the benefits of the limited pretrial reforms were not distributed equally: new research from the Roundtable on Racial Disparities in Massachusetts Criminal Courts, a project of the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management of the Harvard Kennedy School Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy, provides suggestive evidence that white people have been the biggest, and nearly only, beneficiaries of the limited pretrial reforms adopted since 2017. As the jail population fell statewide, that decrease was almost entirely among white defendants.  
To better understand why this happened, we examined two sources of pretrial detention: cash bail and prosecutors’ requests to hold people without bail because they are alleged to be too dangerous to release pretrial. We found that racial disparities continue to pervade pretrial detention and release decision-making, even controlling for factors like the severity of criminal charges and whether the criminal accusation carries a potential penalty of a mandatory minimum sentence.  
Black and Hispanic people continue to have bail set more often and in higher amounts relative to white people. We also found gaps and inconsistencies in available data about criminal system decision points. For example, a 2016 study by the Council on State Governments Justice Center identified outstanding warrants, probation detainers, and bail revocation as larger sources of pretrial detention than dangerousness findings. But, despite many improvements and a data overhaul required by the Criminal Justice Reform Act, the state does not presently produce data on these sources of pretrial detention. 
While Massachusetts boasts both historically low crime rates and incarceration rates, the Commonwealth’s pretrial system is behind the times. And sheriffs’ budgets have generally increased—with much more spent on security staff than programs to help people get their lives on track after incarceration.  
Policymakers should follow the emerging evidence base in jurisdictions across the country to rein in the use of pretrial detention and cash bail. Spending even a few days in jail is associated with a greater likelihood of being arrested on a new charge or convicted of a new crime, indicating that pretrial incarceration impedes safety for all of us.  
Study after study in states as diverse as Texas, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey shows that curtailing the use of cash bail has positive outcomes, including fiscal and public safety benefits as well as enormous benefits for affected families. In this moment, it is critically important to reject rhetoric fueled by racism and fear and dig into the data to understand who benefits, and who suffers, when our public policy is based on tradition rather than evidence.  
Researchers consistently find severe consequences of cash bail and pretrial detention: loss of employment, greater housing instability, greater likelihood of conviction and a longer sentence to incarceration, the traumatic experience of parental separation for children of incarcerated parents, and decreases in the economic stability of whole families. And even in Massachusetts, the conditions of confinement where people are detained pretrial are indisputably punishing.  
In jail, people experience strip searches, public showers, open communal toilets, inedible food, rodent infestations, limited access to hygiene, crowded dorms or two-person cells the size of a parking space, lack of sleep, enforced idleness; sensory deprivation and sensory overload from constant noise, harsh lighting, and a lack of time outdoors; exposure to violence, punitive sanctions like solitary confinement that may constitute torture, inadequate medical care, and a heightened risk of premature death. And beyond this multitude of harms, evidence shows bail doesn’t even work: cash bail does not incentivize return to court.  
There is much left to do in Massachusetts to pursue a holistic community safety agenda. Whether on police accountability, violence reduction, or reducing prosecutions of misdemeanors that clog our criminal courts and impede public safety, a concerted effort is needed to continue to build a system that prioritizes justice, not punishment.  
The bar advocate counsel crisis has exposed new opportunities. The majority of cases dismissed against people who never received constitutionally guaranteed attorneys were low-level charges like trespass and drug possession, and yet still some 1,300 people were detained without counsel between May and October. While prosecutors should seriously scrutinize low-level cases to determine whether those prosecutions should be revived, in keeping with an emerging evidence base supporting misdemeanor non-prosecution as a public safety intervention, court actors across the board should also adjust their general approach to release and detention, having learned the rarity of serious pretrial violence even in cases where people typically would have been detained by bail.  
Now is a critical moment to confront conventional wisdom and politicized rhetoric that investing in public safety means investing in more jail for more people. There are better, more cost-effective policy interventions to achieve return to court: emerging research shows that text message reminders improve court appearance rates. Reforms in other jurisdictions have shown that people can be released at higher rates and continue to come back to court at even higher rates.  
In other words, rather than continuing to invest in ever-increasing sheriff budgets, policymakers would do well to build on these lessons in crafting a path forward. While the “gravy train” of sheriff budgets receive new scrutiny due to high-profile instances of alleged misconduct, the Legislature and the public should be equally concerned with the underlying policy goals of this spending: human caging, disproportionately of Black and Hispanic people who are presumed innocent. To achieve safe and thriving communities for all, relying less on pretrial jailing is an essential policy agenda.

(Photo courtesy of TVW)For Washington residents, getting help from state government could soon become easier and more secure, thanks in part to increased use of artificial intelligence.
Early next year, the state will launch the first public version of a new Resident Portal as part of a redesigned and expanded wa.gov. It will give people a single place to sign in and find and use online services across state agencies.
Officials say the goal is to save time, reduce frustration and make government work more like private sector sites like Amazon, but with public accountability at the center. 
In an interview on TVW’s “Inside Olympia,” Washington’s chief technology officer, Gretchen Peri, called the effort “an exercise in efficiency and effectiveness,” adding that government must “constantly look to strike” this balance on behalf of the public.
The rollout will be phased. 
A pilot completed this past June tested a personal profile, AI chatbots and tailored service recommendations, for things like professional license renewals, social services, cash benefits and assistance with employment, higher education and workforce training. 
A statewide rollout began the next month, with the first public version planned for early 2026 as the state retires its older Secure Access Washington login system. The state expects to add agencies and features through 2029.

The project builds on more than 25 years of digital government. Washington launched Access Washington in 1998, one of the nation’s first government web portals, to help people find services online. 
The new Resident Portal comes with technologies that help deliver on that original promise, with tools designed for cellphone users. Instead of navigating hundreds of agency sites and logins, residents will use a single connected system spanning more than 140 agencies.
Chief Privacy Officer Katy Ruckle, also appearing on “Inside Olympia,” told host Austin Jenkins the portal’s success depends on maintaining public trust. 
“Security is how we’re protecting the data,” she said. “Privacy is really thinking about the ‘what’— what data are we collecting, and for what reasons do we need it?” 
Her office has set new guardrails to ensure agencies limit what they collect and use it responsibly. She and Peri are developing a statewide framework to guide how agencies deploy automated tools, while aligning with the state’s privacy principles. 
In practice, they say responsible AI means using automated tools carefully and transparently, ensuring they serve the public good, protect privacy and include clear human oversight. The focus is fairness, accountability and limiting data use to specific, lawful purposes.
Some applications are straightforward: AI is already helping people navigate government. The Department of Licensing uses a public-facing chatbot named DOLLY on its website to answer customer questions. 
At the Department of Commerce, an internal chatbot pilot is making regulatory and compliance work more efficient, allowing expert staff to focus on more complex and substantive tasks instead of manually reviewing documents.
Ruckle said piloting and implementing chatbots is done with careful human supervision to ensure privacy, security and accuracy. Some applications raise fewer privacy questions, she said, such as AI trained to identify fish species from underwater video. Unlike people and their data, she noted, “the rockfish just doesn’t care.”
The portal’s evolution comes on the heels of an executive order from Gov. Bob Ferguson directing agencies to improve how they serve residents. 
“The time is right for us to actually understand where we are today, where we want to be, and then prioritize the initiatives that are going to get us there,” Peri said.

TUSCALOOSA — When Vanderbilt University football fan Douglas Dill set out with his son the morning of Oct. 4 to watch their team play rival University of Alabama, he didn’t expect his game-day experience to include a gurney ride to a medical facility inside Bryant-Denny Stadium.
But by the fourth quarter in Tuscaloosa, with the sun beating down on the upper decks, the 60-year-old needed medical help.
“It was smoking hot up there,” said Dill, who traveled from Nashville for the game. “The sun was burning me through my clothes. I needed to get up and get some fluids in me or I was going to go down big time. I was starting to get light headed.”

Dill, who operates a courier service with his wife, said he drank water throughout the day but he had none left by the middle of the fourth quarter. His son and a stadium paramedic helped him down the steep upper-deck stairs to where additional emergency medical personnel were waiting with the gurney.
Paramedics treated Dill for dehydration as well as low blood sugar and monitored his blood pressure, which had climbed above normal. Dill has type 2 diabetes but does not usually have high blood pressure. While Dill missed the end of the game, he recovered enough for his son to drive him home.
Dill is one of hundreds of fans who have fallen ill from extreme heat in recent years at college games in powerhouse stadiums in the Southeastern Conference. The SEC, a collegiate athletic association, represents programs across a dozen states and accounts for nine of the country’s 13 largest football stadiums.
ICN reviewed temperature studies of heat conditions at Auburn University, the University of Alabama and Mississippi State University, and collected its own temperature measurements during two games in October, one at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and the other at University of Alabama at Birmingham.
An Inside Climate News analysis of data from inside these southern stadiums found that temperatures can spike for hours, from 10 to 16 degrees Fahrenheit higher than outside heat, depending on the venue. Concrete surface temperatures in seating areas of the Tuscaloosa stadium measured over 130 degrees Fahrenheit.
Those high temperatures had consequences. Auburn University averaged well over 100 emergency calls per game in 2024, with the majority being heat-related. Halfway through the 2025 season, Alabama was averaging 60 to 65 medical calls per game, with 50 to 75 percent of calls during day games related to heat, according to interviews with medical personnel, though university officials provided lower numbers.

Auburn administrators said they are aware of excessive heat risks for spectators and are trying to enhance cooling efforts. University of Alabama officials said in a statement that “fan safety is a top priority” and that it aims to safeguard fans by providing cooling stations and emergency responders during games in Tuscaloosa.
The university informs spectators about the free water stations and first aid through websites, apps, social-media channels and in-stadium announcements from the public-address system and on video screens, the statement said. The University of Alabama at Birmingham, which has a stadium about half the size of Tuscaloosa’s arena, has also provided cooling stations.
Still, none of the universities have made changes that could make the biggest difference in lowering the potential for illness: shifting game times or the season itself. That would require a much greater degree of cooperation—particularly because of the financial consideration of big college football—across athletic conferences.
Medical professionals said that spectators need help in assessing heat risks and making safe choices on game days.
“People tend to really want to be there, and so they will endure perhaps more physical discomfort to stay there throughout the event than they would if they were just taking a walk or doing stuff on their own,” said Dr. Cheyenne Falat, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Maryland who specializes in weather-related and heat illnesses.
Another factor that likely affects fans’ ability to withstand heat is alcohol consumption. Auburn, University of Alabama and University of Alabama at Birmingham have recently allowed the sale of alcohol at games. Medical logs reveal that alcohol was a complicating factor at Auburn University for people treated for heat-related illnesses during games. Auburn began selling alcohol in 2024, the other schools in 2022.
As climate change intensifies, heat risks are likely to increase.
A federal government analysis of climate modelling predicts that by the 2040s, the average maximum daily temperature in Tuscaloosa, the home of the University of Alabama, will be 5 degrees Fahrenheit above the average registered from 1961 to 1990.
A researcher who has tracked heat risks at Auburn University’s Jordan-Hare Stadium—at 88,043 seats, second in capacity in the state only to the University of Alabama’s 101,821— said his ongoing work is aimed at crafting possibilities to alleviate potential harm.
“I don’t want to say it’s out of the realm of possibility, per se, but I would say in terms of solutions, I think we have to face the reality that we are, in fact, going to have [midday]  games,” said Brandon Ryan, an Auburn graduate researcher and teaching assistant in the department of geosciences. He’s been measuring in-stadium temperatures since 2023. “If that’s unavoidable, how do we tackle that problem?”

First responders busy

For a few months every year in Alabama, Saturdays are sacred. College football reigns as the king of sports across much of the South, and in this sun-drenched state, two fields hold dominion: the Alabama and Auburn gridirons.
But gathering to yell “Roll Tide” or “War Eagle” as teams compete in these massive concrete stadiums comes with costs. First responders at these universities increasingly spend days, and sometimes nights, rescuing football fans exposed to excessive heat.
Wes Michaels, emergency services coordinator at the University of Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium and a lieutenant with Tuscaloosa Fire Rescue, said 60 medical professionals were on hand for the Crimson Tide’s Oct. 4 game against Vanderbilt, with its capacity crowd.
“You think, man, 60 people, that’s a lot,” Michaels said. “I’ll tell you, with 100,000 people in here, it gets really, really busy. Everybody is doing something, tending to a patient.”
Researchers at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa raised an alarm 15 years ago about in-stadium heat. An Auburn University research team, led by Ryan, continues to study heat stress among fans on much-anticipated game days at Jordan-Hare.
Ryan knows about sacred Saturdays—especially the hot ones.
One of them came on Sept. 21, 2024, when Auburn played Arkansas.
Kickoff that day at Jordan-Hare was at 2:30 p.m. The high temperature at the university airport station was 88 degrees. The heat index, a measure of the “feels like” temperature that accounts for humidity, was around 90 degrees from noon through 5 p.m.
Inside Jordan-Hare, the 13th largest stadium in the United States, the temperature was much higher.
“It was brutal,” Ryan said.
Brandon Ryan, an Auburn Ph.D. student and graduate teaching assistant, holds a bachelor’s in atmospheric science and a master’s in geography. (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
He saw some fans in higher tiers leave their seats in search of shade in the stadium walkways. Many guzzled water. Others were less able to cope. Heat indices in the stadium, according to temperature sensors Ryan installed in seating sections across the facility, ranged from 97 to 114 degrees.
“They were literally dragging people out of the way,” Ryan said of medical personnel. He said his review of emergency service records found that first responders received 214 medical calls during that game, the majority of which were heat-related.
Ryan was not wholly surprised by the illnesses. He had been studying stadium heat for more than a year then, working with a faculty advisor and members of the university’s public safety team. Because of his ongoing research, Ryan has become the institution’s go-to expert on stadium heat, offering a scientific approach with a bit of a fan’s heart.
“I don’t want it to have to come to somebody dying, and maybe now we’re doing something about it,” Ryan said of his interest in stadium heat. “I don’t want it to be someone I know. I don’t want it to be one of my students.”
Ryan’s research conclusions and related recommendations have been shared with university officials and offer some sobering conclusions about game-day health risks.
Temperature and humidity observations measured throughout Jordan-Hare Stadium from 2023 to 2025 revealed that the heat index in the facility regularly reached 10 or more degrees above that measured outside its walls. During some games, heat indices inside the stadium, built in 1939, rose to over 100 degrees, according to Ryan’s research.
Ryan said that large sports stadiums like Jordan-Hare can trap excessive heat for several reasons. High-capacity stadiums pack in spectators, and people who sit for the average three-hour game may find themselves hostage to the sun. High humidity is also a problem, limiting the body’s natural cooling ability.
James Spann, chief meteorologist for the ABC affiliate in Birmingham, attends all the University of Alabama home games in Bryant-Denny Stadium as a weather advisor to coaches. Known for engaging live broadcasts during severe weather events and for focusing on weather-safety education, Spann helps spectators stay on top of the weather, too. He issues updates that are shared on the stadium’s large video screens.
Body heat adds to the thermal load inside the stadium, increasing air temperature by 2 to 5 degrees, Spann said. Artificial turf can heat up to 20 to 30 degrees hotter than the ambient air, he continued, and concrete and metal stands absorb and radiate heat.

And where a fan sits—in the sun or in the shade—can make a big difference, too, according to Spann. Seating areas in the sun in Bryant-Denny Stadium can be 10 to 15 degrees warmer than shaded areas, “so if you’ve got a day where it’s 90 degrees, it could be 105 in the sun,” he said.
Spann said fans know this, but seven of eight spectators randomly interviewed during the Oct. 4 game underestimated how hot it got inside the stadium, giving the day’s forecasted high in the mid-80s or a lower number. An Inside Climate News reporter measured temperatures as high as 96 degrees in the stadium that day.
Asked about whether the public and designers and operators of sports stadiums need to take rising maximum daily temperatures into consideration in their decision making, Spann referred such questions to Alabama’s state climatologist, John Christy, who notably rejects mainstream climate science. Christy has argued there is no causal link between CO2 emissions and a warming climate.
Even when weather conditions are overcast and breezy, as they were during University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Oct. 4 game against Army in Protective Stadium, a significant temperature difference can occur between inside and outside the stadium, which seats about 45,000 people.
That day, kickoff was at 11 a.m. and measurements taken by an Inside Climate News reporter that day recorded a difference in air temperatures of as much as 10 degrees—depending on sun exposure—even in a newer stadium. Protective Stadium opened in 2021.
Ryan said his data at Auburn’s Jordan-Hare Stadium shows that sun exposure has a clear and measurable impact on the relative comfort of a particular seat.
“Day games are extremely problematic,” Ryan said. “Night games, not as much.” Over three seasons of observations, Ryan said his measurements recorded heat index values exceeding 115 degrees at least once during both the 2023 and 2024 seasons, both on late September day games.
During that same two-year period, elevated temperatures inside the facility have led to more than a thousand heat-related medical calls to first responders, records show.
On the day of the 2024 Auburn-Arkansas game, Ryan said, sensors in seven of nine seating sections across Jordan-Hare measured “feels like” conditions above 103 degrees. Temperatures exceeding that are characterized as dangerous by experts, making “heat cramps or heat exhaustion likely, and heat stroke possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity,” according to the National Weather Service.



Ryan has also relied on data from Auburn university officials to collate his findings. In 2023, there were as many as 43 heat-related medical calls per game, university records showed.
Spectators at Jordan-Hare suffered heat-related illnesses including nosebleeds, seizures, dehydration and low blood sugar and complaints of feeling lightheaded and dizzy. Other fans called first responders for abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, heart palpitations and difficulty breathing.
By 2024, medical calls increased significantly inside the stadium, according to Ryan’s research.
First responders averaged 161 calls per game for a total of more than 805 calls at all home games, the majority of which were for heat or cardiac-related events, records revealed.
In the 2023 data set, of the 113 emergency calls attributed to heat-related illness, 44 involved individuals who fainted or were reportedly “about to faint.”
Numerous heat-related incidents reported inside Jordan-Hare included alcohol as a contributing factor, according to medical logs reviewed by ICN. Although the school did not begin to sell alcohol inside the stadium until the 2024 season, experts say alcohol use may have exacerbated the risk of heat-related illness.
Alcohol contributes to heat illness in two ways, said Falat, the University of Maryland expert on weather-related illnesses and the university hospital’s assistant medical director for the adult emergency department.
Alcohol dehydrates, she said, and dehydration is an initial stage of heat illness that can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Then, “as you drink more and more, your ability to recognize your symptoms becomes impaired … and that’s when we start to really, really enter that danger zone,” she said.
Spann, the meteorologist, said alcohol consumption during early-season day games at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa has proved to be a significant problem. “The worst thing you can do is drink a lot of alcohol on a hot day out there in the sun, and nothing good is going to come out of that,” he said.


The university challenge

Since 2023, Ryan has been submitting recommendations to Auburn University officials, outlining the empirical data from the research team and making policy suggestions aimed at mitigating health risks.
Ashley Gann, Auburn’s public information officer for campus safety and security and a meteorologist herself, said Ryan’s work “was incredibly valuable” and has helped administrators build a strategic heat plan.
“His work helped validate the importance of our existing heat plan and gave us the data we needed to refine it even further,” Gann said. “Thanks to Brandon’s study, we were able to concentrate resources in the areas of greatest need and engage in more strategic pre-planning for both football and baseball events. His contributions have strengthened our ability to protect fans and staff from heat-related risks.”

Earlier research at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa stands as a precursor to Ryan’s findings, which he is continuing to refine and plans to publish.
Fifteen years ago, researchers conducted a study similar to Ryan’s at Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium.
Barrett Gutter, now an assistant professor of meteorology at Virginia Tech, tracked temperature data in Bryant-Denny Stadium as part of his student research in 2009. The facility was constructed in 1929 and has been expanded multiple times.
Gutter collected readings at six locations inside the stadium during a game in October 2009 and compared them to temperatures recorded at the National Weather Service station at Tuscaloosa Regional Airport. He found “significantly warmer temperatures” at each location inside the stadium.
Temperatures in the concourse areas were up to 17 degrees higher than those at the airport, while temperatures at field level seating and in the upper decks were recorded 10.5 degrees and 13 degrees warmer, respectively.

Gutter’s study was conducted before a stadium expansion in 2010 that enclosed the south end zone and added an upper deck with about 9,000 seats. The stadium also added artificial turf sidelines in 2023. Gutter said in a recent interview that temperature differentials likely would be greater today.
“When you close in a stadium like they did, it really limits the amount of air flow and circulation you’re going to get in there,” he said. “You basically are just in a bowl, and so all of that heat has a harder time basically evacuating that stadium. When you have an open end zone, you have a way for that heat to escape.”
Gutter’s research provided some telling geographical detail about seating risks then. Field-level temperatures between 3:15 p.m. and 5 p.m. were about 6 degrees higher on the east side versus the west side of Bryant-Denny Stadium. The western section of the upper deck casts a shadow that gradually covers seating on the western side of the stadium during that time period, Gutter observed. The shadow cooled the temperature sensor in that location.
Gutter later pursued research on stadium heat at Mississippi State University, where he was a professor. Last year, he and three other researchers published a study in the journal Atmosphere that analyzed the impact of heat exposure on spectator health at Mississippi State’s Davis Wade Stadium.

The researchers deployed 50 sensors around the arena and measured temperature and humidity from August through November 2016. They compared that data with readings at a weather station near Mississippi State as well as first-aid and emergency medical data from the university’s office of emergency management.
“What I got out of that study, more so than anything, was, on a spatial and temporal scale, how much fluctuation you see even through a game, which is the influence of shade,” Gutter said.
Gutter said the Mississippi study solidified findings from the Bryant-Denny research. Heat-related illness comprised up to two-thirds of cases requiring first-aid at Mississippi State. The majority of heat-related incidents occurred in the most thermally oppressive parts of the stadium, according to the study.
The study concluded there was a need for greater monitoring of heat exposure inside stadiums, better education for spectators regarding heat-mitigation strategies, and stadium design modifications to improve circulation, increase shade and reduce crowding.
The search for water
On the day in October that Douglas Dill fell ill at the University of Alabama, a reporter for Inside Climate News recorded temperatures inside and outside Bryant-Denny Stadium. The readings were recorded from 12:08 p.m. to 4:55 p.m. and approximately every 30 minutes during the game. Air temperatures were measured using a probe thermometer, and an infrared thermometer was held above concrete and metal in seating areas to measure surface temperatures.
Temperatures were recorded on the eastern side of the stadium, where spectators were in direct sunlight for the entire game.
At 2:30 kickoff time, an air temperature reading in the upper deck of the stadium was 11 degrees warmer than the temperature recorded at the airport. Temperatures measured inside the stadium ranged from 85 degrees to 96 degrees.
Surface temperatures in the stadium were higher. Concrete registered as high as 130.8 degrees. Metal seats tested by ICN were up to 108.8 degrees.



The university, in a statement responding to ICN’s queries, said it provides 20 cooling stations—16 with free water and 11 with electric fans—inside the stadium to help spectators cope with the heat.
But ICN found that one of Bryant-Denny Stadium’s cooling stations needed help itself on that day.
During the second quarter, when long lines for water had formed at the Level 2 cooling station near the student section, the 150-gallon water tank there ran dry. No staff person was there to refill it, even though the station is one of seven that emergency medical personnel are supposed to staff, according to a university cooling station map.
Spectators aren’t allowed to bring water into the stadium. They are allowed to carry empty water bottles and fill them once inside.

On Oct. 4, graduate student Izzy Piper waited in the water line approximately 15 minutes and found the tank had run empty. “I’m in the student section. It’s just in the sun the entirety of an afternoon game, and I hate being hot,” Piper said, explaining her cooling station stop.
Shannon Coughlin, a student waiting behind Piper, noticed a hose connected to the empty water tank and eventually turned a knob that sent water flowing—to his relief and that of others in line.
Coughlin has type 1 diabetes and said he needs more than the average amount of fluids to avoid dehydration at football games.“I gotta drink water,” he said. “That’s why I come back to places like this [the cooling station]. When the sun is right on you, it’s murderous.”


The university did not respond to questions from Inside Climate News about the empty water tank or the long lines for free water.

Emergency calls

Emergency medical staff who operate a 10-bed first-aid facility at Bryant-Denny Stadium said on Oct. 4 they had received an average of 60 to 65 medical calls per game at that point in the 2025 season. Not all calls are heat-related. The percentage of heat calls depends on game time, temperature and time of year, according to Michaels.
“Heat is one of our biggest challenges we face,” Michaels said.
During the Oct. 4 game, 50 percent to 60 percent of calls were heat related, with most people suffering from heat exhaustion or fainting, said Michaels, who has worked as a first responder at the stadium since 2009. Problems slowed in the second half as shade spread over the western half of Bryant-Denny Stadium, he said.

On Sept. 13, during the Wisconsin-Alabama game that kicked off at 11 a.m., every bed and chair in the first-aid facility was occupied, Michaels said. The high temperature outside the stadium that day was 92 degrees.
There were more than 70 EMS calls during that game, and approximately 75 percent were heat related, Michaels said. “The Wisconsin game was very challenging as far as managing the heat-related stuff,” he said. “Crews did a really good job of getting people to where they needed to go, whether it be a cool zone, whether it be one of the first-aid rooms or whether it be the hospital.”
There have been games with as few as about 10 calls, he continued, and those are typically at night or late in the season.
Michaels said people planning to attend a game should know what the physical demands are and consider their health conditions. They should be aware, for instance, that they might have to walk a mile and half in the heat just to get to the stadium, then walk up spiral ramps and stairs to get to their seats, he said.
“That can be a lot,” he said. “Folks have to know their limitations.”
Other medical professionals said much the same, adding that people should wear ventilated clothing and shaded hats, use cooling rags and stand near fans when possible on hot days. Elderly people, young children and those with certain medical conditions or who are taking particular medications are especially vulnerable to heat risks.
Heat already kills more Americans than any other weather-related hazard, according to the National Weather Service, and climate change is leading to more frequent, intense and longer-lasting heat waves, Falat said.
“It’s absolutely expected that deaths and other complications from heat-related illnesses will rise as those events rise, but it is also an opportunity for us as a society to really increase our public health awareness of these events, because the statistics don’t have to follow suit,” she said.
Dr. William Barton, assistant medical director of the emergency department at DCH Regional Medical Center, located two miles from Bryant-Denny Stadium, said the football season also affects his emergency department. Between 50 and 100 people are treated at the stadium’s first-aid facility during some games, he said. Paramedics send an average of 10 to 20 people per game over to the medical center’s emergency room, Barton said, and the majority are experiencing heat-related illness.
The university provided far lower numbers of illness to Inside Climate News.
“So far this season, EMS has responded to 18 heat-related calls during three home football games,” according to the university statement dated Oct. 10. “Last season, EMS responded to 26 heat-related calls during seven home games. During the past two seasons, two fans were transported to the hospital for heat-related illness.”
“Hydration is the big thing,” Barton said. “That’s where most people run into trouble. Your skin does what’s called evaporative cooling, and in the process of that, you lose a lot of fluids from your body. You are going to find yourself in a position where you’re becoming dehydrated, and you really didn’t know that you were.”

Minor changes, major stakes

Universities are making some headway in addressing heat risks in their football stadiums.
The University of Alabama added cooling stations a decade ago, and that has made a difference, Michaels said. “Before those cooling stations were installed, it was nothing to have 100 calls in a ball game,” he said about Bryant-Denny Stadium. “And when the university invested the resources to permit those cooling stations, it drastically affected the call volume.”
Both Gutter and Ryan said that there are other small steps that universities can take such as improving air circulation, creating more shaded areas in the stadiums, increasing access to cooling stations and improving education about heat-related illness.
Decisions that could limit the most risk, experts said—banning midday games during warmer months, enclosing stadiums or building climate-controlled facilities, and even shifting the football season to later in the year—do not seem likely.
The college sports schedule is part of an economic engine that few universities can individually challenge. Given the culture of sports in the United States, shifting seasons isn’t easily done, Gutter said, but moving game times may be possible.
“If I had a magic wand, I wouldn’t play games in August and September, in the Southeast, in the midday or afternoon,” he said. “I would wait to play them in the evening. As you’re transitioning to fall and more into winter, shift those games more into the later afternoon,” to protect fans from the cold.

Ryan isn’t optimistic that kickoffs will be pushed to later in the day.
“If we could do everything after four o’clock or later, for example, that would be great,” he said. “But in terms of practicality or actuality—probably not going to happen.”
Global sports have begun to adapt to the realities of a warming climate, Ryan said, and some leagues may be setting an example for U.S. athletics.
“FIFA had to change the way they did the World Cup,” Ryan said. “We even saw it with the Paris Olympics. If the Olympics are having to think about this sort of stuff, we’re probably gonna have to think about these things too.”
Heat-related deaths, Ryan said, are ultimately avoidable.
“I care about this university a lot. I care about my students a lot. I want them to come to the game to watch the game, and I don’t want them to worry about their grandma passing out,” he said.
Douglas Dill doesn’t regret his day at Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium. His team lost, 30-14. But he said Vanderbilt played a good game and his heat-illness episode won’t deter him from witnessing future ones.
“I love football, and nothing will keep me away from it,” Dill said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bryant-Denny-Stadium-for-Nov-21-2025-story-1024x637.jpg,,,2025-11-22 08:56:52.442638

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Whether or not she’s a baseball fan, South Dakota Secretary of State Monae Johnson finds herself living one of Yogi Berra’s famous sayings: “It’s deja vu all over again.”
The New York Yankees’ catcher didn’t have Johnson in mind when he said it, but her future bears a remarkable resemblance to her past.
In the summer, Johnson will find herself fighting for her job at the state Republican Party convention where some nominees for statewide office are chosen. She’s being challenged by state Rep. Heather Baxter, a Republican from Rapid City.
Former state trooper plans run as Democrat for secretary of state

In a South Dakota Public Broadcasting story about her candidacy, Baxter said she would align herself with President Donald Trump’s platform on election reform. Trump’s platform isn’t about fair play at the ballot box so much as it’s about poor sportsmanship. That can be seen in his reaction to the recent passage of Proposition 50 in California. Without evidence, Trump has decried that election as rigged. Now it will be up to various “election integrity” groups to offer conspiracy theories about shadowy forces behind the scenes that are as nefarious as they are unidentifiable.
Four years ago, it was Johnson who did the challenging at the convention, calling out incumbent Secretary of State Steve Barnett for not caring enough about the integrity of South Dakota elections. Johnson was successful and has to hope that history doesn’t repeat itself at the next GOP convention.
Johnson got some of her support at the 2022 convention from election integrity enthusiasts who took their cue from Trump’s assertions that the 2020 election was somehow rigged against him. By their tortured logic, even elections in states like South Dakota that voted heavily for Trump need to be cleaned up.
After Johnson’s election, the integrity crowd expected her to act like a fox in the henhouse, exposing all the corruption that was surely hiding behind every voting machine. Instead she started acting like, well, a secretary of state. So far on Johnson’s watch, what South Dakota’s elections have lacked in drama they have made up for in professionalism.
This has caused Johnson to run afoul of groups like the Luddites in the South Dakota Canvassing Group. They want to go back to the good old days when men were men and paper ballots were counted by hand.
Unfortunately for her, Johnson has other problems beyond the fight for her job. She was recently subpoenaed to appear before the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee.
Usually elected officials will just show up when asked to testify to legislators. The committee issued the subpoena because it said Johnson had failed to show up to testify in the past.

Johnson said she had informed the committee she was conducting county auditor training on the day the committee wanted her to show up. Committee members wanted Johnson to answer questions about the methods used for purchasing new election technology and whether the purchase was subject to the bidding process.
Johnson should probably avoid making legislators — who control her budget — as surly as the election integrity buffs. Lucky for her, the South Dakota Canvassing Group doesn’t have subpoena power.
It wouldn’t be out of character for Johnson to avoid public scrutiny. One of the first official actions she took as secretary of state was forming a 15-member group to discuss election audits and draft legislation. The topic was so important that Johnson announced the meetings would be held behind closed doors.
Fresh off a campaign in which she pledged to bring greater transparency to elections, the irony-impaired Johnson held her committee meetings in secret to discuss election integrity.
As Johnson deals with irritated legislators and an attempt to kick her out of her job at the next GOP convention, she might start quoting another saying from Yogi Berra: “The future ain’t what it used to be.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-22 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Under new EPA rule, protections would dry up for wetlands across the Mississippi River basin","Madeline Heim, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Cassandra Stephenson, Tennessee Lookout, Elise Plunk, Louisiana Illuminator and Phillip Powell, Arkansas Times",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/22/epa-rule-wetlands-protections/,A proposed new EPA rule is the latest in a decades-long fight over which streams and wetlands qualify as “Waters of the United States” and thus are regulated by the federal government.,"Many acres of wetlands across the vast Mississippi River basin would lose federal protection under a new rule proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Agricultural and builders’ groups have called it a win for private property owners. Environmental groups warn that it will exacerbate costly challenges like flooding that already plague the river and its tributaries. 
The new rule, proposed Monday, is the latest in a convoluted, decades-long fight over which streams and wetlands qualify as “Waters of the United States” and thus are regulated by the federal government under the Clean Water Act. Environmental advocates claim more expansive federal protections are needed to preserve the country’s natural resources, while some farmers and homebuilders argue the government is overstepping its authority to control how they use their land. 
A landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court case, Sackett v. EPA, used a narrow definition to determine which wetlands get federal protections. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin promised earlier this year that the agency would adjust its definitions to comply. The proposed rule delivers on that promise.
The proposal will be open for public comment for 45 days before it moves forward.
Wetland advocates are still parsing details of the proposal but say they’re concerned with the impacts it could have. 
“This does not help any of the issues the basin is facing,” said Kelly McGinnis, executive director of One Mississippi, a group that advocates for the river. “Whether we’re talking water quality and pollution, trying to mitigate the impact of the more frequent floods and droughts we’re seeing — removing even more wetland protections … is devastating.” 
States along Mississippi River have varied wetlands protections 
In Sackett v. EPA, a couple asked the Supreme Court to restrict federal regulations of wetlands so they could build a home on their northern Idaho property. The court ruled in their favor, saying only wetlands that have a continuous surface connection with another r protected water body — such as a permanent, navigable waterway — qualify for protections under the Clean Water Act. 
The Clean Water Act protects the “Waters of the United States” but it does not define them. That has fallen to the EPA, which has changed its definition repeatedly since the law’s passing in 1972. The murkiness and scope of the definitions has long frustrated stakeholders. 
In a news release, Zeldin said the new EPA rule follows the Sackett decision closely, granting protections only to wetlands that touch another protected water body and have visible water for at least part of the year.
Experts say a wetland is doing work even if it doesn’t usually have water in it or is isolated. The benefits of wetlands lie in their ability to relieve flooding, purify water, mitigate drought and provide wildlife habitat. Experts say in an era of increased storms, droughts and floods wrought by climate change, they’re needed now more than ever. 
Many groups have attempted to predict how many wetlands will lose protections following the Sackett decision, but the actual impact is yet to be understood. What is clear is that with more limited federal regulation, states will have different rules governing wetlands. 
Along the Mississippi River, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Tennessee and Mississippi have wetland protections that go beyond the Clean Water Act, a Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk analysis found.  Mississippi, which has 4 million acres of wetlands, protects these areas beyond the federal progam with state laws, such as the Coastal Wetland Protection, which specially targets coastal areas. 
Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas do not have more protective wetland laws on the books. Louisiana extends state protections to its coastal wetlands, but not inland ones.
And state laws are still moving targets. Tennessee lawmakers, for example, voted this year to roll back protections that had been in place since the 1970s requiring developers and landowners to seek state permission and pay for mitigation before draining or altering isolated wetlands. In Illinois, where researchers have estimated about 72% of the state’s remaining wetlands could lose federal protections under Sackett, lawmakers have drafted legislation beefing up their state’s regulations, though they have not passed it, yet.
There are also unanswered questions about how the Sackett decision would affect areas along the Mississippi and other rivers where the river’s main channel is separated from the floodplain by built levees — a concern Justice Brett Kavanaugh mentioned directly in his concurring opinion on the case. 
Wetland-rich Louisiana, in particular, relies on manmade flood control structures to try and hold back floodwaters from low-lying communities. State legislation passed in 2025 made wetland areas behind levees ineligible for state protection. 
Should those areas lose federal protection, it opens them up to “a ton of risky development,” said Haley Gentry, assistant director at the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy in New Orleans. 
“The reason to not build in a wetland shouldn’t have been, ‘Oh, you have to get this pesky federal permit,’” Gentry said. “It’s that wetlands flood … this is not creating more affordable housing, if you’re building risky homes in flood zones.” 
Mississippi River basin wetlands are already in trouble 
Groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Association of Manufacturers, whose members faced the potential of hefty fines if they altered federally regulated wetlands, have reacted positively to Zeldin’s proposed rule. 
The groups have complained that the previous definition, which was published in early 2023 and protected a broader swath of wetlands, left farmers confused about things like what constitutes a continuous surface connection between a wetland and a water body, said Courtney Briggs, senior director of government affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
“The fact that this administration has come in and given definitions to those terms already improves the situation significantly,” Briggs said. “It gives our farmers more confidence in using their own land.” 
Environmental groups, however, say that there will be consequences of the administration’s effort to make it easier for people to drain and fill wetlands for their own purposes. 
“They have, in this rule-making, completely ignored the costs of fewer wetlands and more polluted water to communities around the country,” said Mark Sabath, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.
In Mississippi, protecting wetlands is at the heart of the fight against the  Yazoo Pumps, a flood relief project that the U.S Army Corps of Engineers has touted for decades. The project now also has the backing of the Environmental Protection Agency, whose veto killed a previous iteration in 2008 because of the pumps’ potential to harm 67,000 acres of valuable wetland habitat. In a Jan. 8 letter, the EPA wrote that proposed mitigation components are “expected to reduce adverse effects to an acceptable level.” 
However conservationists, including a group of former EPA employees, are not convinced. 
The Mississippi River basin is home to many different types of wetlands, from Minnesota’s peatlands to the swamps of the Gulf South. In some places, they carry economic benefits of their own — like in Arkansas, where they provide crucial habitat for waterfowl that hunters spend big money to shoot. 
According to data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 132,000 acres of wetland across the basin were lost between 2009 and 2019, the equivalent of about 100,000 football fields. 
The last time EPA was reworking its definition of the“Waters of the United States,” in 2022, the  Mississippi River Collaborative, a consortium of environmental groups focused on the river,  wrote that the link between continued destruction of wetlands and increased nutrient pollution, a persistent problem for the Mississippi River, “is very clear.” 
“One cannot protect waters like the Illinois, Mississippi, and Ohio Rivers and the Gulf of Mexico without protecting wetlands and small streams,” they wrote.

This is Stories From The States. I’m Chris Fitzsimon. Here at States Newsroom, we know there’s a lot going on around the country every week, in every state. This week, we’re talking about mid-decade redistricting. Texas and California have grabbed most of the headlines in the battle. Now, GOP led states like Indiana are facing pressure from the president to redistrict. All while some states like Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Utah already have enacted new maps for the 2026 midterm elections. But Utah’s case is unique. That redistricting fight was spearheaded by Utah voters who ultimately won. Firstm that’s where we’re heading, and we’ll hear from one of the plaintiffs in the case.
Katharine Biele  
All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Then we’ll check in with the Brennan Center for Justice to find out if all this mid-decade redistricting business is actually normal. Up first is a Utah News Dispatch reporter. We’ll hear from her in just a moment.
Chris Fitzsimon  
A Utah judge recently approved a redistricting map that would give Democratic candidates a good chance at winning one of the state’s US House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. This redistricting dispute started back in 2018 though, way before the Trump administration started pushing for mid-decade redistricting to rig the maps to try to keep control of the US House in 2026. Katie McKellar, a senior reporter from the Utah News Dispatch, has been closely covering this for years. She joins us now. Hi, Katie.
Katie McKellar  
Hi. Thanks for having me.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thanks for being with us. All right, let’s jump in. Tell us about this. This case, it nowhere near started just this year. Give us a little bit of background on what’s at stake here.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, there’s a long history here in Utah. So back in 2021, that year, the Republican majority Utah legislature repealed and replaced a ballot initiative that was narrowly approved by Utah voters in 2018. And that ballot initiative  driven by anti gerrymandering groups called Better Boundaries, sought to implement an independent redistricting process here in Utah, meant to guard against gerrymandering, and they argued that there were too many Democratic, independent and even more moderate Republican voters here that were being dispersed or cracked through the redistricting process. And so they put Proposition 4 on the ballot for voters to decide whether it should become law, and it passed. But Republican leaders here have long believed that they have the final say when it comes to ballot initiatives, and so they repealed and replaced Prop Four with a law known as SB 200 and essentially, what that law did was water down Prop Four and turn the independent redistricting commission that was supposed to draw the state’s maps into an advisory body that could ignore those maps.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So basically, the voters decided they wanted to do this with the independent commission. The Republican legislature said, ‘No, thanks’. We’re going to turn this into an advisory commission, even though the voters didn’t want that?
Katie McKellar  
Exactly, exactly. And so instead, they repealed and replaced that law with one that that turned into an advisory body that they could ignore. And so even though that independent commission drew a set of maps that year, lawmakers do their own and they adopted those maps and that congressional map and that set created four solidly Republican congressional districts, and that prompted pro democracy groups like the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who felt disenfranchised by that new congressional map to get together and sue. And they alleged that that 2021 map was a blatant gerrymander, and that lawmakers violated their rights to reform their government through a ballot initiative.
Chris Fitzsimon
So really, the lawsuit was about the ballot initiative as much as it was the districts. Sounds like.
Katie McKellar  
Absolutely it was about both. It was about gerrymandering and lawmakers overstepping on a ballot initiative. And so after that case spent several years winding through the courts. Ultimately, the Utah Supreme Court, on an appeal, sided with the plaintiffs on the claim that lawmakers violated their right to alter and reform their government, and that led a district court judge to deem the 2021 map the result of an unconstitutional process. So she didn’t rule, she didn’t weigh in on whether it was a gerrymander, but she did say it was an unlawful map because it was the result of repealing and replacing a ballot initiative. And so she she voided that 2021 map and ruled that Utah must go through a court ordered redistricting process to put in place a lawful congressional map to be used next year in the 2026 elections, and that’s how we got where we are today.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thank you. It’s not a simple topic. I think you did a great job explaining it for us. And so tell us when the Trump administration got involved and people thought that they were going to have some role in this.
Katie McKellar  
So while mid, mid decade redistricting is is a debate happening all over the country right now, Utah’s mid-decade redistricting process right now is unique, because this was court ordered this was a judge saying Utah lawmakers overstepped, we need to fix it. And so it’s very unique compared to the other conversations happening in states like California and Texas.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Right. And so now tell us what happened. The map that was chosen does appear to give Democrats a chance at winning one of these districts. From what I’ve read, a lot of this revolves around Salt Lake County, which is the most populous county in the state.
Katie McKellar  
Yeah, so over the last several a couple of months, really, this court ordered process took a long time. The judge took several weeks to hear from both sides, the legislative attorneys and attorneys for the plaintiffs and each side. She gave an opportunity to submit some maps to consider. So the legislature voted on a map known as map C that lawmakers contended abided by Proposition Four’s criteria, and that would be fair. And you know, looking at that map compared to the 2021 map, it is true that it was a bit more competitive for Democrats, but it would still result in four pretty solidly red congressional districts, and then the plaintiff submitted two options. One map was a lease change map based off of the map that the lawmakers approved to just kind of tweak the boundary so it didn’t split as many cities. Or they also submitted another one that was drawn with an algorithm that was created based off of Proposition Four’s criteria, and that map is the one the judge ultimately picked. And in that map, there’s the first congressional district is concentrated around the northern part of Salt Lake County, which is a very populated part of Utah. And the result is three pretty, like, really safe Republican districts, and one pretty safe Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon
Somebody described to me that the old maps that they were under and some of the proposals that weren’t adopted look like a pizza cutter had done them that they divided up most of the population into into pizza slices so the Republicans could maintain control.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, that has been a strategy for a long time. And you know, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit alleged was blatant gerrymandering Republicans here, they like to describe it as pizza slice, or mixing urban and rural voices, so that urban and rural voices in each district are represented on the federal level. Well, the plaintiffs allege, you know, that’s just cover to crack Salt Lake County into four different pieces so that there would not be a Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction there, when the court chose the map that gives the Democrats a chance to claim one of the districts?
Katie McKellar  
Oh, the the plaintiffs in the case were thrilled. They thought that was a great win, because that map, to them, was based wholly off of Propositions Four’s criteria. Democrats were thrilled, Republicans were angry. There’s been a ton of backlash from Republicans. I mean, even before the judge picked that map, some Republican lawmakers began saying, if she didn’t pick their map that they submitted to the court map see that they would argue it would amount to malfeasance, because they still firmly believe, despite all the court rulings, that the Utah constitution ultimately gives them and only them, the ability to pick maps in the redistricting process. And so couple of things have been happening. Republicans and a group called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing another ballot initiative to repeal Proposition Four to go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to consider. And in the meantime, I think we can still expect plenty of court appeals, legislative attorneys saying they’ll be willing to take it all the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary. But you know, barring some crazy upset, because we’ve already hit the deadline for a map to be used in 2026 even if they went on appeal. I don’t know if there’s even time to put a different map in place for 2026 but 2028 who knows? We’ll just have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon  
The judge has been attacked, right? And there’s even been like talks of impeaching the judge. It really has gone to a new level it seems like.
Katie McKellar
We’ll have to see if those threats are just threats, or if, if lawmakers actually try to carry that out. One lawmaker has said he’s open a bill file to do articles of impeachment, but I haven’t been able to get the senate president or the house speaker on record solidly saying yes, we’re going to try to impeach her, so we’ll have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon
Right. Well, we will check back with you. Katie, thanks for all your great reporting there, and thanks for being with us. Thanks. Chris. Katie McKellar is a senior reporter at the Utah News Dispatch. That outlet is a part of state’s newsroom. Since chatting with Katie, the Utah judiciary has issued a statement addressing threats to Judge Diana Gibson, who ruled on the maps. They addressed the heated political reaction as well as the threats of violence to Judge Gibson saying, “threats of violence against judges or court personnel are unacceptable, dangerous and may violate state of federal laws”. As Katie mentioned, the approved map drawn by the plaintiffs of Utah’s redistricting lawsuit was a collective effort of nonpartisan groups, faith based organizations, a legal center, and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who all said they just wanted fair maps. In a moment, we’ll meet one of the plaintiffs from that case. We’ll be right back.

After almost seven years of a legal battle against a GOP led state legislature in Utah, a broad coalition of plaintiffs finally had their congressional district map approved by federal judge. It wasn’t easy, and has involved a referendum that lawmakers ignored, legal machinations and now calls to impeach a judge. Joining us now with one of the people who was part of this redistricting fight, Katharine Biele is the President of the League of Women Voters of Utah. She joins us now. Hello, Katharine. Thanks for being here.
Katharine Biele  
Thank you so much Chris.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So Katharine, your group was one of the plaintiffs in this case, and now a judge has approved the maps you and other Utahns had sought, right.
Katharine Biele  
They did. I mean, we were thrilled.
Chris Fitzsimon
You were thrilled. I was gonna ask your reaction. Were you surprised?
Katharine Biele  
Not completely. We had very good arguments. I mean, our arguments were based in the Utah State Constitution, Article One, Section two, which gives the citizens the right to change the form of government. So we had a very good argument. We were never trying to leave the legislature out of it. We totally expect the legislature to draw the maps. All we require is that they draw them fairly.
Chris Fitzsimon
Just to be clear, the maps that had been drawn or that were drawn by the General Assembly, or the ones that they were were promoting, really, I always hear it as an outsider to Utah, hear it described as like pizza slices, which keeps sort of all the parts of Salt Lake City separated in effect.
Katharine Biele
And it’s not just Salt Lake City, but Salt Lake Salt Lake County. This is where the hub of the population lives. They divided the county into four slices going down to the very tip of Southern Utah, St George, so we in urban Salt Lake have the same representative as those down in southern Utah.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction from the legislature and the proponents, or the I guess the people who wanted to continue to draw the maps the way they had been drawn.
Katharine Biele  
The legislature is up in arms. They will not stop this should have been easy. I mean, how hard is it to draw a fair map? It’s not a partisan thing. It is. Just look, this is these are communities of interest. Salt Lake County is one community of interest. Southern Utah is another. The rural, rural areas are another. So it’s just really not that hard. They were furious because they thought we were taking away their responsibility, which we are not.
Chris Fitzsimon  
You know, Utah has a reputation, I think, from afar, and I think I’m sure it feels that way a lot of times in Utah you have Republican governors in the past have reached across the aisle. There’s been a lot of national publicity. They’ve been the leaders in sort of a different kind of campaigning. So I think there’s a perception that politics in Utah hasn’t gotten to the bitter level that we’ve seen around the country. And yet it feels like in this case, maybe that has changed some.
Katharine Biele  
I will say that it may be changing a little. This is all based around the national politics and the kind of national politics that are coming down to Utah. There are many people here, many legislators who think that whatever Trump says and whatever he does, they should do however. We also have enough. I mean, we respect the legislature, and the legislators do have good intentions. They just have to get away from the whole idea that only Republicans can be in charge of everything.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Do you have trouble as a citizen activist or a member of an organization, getting some voters to understand really what’s at stake. I think sometimes, even when I’m talking to folks about redistricting battles, and we’ve had a lot of them in states that I’ve been in, people sometimes their eyes glaze over and they want to talk about a lot of other issues. But this feels like a in some cases, a technical thing.
Katharine Biele  
Well, and this is it’s hard, it is very difficult, and I think the legislature has made it even. More difficult on purpose. They want the citizens to be confused and to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to leave it to the legislature, because we don’t get it.’ It’s not that hard. All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter. We don’t all win. We just need to have a voice. I have heard as a league of women voters. We register voters all the time. What they say to us is, why should we vote? We know what the outcome will be. This at least gives those voters a chance. Is it over? No, it probably will never be over. I mean, the legislature has talked about appealing. You know, if they appeal to the Supreme Court, that is really a delaying tactic, because our Supreme Court ruled unanimously in our favor. So it’s unlikely that they would do anything different. But I can’t say I’m not a lawyer. They have talked about running an initiative, which is ironic, a citizens initiative to overturn a citizens initiative. And that is exactly what you said. It’s because people are confused, and they think, Oh, well, we can confuse them more, and they will just vote our way to get rid of Proposition Four.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Well, I really appreciate you being with us, and thanks for all your efforts for democracy there in Utah. Thank you very much.
Katharine Biele
Thank you too.

This week, a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 2026 election. Texas was the first state pushed by the President to take part in this unusual mid-decade redistricting scheme. This move has led state lawmakers across the country to talk about redistricting when they only discuss it every 10 years. Is all this mid decade redistricting now going to be the new normal nationally? Coming up, an expert from the Brennan Center for Justice will help us figure that out. Then Evening Wrap newsletter author Danielle Gaines will join us about the story she’s looking out for. We’ll be right back.

Congressional district maps are generally redrawn every decade after the US Census, unless a court intervenes and orders state lawmakers to redraw them to settle a lawsuit. But the Trump administration has been pushing GOP led states to redistrict this year, purely for political reasons, to make it harder for Democrats to take over control of the House in the 2026 election. What are the long term effects of the break from precedent, and what happens if it becomes the new normal and maps are drawn every two years instead of every 10? We spoke with Kareem Crayton. He’s the vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Washington DC office, and he has a doctorate in political science. Just a note. We spoke with Kareem before the news broke in Texas this week where a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 26th election. Now they have to go back to their 2021 maps, which, by the way, are already gerrymandered by the Republican controlled General Assembly. He joins us now, Kareem, thanks for being here. Delight to be with you. Thank you. Well, what do you make of this overall? I think if we were sitting here a year ago, it’s hard to imagine the pressure being brought on so many states to dramatically change the way they draw district lines.
Kareem Crayton
Yeah, about a year ago, I think most of us thought that the only movement was going to be in the courts, with things that were already on the table. I think it is hard to have predicted such a massive number of states jumping into the pool and that most of the disruption and chaos is coming really at the instigation of the White House.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It puts a good government advocates like folks at the Brennan Center in a bit of a tough place at the beginning of all this national mid-decade redistricting discourse, after Governor Greg Abbott announced that he was doing that in Texas, there was a lot of discussion about, should states that have commissions or states that are committed to trying to drawing on gerrymandered districts also play what did you make of that sort of the machinations there?
Kareem Crayton  
Well, I would say the tough position that we’ve been in is actually one that preceded Governor Abbott’s move, and it is where the Supreme Court of the United States failed to adopt a national standard. In the absence of that, notwithstanding the fact that the Supreme Court said it had no particular opinion about political gerrymandering, number of states saw that as an invitation. And I think what we’re seeing is the result of that. So both. For what Texas has done, and California and other states have done, in reaction, is in some ways not surprising, if also quite lamentable.
Chris Fitzsimon  
To have a legislature, for example, Texas, who already gerrymandered the districts with their own majority come back and, in effect, re gerrymander them. Is this? What is this unprecedented? Had you seen anything like this before?
Kareem Crayton  
I think, writ large, it is unprecedented. It is fair to say that states have gone back to the well in the past, first time where we’ve seen, you know, the legislature in Texas at least go back and say, Oh, we didn’t gerrymander enough. And certainly, when you add to that, the National reaction where some states are going back to say, the public, we want to do a re gerrymandering of this state, is that okay, in light of all the other things that you’ve seen, and in California, the people said, Yes,
Chris Fitzsimon  
I covered redistricting in North Carolina for a long time. And what do you make of this? For the voters? I think it’s already sort of hard to explain to folks who don’t do this for a living, who are just living their lives trying to make ends meet, and now they can’t vote for the person they used to their districts are different. How do you communicate this effectively, the importance of this to folks who aren’t really involved in the political process.
Kareem Crayton  
The people that are supposed to be served by the redrawing of districts are the people who are supposed to be represented, and those are voters, and not the electeds. And what you see with these changes, in the absence of a national standard is that people who live right next to each other, who share the same city, who understand the same sets of issues that affect them all are now divided by essentially arbitrary lines, and they’re done really for no other purpose than to serve a political interest, and in fact, an interest that might not even be in the state that’s supposed to be represented. So I think all of these, you know, line drawing and re line drawing efforts are bringing people farther and farther away from power and democratic system. People aren’t supposed to be, particularly in elections, the source of power, and that’s of real concern.
Chris Fitzsimon  
We also had some news recently from the Indiana Capitol Chronicle, despite visits from the vice president and pressure from the president, many Republicans there are choosing not to participate in this mid cycle redistricting.
Kareem Crayton
Well, we’re seeing a lot of folks, I think, look at this and say, one, what does it cost us to try to do this? Yes, maybe the White House really wants us to do it, but what do we lose by going back to the will and redrawing the map? And frankly, it is probably not off of anybody’s mind. The fact that we had elections in November that I think, surprised a lot of people. And so if you’re doing these redraws, you’ve got to think about the world, not just as it exists right now, but what it’s going to look like a year from now and beyond. And in places where, if you’re a Republican you’re looking at, you know, what was pretty much a clean sweep behind the Democratic Party. And you got to wonder, is there a line at which and pardon the pun, but yes, if you cross that line in drawing new district maps, do you make yourself less likely in a democratic wave year to be competitive? Again? This is sort of done from the perspective of partisanship. But what is lost in all of this is the people ultimately are going to want to choose. And I think the real challenge that a lot of people are grappling with is, well, look, we might want a certain political outcome, but if the public overwhelmingly sees us as grabbing more power than we’re due, it might be that there’s a wave so big that we can’t gerrymander our way out of it.
Chris Fitzsimon
You mentioned a national standard. Is there some, some world, ideal world, where all this publicity and frustration leads us back to a conversation about how everybody should do redistricting in some fair and open and honest way?
Kareem Crayton
Well, I certainly hope so. The Congress of the United States still has the ability to say to the public, you know what? We hear you. And there should be a national standard, and we’re going to carve one. To carve one out that might not be true, that may or may not be true of this existing Congress, but the public is frustrated enough. It’s entirely possible that, you know, the public votes for people who will step into the breach. And by the way, it’s important to note you now hear both Republicans and Democrats, often, many of them on the losing end of a redistricting fight. Say, though there should be a national standard. So I think the more that becomes, as you point out, a priority for the public as a whole, but also for the elected to recognize. You know, in the main, this may or may not be a matter of whether or not I gain from a particular line drop, or whether the country gains overall from a system that makes sure that people at the forefront of how districts get drawn
Chris Fitzsimon
Well more to come, for sure. Dr Crayton, thank you very much for being with us. We appreciate your insights.

Coming up. We’ll check with evening rap newsletter writer Danielle Gaines, stay with us.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Joining us now is Danielle Gaines. She writes States Newsrooms, daily newsletter called The Evening Wrap Danielle, it’s great to see you. Let’s let’s jump in. Talk about the big things this week and what’s coming up. First of all. What big stories Did you notice this week?
Danielle Gaines
Well, we’ve had some coverage about the changes that are coming to programs in the United States who have typically assisted refugees when they arrive here, and so our reporter in Rhode Island spent some time at the refugee Dream Center there, and she was talking with women in a class that’s meant to improve their English skills, but it’s also about so much more for them. So it’s like cultural, emotional, social. It was a really beautiful story just getting to know the women, but it also kind of touched on the fact that this was a place that is meant to be filled with love help these people feel at home, and instead, a lot of the emotion there has been replaced with fear, which is all too familiar to this group of people and uncertainty the folks who go there are among hundreds of 1000s of lawful immigrants who will soon lose food benefits in the US, as provisions of the one big, beautiful Bill act take effect. And in addition to food benefits, there are other things coming up that are big changes for programs that we established to help people get on their feet so the work requirements and Medicaid are going to be a problem. These are folks who aren’t working because they’re trying to gain proficiency in English so they can work, and they’ll lose support during that process. The story also had an economic analysis of refugees and immigrants in Rhode Island that I found really interesting. So 15% of the state are immigrants, and $5.5 million in annual food benefits will be gone under these provisions, and soon child tax credits will be gone as well, to the tune of $30 million so it’s a big shift on a family level, but also, you know, on a state economic level,
Chris Fitzsimon  
Yeah, I think that bill still feels like it’s hanging over so many people. When the when those provisions take effect?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, one of the coordinators there said that’s going to be, quote, disastrous, once it all kind of takes shape together.
Chris Fitzsimon
What about coming up next? What about things to look for?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, so this week, I’ve been featuring a special mini series from our reproductive rights reporting team on the state of state shield protections for abortion medications. And so there’s a lot that has been going on with that, and a lot that is going to be going on with that. So over the series of stories, our team looked at the status of state shield laws as well as efforts to puncture them, as well as challenges to mifepristone in lawsuits and the federal regulatory level. So there is an ongoing lawsuit related to the federal regulations The ACLU is seeking information, kind of just looking at what is the Trump administration’s FDA actually looking at with these long established medications, and who are they talking to as they’re looking at it. So that’s a lawsuit to be on the lookout for. And then on the state side of things, shield laws that protect abortion providers have been established in lots of states to protect them from out of state lawsuits, but a new bill is taking effect in Texas, and that aims to kind of puncture the durability of those laws. It’s was described as the first bill in the country to explicitly target shield laws and shield providers, and it gives any Texan the power to sue anyone involved in mailing an abortion pill to the state. So we’ll have to see what unfolds there.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It seems like then, I mean, it’s been ongoing, but the next frontier of the whole abortion debate seems like the battle over these, this medication and access to it. Yes, agreed. Well, what about one last thing? What shall we leave us together with?
Danielle Gaines
Well, just a time for Thanksgiving. I figured that we’d talk about food waste, not to be a downer, timely, but our friends at the Iowa capital dispatch covered a study by the State Department of Natural Resources, and that study found that Iowans throw away, on average, 200 pounds of food each year. When you account for industrial food waste. On top of that, it’s about 300 pounds. Wow. And that’s actually less than what the EPA estimates for the country as a whole, which is between 492 pounds and more than 1000 pounds. So this study was just a way to look at how to cut down on food waste, how food waste can be diverted, how to avoid it in the first place. So I thought I’d share some of the tips that I gleaned from it. You know, the first one is to purchase your food thoughtfully, and then, in terms of disposal, you can seek ways to donate something that you don’t want, share it with a neighbor, a friend, compost it instead of sending it to the landfill. My personal favorite is to just immediately freeze. So if you have a veggie tray at Thanksgiving, like, don’t just shove it the back of your fridge to let it waste away. Cut it up right away, put it in a baggie, and then some night, you’ll want soup, and it’ll be right there, ready cut up for you.
Chris Fitzsimon  
That’s a great idea. It does seem at every party, the veggie tray is the last to go.
Danielle Gaines  
I know it’s such a shame. I also think you could waffle iron just about anything. From Thanksgiving, which is a great way to use up leftovers.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Wow, I haven’t thought of that one. I might try that. Do I really appreciate you as always you being with us.
Danielle Gaines  
Yes, thank you so much.

The school is less than a mile away from the construction site of Meta’s new data center, Hyperion. Officials shut down the playground in front of the school because of safety concerns related to the truck traffic. (Dylan Hawkins/Gulf States Newsroom)Penelope Hull doesn’t care that the road in front of her elementary school leads to what will be the largest data center in the world. She just misses the playground in front of Holly Ridge Elementary School.
It’s shut down this year because it faces the roads where, every day, thousands of dump trucks and 18-wheelers thunder toward “Hyperion,” Meta’s $27 billion data center being built less than a mile away.
Holly Ridge is a town of fewer than 2,000 in Richland Parish, in the northeast corner of the state, where nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line. Before Meta broke ground last December, the town’s two-lane roads were quiet, scenic routes mostly used by locals.
Now, the noise from the trucks lined up outside the elementary school shakes the classrooms.
“You can’t pay attention,” Hull, a fourth grader, said. “And then you get off track and you lose what the teacher was telling you to do.”
The school sits tucked in the corner where Highways 80 and 183 meet. At that intersection alone, there have been at least three big truck crashes this year.
“They wrecked into the gate, and then they had to build a whole new gate,” Hull said. “And that’s why they’re saying we shouldn’t go out there… because there’s too many wrecks and Meta trucks. And they could crash.”

On the roads surrounding Meta’s construction site, vehicle crashes have gone up by more than 600%. There have been 64 crashes between January and mid-September this year, compared to just nine for all of 2024, according to police records obtained by the Gulf States Newsroom.
In one crash, two dump trucks collided head-on. The driver who caused it had an expired Mexican driver’s license, and his injuries were so severe, he had to be airlifted to a hospital — with the helicopter landing in a field behind the school.
In a statement to the Gulf States Newsroom, Meta said it sets strict guidelines about speed and safety, but did not respond to questions about specific crashes.
Interviews with residents and crash reports tell a different story: careless, reckless and sometimes unlicensed drivers rumbling through the rural town, endangering everyone.
Hull said she’s heard about trucks colliding and killing a driver, and described a near-miss when she and her grandmother “almost got killed” by an 18-wheeler.
“On the school bus, the trucks make you feel anxious that they’re gonna wreck,” the nine-year-old said. “It’s really bad. I don’t like it.”

He ‘never had a license’
The Hyperion project came together over the course of 2024 through a whirlwind of negotiations and non-disclosure agreements between Meta, Entergy, and state officials who rewrote laws and created new tax exemptions to win the deal. While Meta estimates employing about 5,000 construction workers at the peak of the project, the 4-million-square-foot data center is expected to employ about 500 permanent workers once completed in 2030.
Crashes in Holly Ridge are surging in conjunction with the explosion in traffic around the Hyperion site. Traffic data from Louisiana’s Department of Transportation and Development (LaDOTD) gives a clear picture of how much it’s increased since Meta started construction.
LaDOTD installs temporary traffic count devices on state highways that record the total traffic volume over a 24-hour period. One of those locations is right in front of Holly Ridge Elementary School on Highway 183, which only has three recorded counts in the last 10 years.
A count taken on a school day in February 2022 recorded 1,817 vehicles in one day. The next available count from the same spot was taken in July 2025, showing a jump to 5,224 vehicles — nearly triple the previous count, despite being in the summertime with no school traffic.

In a statement, LaDOTD said Meta has not violated any permits or agreements. But documents obtained by the Gulf States Newsroom show Meta — through its developer Laidley LLC — agreed it was responsible for ensuring public safety and minimizing work zone impacts.
Police crash records suggest that isn’t happening — many of the crashes appear to be caused by drivers in transit to the Meta construction site.
Some happened because the large trucks couldn’t see the smaller vehicles or hear their horns before backing or turning into them. Some, because the driver, who was en route to his workplace at the Meta site, was tired.
Others are more alarming: A hit-and-run where the dump truck left the scene; an 18-wheeler trying to beat an oncoming train across the railroad tracks before deciding against it and backing into another vehicle; a driver leaving the scene, abandoning his wrecked vehicle in the median, so he wouldn’t miss a morning meeting at the Meta site.
In August, a dump truck hauling dirt drove off the road and crashed into a tree, killing the driver, according to Tracy Morris with the Richland Parish Coroner’s Office.
In September, an 18-wheeler collided with a dump truck turning onto the road leading to the Meta site. In the report, the driver told the deputy that “he does not and has never had a driver’s license.”
Greg Fischer, with the Louisiana Highway Safety Commission, said it was “shocking” to hear that one of the drivers heading to Meta’s site was hired without any license, much less the specialized license required to operate large, heavy vehicles like an 18-wheeler or dump truck.
“I don’t understand how that could even happen,” Fischer said. “You would think that a company would vet their drivers — at least to the extent that they have a commercial driver’s license before they put them out on the road.”
Unlicensed drivers operating dump trucks and 18-wheelers, Fischer said, create a “dangerous situation” to both themselves and the community.
“The worst case scenario is a fatality — a fatal crash,” he said.

‘They think they run this road’
In a statement to the Gulf States Newsroom, a spokesperson for Meta said the company strives to be “good neighbors” and to mitigate disturbances to the community. But around a dozen people who live on the roads surrounding Hyperion interviewed by the Gulf States Newsroom say otherwise.
All of them say they’ve never been contacted by the company or any officials — even after filing complaints with the city and law enforcement officials.
“Nobody hadn’t come talk to me about nothing,” said Dorothy Lively, who lives at the corner of Highway 80 and Jaggers Lane, one of the main entrances to the construction site.
Workers park their trucks in her yard without asking. Dust, dirt and sand kicked up from the site get into her home, irritating her sinuses.
She’s “scared to death” about trying to pull out of her own driveway and said she feels trapped in her home.
“It looks like a train, one after another,” she said of the line of trucks that can sometimes stretch for miles on the road in front of her home.
Nearby, on Highway 183, Tatjana Thompson said she waits to walk to her mailbox until the evening, when the traffic slows down, because she’s worried about being hit by one of the trucks bound for Hyperion. She lives directly across the street from the site and workers park in her yard, too.
“They think they run this road,” Thompson said. “I don’t know where they done their driver’s license.”
About a month ago, she said a new 45 miles per hour speed limit sign was put up in front of her home. But the trucks ignore it, she said. The sign is bent at an angle after being hit by a passing vehicle.

‘It’s incumbent of them to be a good steward’
State and parish officials are aware of residents’ concerns.
In June, Gov. Jeff Landry visited Holly Ridge and met with the Richland Parish Sheriff’s Office to discuss complaints. In an interview with TV station KNOE News, he acknowledged the traffic concerns and promised control measures. “I know that it’s causing a lot of traffic problems around this area,” he said. “We’re going to start looking into making sure that we have the proper traffic control to handle the amount of work that’s coming.“Because guess what? That project is transformational for this area, but like all good things, it comes with good problems.”
Landry has called the project a “game-changer” for the state that will bring thousands of jobs and cement Louisiana’s place as a hub for artificial intelligence.
“This facility is a great example of how Louisiana is quickly becoming one of the best states in America to do business,” Landry said, standing at the Meta site, in a video posted on Facebook, the social media site owned by Meta.
Landry’s office and the Richland Parish Sheriff’s Office did not respond to questions for this story. But following Landry’s visit, LaDOTD announced plans to convert three intersections along Highway 80 to “all-way” stops to help control traffic, including the intersection in front of Holly Ridge Elementary School.
But many of the crashes this year occurred after Landry’s visit and the installation of additional all-way stops, including the 18-wheeler racing a train, the helicopter landing at Holly Ridge Elementary, the dump truck driver who died and the unlicensed Freightliner semi-truck operator.
Despite rumors circulating in the community, both Meta and the Richland Parish School Board told the Gulf States Newsroom there are currently no plans to relocate the school.
Meta says it’s investing more than $200 million in local infrastructure improvements. But the fault for the increase in vehicle crashes, according to Brian Wolshon, a researcher who studies highway safety at Louisiana State University, doesn’t lie with the infrastructure. It lies with the drivers and Meta.
“Just because you’re Meta and you’re this trillion-dollar company, and you roll into West Yahoo, Louisiana, and we’re rolling out the red carpet,” Wolshon said, “I think it’s incumbent of them to be a good steward of the public trust.”
While old state highways like 80 and 183 may have been unprepared for a massive influx in heavy truck traffic, even the safest road in the world, Walshon said, can’t prevent careless or reckless drivers from causing crashes.

’They’re constantly turning off the power’
It’s not just increased traffic and crashes that are frustrating residents.
Joseph Williams and his wife, Robin, are also “pissed off” about the data center’s impact on water and electricity.
Though construction won’t be complete until at least 2030, Hyperion will use about three times the amount of power than the entire city of New Orleans uses in a year. To feed the behemoth’s energy demand, the power company, Entergy, plans to spend $3.2 billion to build three new gas-powered plants.
Meta signed a contract with Entergy that has not been publicly disclosed, so it’s unknown how much the international company worth trillions is paying for the additional infrastructure.
In a statement to the Gulf States Newsroom, Entergy said that factoring in the “various costs and benefits, Meta coming to Louisiana means customer bills will be lower than they otherwise would have been,” through Meta contributing large cost-based payments to the energy company.
Those payments, Entergy said, would effectively offset grid upgrade and storm-related costs — reducing what regular ratepayers would otherwise have to pay.
Grid upgrades and storm-related costs are imposed by Entergy, a company that reported earnings of more than $1 billion last year, and contribute to a higher energy burden for ratepayers. Advocates warn the additional costs of building new gas plants to power Meta’s data center could be passed on to Entergy customers across the state as well.
The Williamses live across from the site on Caston Road, and said they’re already being affected.
Since Meta began construction, they said their water sometimes turns “rust-colored” and their electricity cuts off with no warning.


Let us know what you think...


 

“Entergy goes out here all the time. I guess with them now, they’re constantly turning off the power,” Joseph Williams said, pointing to the expanse of dirt, trucks and heavy construction equipment at the Meta site — what was once trees and fields in front of their home.
In one recent instance, they said their power was out for three days. And they tried contacting Entergy for information.
“I blew Entergy up,” Robin Williams said. “They said it’d be back up by 12, by 2, by 4, 8 o’clock the next morning.”
Entergy denied any power outages in the area caused by construction. But the couple said they ended up staying at a friend’s house for the next few days until their power was restored.
The lack of notice and delay, they said, makes them feel “unimportant.”

	New England winters can get wicked cold. This week, five of the region’s states launched a $450 million effort to warm more of the homes in the often-frigid region with energy-efficient, low-emission heat pumps instead by burning fossil fuels.


“It’s a big deal,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ​“It’s unprecedented to see five states aligning together on a transformational approach to deploying more-affordable clean-heat options.”


The New England Heat Pump Accelerator is a collaboration between Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. The initiative is funded by the federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, which was created by President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The accelerator’s launch marks a rare milestone for a Biden-era climate initiative amid the Trump administration’s relentless attempts to scrap federal clean energy and environmental programs.


The goal: Get more heat pumps into more homes through a combination of financial incentives, educational outreach, and workforce development.


New England is a rich target for such an effort because of its current dependence on fossil-fuel heating. Natural gas and propane are in wide use, and heating oil is still widespread throughout the region; more than half of Maine’s homes are heated by oil, and the other coalition states all use oil at rates much higher than the national average. The prevalence of oil in particular means there’s plenty of opportunity to grow heat-pump adoption, cut emissions, and lower residents’ energy bills.


At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.


“There’s not a full awareness that these cold-temperature heat pumps can handle our winters, and do it at a cost that is lower than many of our delivered fuels,” said Joseph DeNicola, deputy commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.


To some degree, the momentum is shifting. Maine has had notable success, hitting its aim of 100,000 new heat pump installations in 2023, two years ahead of its initial deadline. Massachusetts is on track to reach its 2025 target, but needs adoption rates to rise in order to make its 2030 goal.


The accelerator aims to speed up adoption by supporting the installation of some 580,000 residential heat pumps, which would reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tons by 2030 — the equivalent of taking more than 540,000 gas-powered passenger vehicles off the road.


The initiative is organized into three program areas, or ​“hubs,” as planners called them during a webinar kicking off the accelerator this week.


The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps. They will keep a small percentage of the money for themselves and pass most of the savings on to the contractors buying the equipment. The contractors, in turn, will pass the lower price on to the customers. In addition to reducing upfront costs for consumers, this approach is designed to shift the market by encouraging distributors to keep the equipment in stock, therefore making it an easier choice for contractors and their customers.


These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit. When contractors buy the appliances, the incentive will be applied automatically — no extra paperwork or claims process required.

“It should be very simple for contractors to access this funding,” said Ellen Pfeiffer, a senior manager with Energy Solutions, a clean energy consultancy that is helping implement the programming. ​“It should be almost seamless.”


Consumers will also remain eligible for any incentives available through state efficiency programs, such as rebates from Mass Save or Efficiency Maine, but will likely not be able to stack the accelerator benefits with federal incentives like the Home Efficiency Rebates and Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate programs.


Program planners expect to be finalizing the incentive levels through the end of the year, enrolling and training distributors in the early months of 2026, and making the first participating products available in February 2026, said New England Heat Pump Accelerator program manager Jennifer Gottlieb Elazhari.


The second program area is the innovation hub. Each state will receive $14.5million to fund one or two pilot programs testing out new ways to overcome barriers to heat pump adoption by low- and moderate-income households and in disadvantaged communities. One state might, for example, create a lending library of window-mounted air-source heat pumps, allowing someone whose oil heating breaks down the time to research replacement options rather than just installing new oil equipment.


The innovation hub will also include workforce development and training. Organizers are talking with contractors and other partners to figure out where the gaps are in heat pump training. In the first few months of 2026, they will develop a program with a target start date in April.


The goal will be not only to ensure that there are tradespeople with the needed skills to install the systems, but also to lay the groundwork for faster adoption by spreading knowledge about the capabilities of the technology and the available incentives.


The third major area of the accelerator is resource hub to aggregate information for contractors, distributors, program implementers, and other stakeholders. Overall, organizers hope to have all three hubs operational in spring 2026.


Accelerator planners expect programs to boost adoption even as a federal tax credit of up to $2,000 on heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters is phased out at the end of the year, leaving states leading the way on clean energy action.


“At the state level, this is one example of a way we are helping to make progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with a solution that can help people take control of their energy costs,” Dykes said. ​“That’s really what we’re focused on.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1934748893-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-22 05:57:27.318048

Few political alliances in recent American history have seemed as solid as the one between Donald Trump and the country’s farmers. Through three elections, farmers stood by Trump even as tariffs, trade wars and labor shortages squeezed profits.
But Trump’s second term may be different.
A new round of administration policies now cuts deeper into farmers’ livelihoods — not just squeezing profits but reshaping how farms survive — through renewed tariffs on agricultural products, visa restrictions on farm workers, reduced farm subsidies and open favoritism toward South American agricultural competitors.
In the past, farmers’ loyalty to Trump has overridden economics. In our study of the 2018-19 trade war between the U.S. and China, we found that farmers in Trump-voting counties kept planting soybeans even though the trade war’s effects were clear: Their costs would rise and their profits would fall. Farmers in Democratic-leaning counties, by contrast, shifted acreage toward alternatives such as corn or wheat that were likely to be more profitable. For many pro-Trump farmers, political belief outweighed market logic — at least in the short term.
Today, the economic effects of policies affecting farmers are broader and deeper — and the resolve that carried farmers’ support for Trump through the first trade war may no longer be enough.
 
Tariffs: The familiar pain returns
The revived U.S.-China trade conflict has again placed soybeans at its center. In March 2025, Beijing suspended import licenses for several major U.S. soybean exporters following new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump countered with a new round of reciprocal tariffs, broadening the list of Chinese imports hit and raising rates on already targeted goods.
An October 2025 deal promised China would buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans a year, but relief has proved mostly symbolic.
Before the 2018-19 trade war, China regularly imported 30 million to 36 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually — more than one-third of all American soybean exports. Now, Beijing has signed long-term contracts with Brazil and Argentina, leaving U.S. producers with shrinking overseas demand for their crops.
Prices remain roughly 40% to 50% below pre-2018 levels, and farmers are storing record volumes of unsold soybeans.
In 2019, the federal government cushioned those losses with over $23 billion in bailout payments to farmers. This time, Republican leaders show little appetite for another bailout. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s funds for farm relief are running low, leaving farmers with lower prices and less support.
 
Labor: Fewer hands, higher costs
Farms are also short of workers. Roughly 42% of U.S. crop workers lack legal status, according to the National Agricultural Workers Survey. Tougher immigration enforcement and slower visa processing have thinned the labor pool just as production costs are surging. Hired-labor expenses rose 14.4% from 2021 to 2022 and another 15.2% the following year, and costs such as fertilizer, equipment and parts climbed sharply.
Many growers are turning to the H-2A guest worker program — a legal pipeline for seasonal foreign labor that has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But it is expensive: Farms must pay the adverse effect wage rate, a federally set pay rate that is more than twice the regular federal minimum wage. And farms must provide every H-2A worker with free housing and free transportation to and from the U.S., as well as from their housing to the worksite. Large agribusinesses can absorb those costs; small family farms often cannot.
As exports collapsed in late September 2025, the head of the American Soybean Association wrote a public letter to the White House begging for help, saying, “We’ve had your back. We need you to have ours now.” The hard-line immigration policy approach that rallies rural voters is also pushing smaller farms to the brink — forcing them to ask what their loyalty still buys.
 
Subsidies and symbolism: The Argentina shock
The question of the value of farmers’ loyalty sharpened in the fall of 2025 when the U.S. Treasury approved a $20 billion currency-swap deal with Argentina — supporting the country’s president, Javier Milei, a political ally of Trump, while the country remains a direct agricultural competitor.
U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult. Argentina is among the world’s largest soybean exporters, and U.S. farm groups asked why the federal government would underwrite a competitor while trimming support for American producers at home.
The tension deepened when Trump floated the idea of buying Argentinian beef for U.S. markets — a remark one Kansas rancher called “an absolute betrayal.” The plan may be economically minor, but symbolically it pierced the “America First” narrative that had helped hold the farm vote together.
 
Clean energy: The new rural subsidy under threat
For decades, the farm vote relied on federally funded support programs — crop insurance, price guarantees and disaster assistance — which account for a significant share of net farm income. Over the past five years, a quieter lifeline has emerged: renewable energy.
Wind and solar projects have brought jobs, tax revenue and steady lease payments to rural counties that have been losing both population and farm income for decades. Iowa now gets about 63% of its electricity from wind, while Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have seen significant growth.
That momentum has stalled. In August 2025, a U.S. Treasury Department policy change froze billions in rural investment in renewable energy projects. Industry trackers report that prolonged uncertainty has pushed many Midwestern renewable projects into limbo.
For farmers, this isn’t an abstract climate debate — it’s a lost income stream. Leasing land for turbines or solar panels brought in tens of thousands of dollars a year and kept many family farms afloat.
The freeze wipes out one of the few growth engines in rural America and highlights an irony at the heart of Trump’s message: The administration that promises to protect the heartland is dismantling the clean energy investments that were finally helping it diversify.
 
Politics: How deep does loyalty run?
As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course. That loyalty was propped up by subsidies — and by hope. This time, neither cushion is secure.
Many farmers still share Trump’s skepticism of Washington and global elites. But shrinking federal backing, tighter labor and a competitor’s bailout cut close to home. The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss — or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.
No sudden collapse of rural support for Trump is likely; cultural loyalty doesn’t fade overnight. But strain is visible. Farm groups are quietly pressing for pragmatic trade policy and visa reform, and several Republican governors now lobby for labor flexibility rather than tougher enforcement.
If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith — and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.
